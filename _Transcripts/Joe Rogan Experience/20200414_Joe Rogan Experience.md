# Joe Rogan Experience #1457 - Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig9yh8iVZWI)
*  Three, two, one.
*  Later today, young Tim Dillon will find out whether or not he has the antibodies.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And if I do, I'm going to Wuhan to do like a fun little video in a wet market and eat
*  a bat.
*  If I have the antibodies, it's not, it's okay.
*  Is it safe?
*  I don't know what this is.
*  Yeah, no one knows.
*  We've never been in a time where literally nobody knows.
*  I have a string of text messages from Alex Jones that will change your opinion if you
*  smoke enough weed and you don't smoke weed.
*  Were you ever a weed smoker?
*  I smoked a lot of weed for a very long time.
*  That's when I discovered Alex Jones when I was 13 when I was smoking weed listening
*  to him on the GCN network.
*  But when you got clean, it wasn't weed that was a problem, right?
*  No, it was the cocaine and the booze and the pills, but weed was always there.
*  I've never been a cocaine user.
*  I've never used it, but I do love that Buck Cherry song.
*  Oh yeah, it's great.
*  It's great.
*  It almost makes you want to do cocaine.
*  It's a great drug.
*  I mean, don't do it if you're having problems.
*  But Alex left, I haven't even gotten to them because I got, there's a real, I changed my
*  phone number not that long ago and I change it every few months now.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  Do you get random texts from just anybody?
*  Oh yeah, random.
*  Yeah.
*  But this, these are all, all these are voicemail messages and look at all these videos he sent
*  me to watch and all these websites.
*  Are you guys convinced that it's a weaponized virus that leaked from a lab?
*  Well, there's a lot of people that are saying that in Wuhan, obviously they have that lab,
*  right?
*  Whether it's a bio defense or bio research laboratory, something's there, something's
*  there, something in Wuhan where the disease is somebody said, now this is kind of convincing
*  that maybe there were people set back door selling the animals that they were experimenting
*  to wet markets.
*  Like if you're broke and you regard at the Wuhan lab, you're like, Hey, I'm just selling
*  bats and dogs for extra money.
*  And he sold maybe one of the wrong ones.
*  And now we have this issue.
*  Really?
*  Where'd you hear that?
*  I mean, that's on the internet, Joe.
*  Well, as long as it's on the internet.
*  But I mean, but now every theory has as much weight as any other theory.
*  Right now.
*  Right now.
*  There's some legit scientists that are actually like one of the things they found out is that
*  the origins of the virus in New York City, it comes directly from Europe.
*  Apparently, they can tell that.
*  Interesting.
*  Somehow.
*  I have no idea.
*  Find out how they can tell.
*  Do they trace it back to like patient zero?
*  With the first part?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  I don't think so.
*  They do some sort of tracing, right?
*  Because that's the new.
*  Yeah.
*  I just love Google and Apple working together to get tracing software.
*  See, that's what scares me.
*  We talked about that the other day.
*  If you have to have everything on your phone, like showing that you're positive.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you have to have a phone everywhere.
*  You have to take out your car that you're positive to get into Apple base.
*  Yeah.
*  Adam Curry.
*  You have antibodies.
*  Sent me this, this whole thing saying this is why I have a flip phone.
*  Yeah.
*  You know Adam Curry, the original pod father.
*  And he's saying that he won't.
*  He won't do it.
*  Yeah.
*  Most coronavirus cases in New York City can be traced back to Europe, not Asia, research
*  shows.
*  What is the research, though?
*  What does it say?
*  The data tracking spread of coronavirus determined that the virus has been circulating in New
*  York City for a couple of months since before the testing began.
*  Genetic sequencing of virus samples indicates that most of the early cases in New York originated
*  in Europe, not Asia.
*  So it's some sort of genetic sequencing.
*  Research teams studied samples of the virus taken from 91 New York patients.
*  As viruses evolve during transmission from person to person, their sequences can help
*  research.
*  This is what scares the fuck out of me.
*  Just that statement.
*  As viruses evolve.
*  Yeah.
*  During transmission.
*  These fucking things, they morph and twist.
*  It seems like it's almost like a different thing with different people.
*  Like I was reading about George Stephanopoulos and his wife.
*  He has it.
*  His wife has it.
*  His wife is deathly ill.
*  He doesn't feel a goddamn thing.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they're also, the media is not helping.
*  No.
*  Because there's a lot of, they're circulating these stories that aren't necessarily the
*  truth or they're not like, the media will be like, coronavirus lives 13 feet away.
*  And then you read the article and buried in the article, they go, well, doctors don't
*  really know if these particles are infectious.
*  Or so it's like, why do you have an article where the boldface headline is coronavirus
*  13 feet away, 19 feet away?
*  And then in the article, you go, well, you haven't even determined if you can get sick.
*  It's very irresponsible.
*  But that's what they do today.
*  News is strange today because they're just trying to sell papers or not papers.
*  They're trying to sell clicks.
*  They want people to pay attention to their articles.
*  So everything's click bait.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fucking real weird, man.
*  And then the other half of that is nobody, the guys who don't believe anything where
*  they're on Twitter, a nurse will put something on Twitter.
*  She's like, you know, uh, you know, it's been a rough day and she's crying.
*  And then the first tweet, a guy's like, liar.
*  It's like, oh my God, there are people that are like, you're a liar.
*  I know what's going on.
*  I'm like, conflict actor.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a crisis actor.
*  Oh, show me the ward.
*  Like there's people being demanded to get into ERs, you know, they're like, show me
*  the ER.
*  Show me.
*  It's a God.
*  Tick tock with nurses.
*  See, that's crazy.
*  Well, here's the deal.
*  There are some places where the hospitals are overwhelmed and there's some places where
*  the hospitals are empty.
*  You know why?
*  Yeah.
*  Because the world big.
*  Okay.
*  It's just like grizzly bears.
*  You know, if you're like, well, grizzly bears are almost extinct.
*  Go to fucking Wyoming and get eaten.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  If you're in Wyoming and you're camping, you might get eaten.
*  Right.
*  They're there.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of them in Montana.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're not in New York City.
*  But even in a hospital that's not busy, some nurses got to go, let's not do the tick tock
*  dance today.
*  I don't know.
*  Some nurses got to go, hey guys, let's not do the tick tock dance today.
*  Bullshit.
*  Cut them a break.
*  I don't know.
*  They should be able to do whatever the fuck they want.
*  I don't know, man.
*  Even if you're in an empty hospital and you're a nurse, you might deal with a COVID-19 patient.
*  You might get it.
*  You might die.
*  That's tough.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very bad.
*  I say let them dance.
*  I don't know.
*  How do you get those balloons to puff their asses out?
*  This is what I mean.
*  I mean, this is what I mean.
*  There's probably COVID patients dying while they're doing that.
*  You know?
*  Maybe not.
*  I don't know.
*  Who knows?
*  That's possible too.
*  I don't know what to believe.
*  I don't know.
*  One day I wake up, I go, this virus is fake.
*  The next day I wake up, I go, I'm going to die today.
*  So I don't know what to believe.
*  You know when it gets me?
*  Yeah.
*  In the middle of the night.
*  In the middle of the night.
*  I'm a moron and I like to drink a lot of water before I go to bed like an asshole.
*  So I wake up at like three o'clock in the morning.
*  I convince myself I don't have to pee.
*  I'm like please just stay in bed.
*  And then I get up and piss like a racehorse.
*  And while I'm peeing, then I start thinking.
*  What if it changes?
*  What if it gets worse?
*  What if it becomes like the H1N1 flu?
*  What if it becomes as deadly as one of these horrific flus but transmits the same way that
*  this one?
*  It's like running all these scenarios.
*  It's interesting.
*  It's like I also think about, and I'm not saying the virus is not organic.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  You know what I mean?
*  People say it could be manmade.
*  But look at the world before this happened, right?
*  You had the Yellow Vest protests in France.
*  You had the Hong Kong protests.
*  You had a lot of populist movements, a lot of uprisings in first world countries like
*  France.
*  You saw things happening that you didn't see before.
*  And after the virus, you know, after this has gotten bad, now that's impossible.
*  You can't protest.
*  You can't do anything now.
*  You can't leave your house.
*  Yes.
*  But I think it's way more likely that what we're dealing with is just a virus.
*  And that this is the consequences of the virus is that things are getting locked down.
*  me is this idea that once you get control of people, that they're not going to let go.
*  That if they start taking away civil liberties, if they started moving you through checkpoints
*  when you want to travel and you're on your car, you have to wait and they have to, you
*  know, scan you or check your temperature, like that stuff.
*  I mean, are they going to let that go once a vaccine gets through?
*  No.
*  But 9-11, all of that is still left in place, right?
*  All the powers, all the powers that the federal government gave themselves after 9-11 have
*  only been expanded in the year since.
*  Obama only expanded Bush era, you know, executive power and he's been able to do.
*  And now everybody's like concerned now, but it's like the time to be concerned was probably
*  a long time ago, you know, because now these things have become so big and so Orwellian,
*  like, I mean, you know, but yet this is going to be a problem.
*  I think it'll be possible that you won't be able to get into maybe a sporting event or
*  a concert without walking through like some type of infrared sensor that detects if you
*  have a fever.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  You know, they're going to.
*  Well, they're doing it in China and China.
*  They're testing your temperature.
*  Fever gone.
*  Yeah, they have a little gun and test your temperature.
*  If you have a temperature, they put you in a they cremate you, they cremate you and put
*  you in an urn.
*  So it's a good way to get the virus when it's young.
*  Did you see the protests that they did have where the people were protesting because they're
*  building a crematorium near them?
*  No, that's hilarious.
*  Yeah, it's dark.
*  I mean, it's dark.
*  So they don't want a crematorium near them.
*  Well, it's not that they they're protesting for a bunch of reasons.
*  But the real concern is that they're killing people that have the disease.
*  Yeah.
*  The real concern is that they're lying about the number of people that died from the disease.
*  Like only three thousand people died from the disease.
*  Two hundred thousand had it.
*  Right.
*  We killed them.
*  Right.
*  They're right.
*  Ten million had it.
*  Yeah, they're they're in an urn.
*  You got it?
*  The 21 million cell phone thing was spooky.
*  Locals protest against cremation of doc.
*  No, that's not it.
*  No, no, there's a crematorium here.
*  I'll send it to you.
*  Give me just give me a second.
*  Do you do?
*  Do you do?
*  China is efficient.
*  Here's the thing with China.
*  They're an efficient country and they're not emotional.
*  No, and they get things done weird way of putting it.
*  Well, it's I'm putting a positive spin on it.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm sure that, you know, listen, there are negatives to that level of efficiency.
*  Here, Jamie, I'm sending to you right now.
*  Protest break out in China last month over crematorium plans in Mao Ming.
*  Yeah.
*  Chinese riot police fired tear gas and beat up protesters at Guangdong province.
*  Have you ever been there?
*  Have you ever did shows there or anything like that?
*  No, but I have gone through the airport in Taiwan, which they won't they won't admit
*  is it's like Taiwan is not a part of China, according to them.
*  China thinks Taiwan doesn't exist.
*  And so the World Health Organization, did you see that whole thing where the guy wouldn't
*  admit that Taiwan was a place right there?
*  We're asking him about Taiwan.
*  He's like, I think China's done a wonderful job.
*  Yeah.
*  What about Taiwan?
*  He's like click.
*  Right.
*  Came back.
*  Well, we'd lost you right before we were talking about Taiwan.
*  I was like, yes.
*  Well, let's move on.
*  Yeah.
*  China's done a wonderful job.
*  Like they're in the pocket.
*  It's a real country.
*  Yes.
*  They're in the pocket of China.
*  Of course.
*  When we were there, what's shocking is they're accustomed to violating people's space.
*  Right.
*  They just bump into you.
*  I mean, they bump into you like people.
*  Yeah.
*  They walk right through.
*  Well, there's so many of them, right?
*  They're used to just walking right through you.
*  But I saw this old lady walk right through my 10 year old, just walk right through her
*  on a plane.
*  Just boom.
*  Knocked her out the way.
*  My daughter's like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  She's got fucked up by an elderly Chinese woman.
*  It was this weird thing.
*  If we were in Alabama, I would fucking crack this lady.
*  Right.
*  But here we are in China.
*  It's their culture.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, all right.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  You just got to let it go.
*  It's just how it goes.
*  Got to let it go.
*  Not being rude is like a part of what they do.
*  This is what they do.
*  They just walk right over people.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of people.
*  That's why China's like, we can stand to lose a few.
*  Yeah.
*  They definitely have a lower value of people.
*  If you have, I mean, that just makes sense.
*  If there's a billion people, you care about them less than...
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know how much.
*  We don't care about numbers.
*  Yeah.
*  We don't care about people here that much though.
*  Here?
*  Yeah.
*  You don't think so?
*  No.
*  I mean, not that much.
*  Well, if we didn't care about people, we wouldn't be doing what we're doing.
*  I know that we do care about people, but we also have a lot of people going out, exposed,
*  working in supermarkets, places like that, and we're not doing anything for them.
*  You know?
*  Why do they wear masks?
*  What are we doing for them?
*  Some of them don't have masks.
*  I mean, I think those people should get paid, holiday pay or extra pay.
*  Hazard pay.
*  They should be given the right equipment.
*  They should probably get some...
*  They should probably give them some low interest rate loans.
*  I think it's just a function of the fact that the supermarkets weren't prepared for a pandemic.
*  I don't think that they don't care.
*  But they're also...
*  I think if you just look at the fact that we shut everything down, well, why did we
*  shut everything down?
*  We shut everything down to protect old people.
*  This is the whole idea behind this.
*  Old people and vulnerable people.
*  Yeah, I know some young people die, but it's a very low percentage.
*  Yes, it's mainly old people.
*  It's mainly old people.
*  And they did a thing on California, how many people died.
*  We have a very low number of people that have died.
*  I think there's something like 30 people died yesterday.
*  And that was the high.
*  Yeah, that's not bad.
*  No, it's not.
*  It's far less than 80.
*  It's far less than people who would have died had we let everyone out of their houses.
*  Yeah, most of them were like 65 to 80, and a few of them, like a couple, were 40 to 60.
*  Which that starts to get...
*  Yeah, that gets weird.
*  It gets weird.
*  But you got to go, okay.
*  High risk category.
*  What happened?
*  Were you on some other medication that made you vulnerable?
*  Were you ill already?
*  Did you have some sort of a lung disorder?
*  Were you a smoker?
*  Yeah, a lot of smokers are getting it hard, man.
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't smoke every day, but I'll have a cigarette occasionally, like outside
*  a comedy store.
*  And now I don't do that at all because I don't want to be drowning.
*  They say you feel like you're drowning when you have this.
*  You feel like you can't get a breath because you're drowning.
*  I don't want... no cigarette is worth that.
*  Well, that's also how you die for cigarettes, man.
*  Well, that's a good point.
*  But years from now.
*  But if I do have the antibody test, if I have antibodies, I will just smoke an entire pack
*  of Marlboro Lights tonight.
*  See, this is what we were talking about earlier.
*  I don't believe that they know whether or not you can catch this thing twice.
*  I know, that's true.
*  You know, in China, people have tested twice.
*  Well, that could have been a false positive on either end.
*  Or it could be that you get it again.
*  It's true.
*  Yeah, I don't think they know yet.
*  That's true.
*  If this really is some sort of a man-made concocted virus, maybe that makes sense.
*  Maybe that makes sense that that's why it's acting so weird.
*  It's different in different people.
*  They don't understand it.
*  I mean, or maybe it's just a really peculiar virus.
*  Right.
*  And that's why it can come back.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't know.
*  This is a big NPR article.
*  People are testing positive again who had been confirmed as negative in Wuhan.
*  I think, yeah, in China and then Korea, they had a few of those cases.
*  I trust the Korean ones way more than the Chinese ones.
*  South Korea, yeah.
*  South Korea said 14% or something amount of people seem to have tested positive again,
*  which is scary because that could be another strain.
*  Or it could be like herpes.
*  It stays in your system and pops out again, like when your immune system is down.
*  Or if we've all had it in five years, we're all going to die.
*  You know, my buddy Justin Ren, he runs this nonprofit charity organization, Fight for
*  the Forgotten.
*  They build wells for the Pygmies in the Congo.
*  And he got malaria when he was in the Congo.
*  And he got it again.
*  He's got it three times.
*  But he got it one time when he got sick.
*  When he was home.
*  He got sick at home and the malaria came back.
*  Oh.
*  It came back.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's fucked.
*  That's fucked.
*  So it was like it was somehow or another dormant in his system.
*  And then when his immune system was shattered by whatever cold or flu he got, the malaria
*  kicked back in again.
*  Did he take that hydroxychloroquine?
*  I don't know what he took.
*  He's taken a bunch of different shit.
*  And he actually got really sick.
*  What was that stuff that he said he got sick from?
*  Jamie, he actually had toxic doses of this one malaria medication.
*  They've had issues with soldiers and people that are deployed in malaria infested areas
*  stuff and they get this toxic reaction to this stuff.
*  And he had taken much more than they were taking.
*  He had taken a very large dose.
*  He didn't know that it was like really toxic until...
*  Well yeah, that drug, the drug, hydroxychloroquine is working.
*  People say that it is.
*  I've talked to doctors that say it is absolutely helping people, but it's a very serious drug.
*  So you have to be careful with it.
*  But they say it's like the Lazarus effect.
*  People are getting up and walking out of hospitals.
*  You know?
*  Like it is doing that.
*  It's good to think.
*  It's good to think.
*  Whitney has some of it in her house.
*  Does she?
*  Yeah, she's got it all.
*  She's got a ventilator.
*  She's killing it.
*  She has a ventilator?
*  She's got two ventilators.
*  No, I'm kidding.
*  I'm joking.
*  I don't want to get her in trouble.
*  No, she's got the hydroxy.
*  She's got a zithromycin.
*  I mean, she's ready.
*  She's ready to go.
*  But that's the thing.
*  If you've done well and you're successful, you can go out and get all the things.
*  That's partially...
*  It's like guys like me are in trouble, but guys like yourself, you can get a very good
*  ventilator.
*  I'll hook you up.
*  If I had a ventilator, I'd take care of you.
*  You could have a ventilator immediately almost, if you wanted a ventilator.
*  That's great.
*  I'm much more concerned with strengthening my immune system.
*  Right.
*  That's what I'm doing.
*  Do you think we take too many over-the-counter medications and that kills our immune system?
*  Well, for some people, they definitely do.
*  Some people take a lot of antibiotics.
*  Because my mother growing up would take Sudafed.
*  She'd take all that stuff.
*  That stuff's terrible for you.
*  It's bad for you.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, one of the things is ibuprofen.
*  Michael Yeoh told me that one of his buddies, who's a doctor, when he was feeling really
*  shitty before they diagnosed him with COVID-19, his doctor said, or this doctor, who's a friend
*  of his, said, take, I believe he said, take three Advil or three to five, I forget what
*  the number was, every...
*  How many milligrams are they?
*  Advil?
*  I don't know.
*  So he told him, take three every five hours.
*  And he said he immediately got much worse.
*  And I've heard this from many people.
*  Now, I don't know if there's a connection, and I've read that there isn't a connection.
*  But according to Michael Yeoh, that was when it was a tipping point for him, when he started
*  taking ibuprofen.
*  Wow.
*  These non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.
*  That stuff is terrible for you.
*  France said not to take it.
*  France said take acetaminophen.
*  Take the other...
*  Veterans say report on anti-malaric dro...
*  That's right.
*  Deflequin downplays side effects.
*  See this is the...
*  That's the stuff that Justin took.
*  Yeah, and he took a huge dose of it.
*  And he got really fucked up from that stuff too.
*  So that's what disturbs me, is that things could be a virus that stays somehow or another
*  in your body.
*  Yeah, that's creepy.
*  Herpes is a virus, right?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you keep that shit for life?
*  You keep it forever.
*  You keep it forever.
*  So these are...
*  Yeah.
*  Well, HIV, at least your body tests negative.
*  Are they only testing for the antibodies when we take this test?
*  Yes.
*  Well, they can do the test test if you'd like to test test.
*  They do a swab.
*  Don't be scared.
*  Come on, bro.
*  I think it would be funny if people were getting negative for corona, but then somebody's like,
*  you do have HIV.
*  That would be hilarious to me.
*  HIV is not that big a deal anymore.
*  It's not a big deal.
*  Yeah, for me it would be fine.
*  The doctor would be like, it's the healthiest thing about you, HIV.
*  They'd be like, AIDS helps you.
*  We'd be like, this is great.
*  AIDS is fighting off the flu.
*  Have you had the thing done?
*  AIDS is like, he's mine.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Yeah, I had the antibody done.
*  I don't have anything.
*  Is it?
*  Okay.
*  I was hoping I had the antibodies, but I was...
*  I want the antibodies.
*  Yes.
*  I was hoping that I caught it and I fought it off.
*  I want the antibodies so that Meghan McCain can go to Wuhan, eat a bat.
*  Eat a bat.
*  That would be fun.
*  Could I fly to China?
*  Would I be allowed to fly to China if I had the antibodies?
*  I'm going to Wuhan.
*  You should do a comedy special as Meghan McCain.
*  Your whole special as Meghan.
*  She's already going to have me killed.
*  I left her alone.
*  She had a pregnancy announcement.
*  I'm like, I'm not going to do a joke about that.
*  God bless.
*  Congrats.
*  She hates me.
*  Do you think she does?
*  Yeah, I know somebody who knows her well.
*  She doesn't like me.
*  You know, it is what it is.
*  I get it.
*  It's fine.
*  I don't get it.
*  A lot of the people I've made fun of in that sense don't like me.
*  Okay, but you're not really her.
*  Okay, you're doing a character.
*  That is true.
*  That is true.
*  I agree, but people are very sensitive.
*  We live in a very sensitive world.
*  I guess.
*  And I did say she wanted to have sex with her dad.
*  Yeah, but it was funny.
*  Very funny.
*  But part of that, I think, disturbed her.
*  What made her mad is that she told a friend of mine, she goes, I didn't like that he made
*  fun of my weight, which is interesting.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  Because I said she had a baby with her dad.
*  She didn't care about that.
*  But she didn't like it.
*  That's the weight thing.
*  But you know, a big guy putting a wig on saying, I'm you.
*  It's not exactly, it's not, you know, positive.
*  It's not flattering.
*  That's the word.
*  Yeah, it's not flattering.
*  But this is what comedy rarely is.
*  But now in a pandemic, everyone's got like the woke shit's got to be over now.
*  Right?
*  It's not.
*  It's coming back.
*  The woke is we're in a pandemic.
*  I understand.
*  But the liberals are at home with nothing to do for a month.
*  And then they're firing it.
*  They're writing articles like this is a gendered crisis.
*  Nurses are women.
*  It's like, oh, God, enough.
*  Well, Bill Maher went hard in the paint.
*  He did.
*  And he was right.
*  He was right.
*  Yeah.
*  He was totally right because he was defending the use of the term Chinese virus, but really
*  correctly termed it would be the Wuhan virus.
*  Yeah, but everyone.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Everyone knows that it originated in China.
*  Yes.
*  But if you call it the Wuhan virus, it would be historically accurate.
*  Right.
*  Because racists who are going to do hate crimes wouldn't know if Wuhan was in China.
*  Like they would be like, is it somewhere I'm saying?
*  You're generalizing an entire continent or an entire country, at least enormous country.
*  It's just a subset, a small section of it that had the virus.
*  Well, it's like the examples they used was like Lyme disease came from Lyme, Connecticut.
*  But if if if if if something came out of Colorado and it was killing everybody, Rocky Mountain
*  ticks, would they say in China, would they call it that in China?
*  Would they say the US flu, the American bug?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, you know, someone in Chinese.
*  I mean, there's it's a way to generalize it.
*  It's sloppy.
*  But listen, this is the way it's been done for years.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a clear reason why.
*  Look, Trump, first of all, they were in heated trade negotiations with China.
*  Right.
*  So he wants to rub it in their face.
*  China, China.
*  Yeah.
*  And he also wants to take attention away from the fact that we were not prepared and he
*  knew and everyone knew not only him, Nancy Pelosi, all of these people, even Fauci, all
*  of these guys came out and said this is nothing to worry about.
*  But Trump is the president.
*  The buck stops with him.
*  He could have ordered tests.
*  He could have been more vigilant.
*  He didn't do it.
*  Well, they were all saying not to worry about it.
*  Everyone, the World Health Organization in January was saying that it does not transmit
*  from person to person.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you listen, if you're skeptical of China and you're skeptical of the World Health
*  Organization, as he's very skeptical of China, you got to.
*  But the World Health Organization up until then had not been criticized the way it's
*  been criticized now.
*  Of course.
*  But you still have to, I think if you're the president, you're in a leadership position,
*  you have to be like, wait a minute, what are we not knowing?
*  The CIA wrote him a memo saying this could be a big problem.
*  I mean, we knew we were watching it happen for two months in another country.
*  We're watching this happen in China.
*  And I'm not saying that he could have prevented the pandemic, but like, dude, get the tests.
*  Give them to New York.
*  Give them to certain big areas.
*  You know, have the scale up the testing.
*  So what do you think did wrong?
*  He didn't scale up the test?
*  I don't think he scaled up.
*  No, he didn't scale up the test.
*  I don't know if it's first of all, is it him?
*  Is he the one who does this?
*  Is the president?
*  If he said, yeah.
*  Okay, but stop.
*  How do you, do you even know?
*  When you say he should have done this, do you even know what was possible?
*  Yeah, I think he could.
*  Well, first of all, he could have the Defense Production Act, which I don't think he's,
*  he could have invoked that after this happened to force companies to make certain things.
*  Right.
*  But there was a lot of people that were thinking that this was just going to be like the flu.
*  If the president of the United States said we need more tests for this, there's absolutely
*  we would have had more tests.
*  But do you understand that they didn't even have a test?
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's a novel coronavirus.
*  Of course, it's a new thing.
*  Yeah, but there were tests in other countries that were being used.
*  I mean, Germany did this, right?
*  What did they do?
*  They had more testing.
*  They've had their mortality rates down.
*  They've had to kept their mortality rates down.
*  They think there's a bunch of reasons why Germany kept their mortality rates down.
*  Well, it's a very, you know, the culture, but here's the other thing.
*  You know, Taiwan did it.
*  South Korea.
*  I mean, now they're having second waves, but like up until recently, Taiwan had very few
*  cases just right by China.
*  But again, a lot of it was testing.
*  I think the China virus issue helps him deflect from any.
*  And I mean, listen, you can't go out during a pandemic when nurses were in garbage bags
*  and falling down and go, hey, my press conferences are getting the biggest ratings they've ever
*  gotten.
*  That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.
*  I mean, you can't do that.
*  I mean, that's crazy.
*  No, that was just crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  But that's him.
*  He's a fucking weird guy, man.
*  But he also did shut down travel from China.
*  That was good.
*  That was smart.
*  People were saying he was a racist.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Chuck Schumer should be held to account for that.
*  Yeah, yeah, they really should, because that was the correct thing to do.
*  I don't think he could have prevented this.
*  I'm just saying there's got to be a better system than the one we have where states are
*  like bidding for this equipment.
*  Like there's got to be a way.
*  And that $1,200 stimulus that people get to get is not helping anybody.
*  No, that's not enough.
*  No.
*  But when you say states are bidding, what are you talking about?
*  I mean, states are I don't think the federal government has the ability or we don't have
*  the ability to get states equipment.
*  So states are like bidding for it.
*  There's something going on where like a lot of states are going outside the system to
*  like secure their which part part of their responsibility is to do.
*  But it's just there's got to be a better system going forward.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they didn't see this coming.
*  I mean, in terms of needing ventilators, like you go back to November or December, nobody
*  thought that three months from now, the entire country is going to be shut down.
*  We're going to need ventilators everywhere.
*  No, of course not.
*  And some hospitals may not need ventilators.
*  You got to look at a city like New York and you got to look at what's happening in China
*  and you got to go there's a high population density there.
*  We should probably try to shore up some of those hospitals.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, otherwise, what the hell does you know, but isn't it the people who run the
*  hospitals, the administration of the hospitals isn't their responsibility to make sure that
*  they have PPE in place.
*  The fact these people wearing garbage bags, they don't have enough masks.
*  Well, I don't think any hospitals prepared for a pandemic.
*  So if you're I don't think well, I mean, the hospital, I think certain people have to direct
*  them to do that.
*  Right.
*  And if it's just masks, how the fuck don't they have a large supply of masks on hand?
*  It's not financially prohibitive.
*  I mean, that I don't know.
*  I have no idea.
*  But they don't know.
*  But there's got to be some there's got to be some responsibility.
*  Yeah.
*  Either it might be state government, could be local government, but there's got to be
*  some responsibility.
*  Yeah.
*  Somebody fucked up.
*  Somebody fucked up.
*  But it's also a new thing.
*  I mean, we haven't had to deal with something like this before.
*  Well, we had H1N1.
*  We had swine flu.
*  Right.
*  How did they stop that?
*  I don't know.
*  But that didn't seem to have that.
*  That's hilarious.
*  No, that's amazing.
*  Really?
*  Well, that's not funny.
*  Sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  He said he was sick as he's ever been in constant pain.
*  So he couldn't sleep.
*  I don't remember hearing that much about swine flu.
*  He was probably hammered.
*  He probably saw something about swine flu as he was passing out.
*  And he's like, I have that's why I have swine flu.
*  That's what I have.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know, man.
*  It's I mean, all we're doing is just talking.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the thing.
*  It's like everybody's sort of talking around in circles.
*  And we're hoping it gets better.
*  I tell people I'm a microbiologist now because nobody knows anything so I can know as much
*  as anyone else.
*  And the governor wants to shut down this state for another month.
*  Today's the 13th, another month and two days, which is kind of crazy.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  I don't know if that'll happen.
*  What do you mean?
*  He's the governor.
*  People are going to go out.
*  My friend called me the other day.
*  He goes, hey, man, you want to come to an Easter thing?
*  I'm like, wait, what?
*  He's like, yeah, it's only like 12 people.
*  I'm like, I don't think that's...
*  I'm like, you know, and then he sent me pictures of it.
*  It looked beautiful.
*  But, you know, it was in Beverly Hills.
*  I'm mad I didn't go.
*  What if three weeks later half of them are dead?
*  Well, I mean, hopefully they are.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because I didn't go.
*  So I hope they die.
*  I hope they drop dead.
*  I hope you made a good decision.
*  Yeah.
*  I look now and I want to choose who dies.
*  I go, I'd like them to go.
*  Who do you choose?
*  Just friends of mine that I've had enough of.
*  Yeah.
*  Just people I could...
*  What gets you?
*  Is it...
*  You know what gets me?
*  Yeah.
*  Is it the time to go on stage?
*  Well, that's annoying.
*  It's time to go.
*  That's annoying.
*  I had a good set.
*  I watched a little bit of it.
*  There was a guy in Long Island who used to tell us all the time when we were very young
*  at comedy, he'd sit in the green room and he would give us a speech about how to do
*  stand up.
*  And then he'd go on stage and bomb horribly.
*  And then he'd walk off stage and then look at us and he would go, they were good.
*  And he would just walk out.
*  Like, he wasn't even there.
*  Some people aren't even there.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't even know what's happening.
*  They don't know if the audience is applauding or not.
*  Well, they put up a shield.
*  They put up some sort of a psychic shield to protect themselves from reality.
*  Yeah.
*  Not good.
*  A lot of people are doing that.
*  But isn't that the case?
*  Like, the guys who give the most advice in the green room before they go on stage, the
*  ones who suck the most?
*  Yeah.
*  It's always horrible.
*  Nobody...
*  And I was in sales.
*  Nobody who ever made money gave you advice.
*  They just walked by you like you didn't exist.
*  Everyone who sits down, it's true.
*  Everybody who's making money walks by you like you're not real.
*  When somebody starts bullshitting, like in sales, I used to give people advice.
*  I would close no deals.
*  I'd make no money.
*  I would literally make no money.
*  What were you selling?
*  I was selling with subprime mortgages.
*  Oh, boy.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was good for a while.
*  And then the government got involved and ruined that.
*  Ruin that.
*  We were just trying to help people.
*  And, you know, we were.
*  People deserve homes, Joe, whether they have jobs or not.
*  They deserve to have a pool.
*  They were giving people homes with no jobs.
*  Well, that's the other thing.
*  Everybody goes back and they're like everybody was, you know, the banks robbed all these
*  people.
*  It's like they were in on it.
*  Everyone was in on it.
*  Everybody buying a house for the most part knew what they were doing.
*  They all knew.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  All the time.
*  You would have to call somebody.
*  They knew, but they thought they could pull it off.
*  You'd have to call somebody and be like, hey, you know, you know, you know, your brother
*  owns a Toyota dealership in Queens.
*  Can he say you work there?
*  And they go, yeah, of course.
*  Some guy would just write like, yeah, Sarah works here.
*  She kills it.
*  She makes eight grand a month slinging Toyota's on North the Boulevard.
*  None of it was true.
*  And then we'd give her a loan for four hundred thousand dollars.
*  She'd buy a house.
*  Yeah.
*  And she'd buy a house.
*  And then she'd see those.
*  And then the thing about the the changing of the mortgage payments.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what really two years or two years you would get.
*  There was something called the pick a payment option.
*  I mean, it's great.
*  So you have four options to pay, you know, usually a mortgage.
*  You pay your principal interest, taxes and insurance here.
*  You had four.
*  One was like you could pay one percent like a credit card.
*  Pay one percent.
*  You could pay only interest.
*  That was the second option.
*  You could pay 30 year regular option or you could pay like a 15 year if you really wanted
*  to pay it off quickly.
*  Nobody paid the 15 or the 30.
*  Very few people did the interest.
*  Only they did one percent.
*  So that deferred interest.
*  And so you would pay your mortgage and it would balloon.
*  It would go up like you would pay one percent and your mortgage would go up every year.
*  And then eventually you got to a point where then it would just readjust and your mortgage
*  payment would go up like twenty seven hundred dollars.
*  And didn't your mortgage adjust with some of them depending upon the market?
*  Yeah. So like two years into a loan, two or three years into a loan, I had a house.
*  I bought a house. It was twenty two.
*  This was not smart.
*  But when you're drunk and on cocaine, you I sold myself a hat like you're not supposed
*  to. Seven hundred thousand.
*  What? Six hundred fifty thousand dollars.
*  Yeah. Well, you know, that's a big rule.
*  You're not supposed to scam yourself.
*  I scammed myself.
*  That was, you know, but when you're on cocaine, you're twenty two.
*  Yeah. I bought a six hundred fifty thousand dollars house in Long Island.
*  Yeah. It was not. It was not the best choice.
*  It was big. It had an acre lot going back.
*  It was deep. I thought they were going to developers were going to sell like I would
*  just stand outside, mass smoking cigarettes, being like developers are eventually going
*  to buy up my yard like I was, you know, on drugs.
*  And I thought this was all going to work out.
*  And I had a two year mortgage and then it ballooned and it went from what it was to
*  like, you know, it went up like how much you pay in a month.
*  I think in the beginning it was forty four hundred in the beginning.
*  That was a good payment. And then it would like, yeah, it was bad.
*  That's a lot. It's a lot of money.
*  Getting it's a lot. It was a lot of money.
*  Yeah. But I rented the house.
*  Yeah. I rented the house out.
*  What did it balloon to? It ballooned to like well over six.
*  So, yeah, it was well over six.
*  And then that was the first adjustment. Yeah.
*  It was a problem to hold 22.
*  And I was working in mortgages and I thought it was going to work out.
*  Like I thought we were all going to be OK because everybody I knew was, you know,
*  27 years old and they were making thirty thousand dollars a month and they were
*  driving like, you know, Porsches.
*  So I said, this is just going to go on forever.
*  So at present, George W.
*  Bush said we were building an ownership society.
*  You had to make a hundred grand a year just to pay your mortgage.
*  Yeah. After taxes. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It was it was it was destined to fail.
*  When I look back now, it wasn't smart.
*  Did they take it from you?
*  But I don't know. I just left one day. What?
*  I just walked out. Yeah. Just one day I left.
*  I mean, you can't stay.
*  Whoever's coming is going to be.
*  So they just possessed it.
*  I would imagine they took it. Yes.
*  I mean, it was 10 years ago.
*  A credit card.
*  I mean, I'm in L.A. now dressing up as Megan McCain.
*  So I would imagine I just got my credit reestablished recently.
*  I just got it reestablished. Yeah.
*  That's hilarious. Yeah. Well, not it.
*  It's not good yet. It's got to get seven years.
*  I just write you as a co-signer on everything.
*  I just write Joe Rogan.
*  No, but it's it's seven years, seven years before it fell off the credit report.
*  I had a buddy of mine who knew that he was going to go bankrupt.
*  Yes. Was in the 90s, like early 2000s.
*  Yeah. So he decided what he was going to do was get a bunch of credit cards
*  and run them up like good for him.
*  That's the American dream.
*  So what he did was just go to strip clubs.
*  Yeah. And go crazy with his credit cards for months and months and months
*  and never paid anything.
*  Yes. He knew what he was going to do and then went bankrupt.
*  Listen, smart. Trump's done it a bunch like bankruptcy is the move.
*  If you know, I didn't go bankrupt bankrupt.
*  Or his businesses went bankrupt.
*  He filed chapter whatever it is.
*  Chapter 11. I mean, it's smart.
*  A lot of people do it.
*  I mean, it's the way it's the way to live.
*  You know, it's interesting.
*  You can never do that with student loans.
*  Well, student loans, because they think that whatever money you make in your life
*  is the direct result of the money they gave you to get that degree.
*  Even if this is what's interesting, even if you're not doing anything
*  that has anything to do with that degree, they're like, listen, fucker,
*  we gave you that money so you could be a vet tech.
*  So you owe us.
*  You wouldn't be doing your shitty job if not for Sallie Mae.
*  I don't think they even think about it that way.
*  You don't think so? No.
*  Well, then what? Yeah.
*  Yeah, but that's part of you when you're a kid, when you're
*  your fucking frontal lobe isn't fully formed.
*  Yeah. And they force a loan on to you because you don't want to be a loser.
*  I don't feel bad for any of those kids.
*  I don't feel bad for any of them.
*  Because they could have sold subprime mortgages.
*  You know, fuck them. Listen, I went to community college and dropped out.
*  I don't feel bad for anybody who takes $200,000 out and gets a degree
*  in gender studies.
*  It's, you know, fuck them.
*  Whatever. Pay it or don't pay.
*  Gender studies, I hear you. Yeah.
*  But the thing is, like, the reason why they're doing it in the first place
*  is because they don't want to be a loser.
*  And then they get strapped down with this insane amount of debt.
*  That's true. That turns them into a loser.
*  Well, a lot of them aren't losers.
*  A lot of them are just paying back something.
*  And it's annoying. Right.
*  Dude, there's people that are getting their social security docked.
*  Yeah. And there's one here.
*  People I've heard of selling blood to pay it back.
*  It is bad. But I don't think the majority of them are in that position.
*  But here's the thing.
*  If you buy other things and you go bankrupt, you don't have to pay it back.
*  Right. But you have to pay back your student loans no matter what.
*  So my advice to those people is to pay the student loans
*  and then fuck everything else.
*  You know, I mean, or don't get a student loan or don't get a student loan.
*  Just the fact that it operates under a different rule.
*  And it's the one thing that seems not mandatory, but really, really, really enforced.
*  I mean, it's a thing that's like encouraged to the extreme.
*  Go to college, get a degree.
*  Well, don't you think that's changing?
*  Don't you think people are going to start to realize that like college in and of itself
*  without a very specific goal is probably.
*  And the reason that the student loans are this expensive is because the government backs them.
*  So that's the whole reason they're expensive, because the government guarantees them.
*  It's the same reason that a lot of health care is expensive.
*  It's like companies know a percentage of it is going to be paid by the government.
*  It's guaranteed.
*  So I think you just got to kind of decouple the government from a lot of these schools.
*  And then schools are like, OK, we can't charge 40 grand a year because no one will pay it.
*  Well, what I'm hoping is that it's going to be like like my kids right now are in virtual school.
*  Interesting. They're home.
*  Yeah, they're sitting in front of the computer and the teacher gives them examples
*  and they talk about things. The teacher can see them in little windows.
*  Also, the case is like is it like Zoom?
*  It's Zoom. Everything's on Zoom.
*  Our whole life is on Zoom.
*  The teacher can click on each individual person, see them full screen and ask them about stuff.
*  The kids can talk about it.
*  They're in front. It's real.
*  It's real weird, man, because here's the thing.
*  You know, if you're paying whatever the fuck you're paying for
*  what is a say if you're going to a real going to Yale, what does that cost a year?
*  70 grand, 60 grand, something very expensive.
*  A lot of these courses are available right now online.
*  You could just take a Yale course.
*  Well, I know MIT has. Yeah.
*  Didn't Lex Friedman talk about that, that the courses are all available online for free.
*  Interesting. So you can go there in person, but that seems so retro.
*  Yeah. Why do you have to go to a physical place?
*  I guess it's a good social experience.
*  People don't have people can't watch their kids.
*  Right. That's the big problem. It's really child care.
*  Like if you look at what schools are, it's a way to get your kid out of your hair for eight or 10 hours a day,
*  because most people have to go to work.
*  They don't have any. They don't have.
*  They can't afford to pay somebody to watch their kids.
*  What do you mean? You mean school school for little kids?
*  Yeah, for little kids. Yeah.
*  Or even in high school.
*  Well, there's a little bit of that, but it's a lot that they learn.
*  People need structured environments.
*  They learn socially.
*  Yes, that's true too.
*  It's very important for them.
*  It's not just structured environment.
*  It's also experiencing being around people and learning how to interact with them.
*  The weirdest motherfuckers I've ever been around were homeschooled.
*  Yeah, homeschooling is interesting.
*  Dude, I know a guy who is homeschooled and he's so fucking awkward and he's in his 30s.
*  He's just so he doesn't know how to hang.
*  He can't hang. He never learned how to hang.
*  No one's ever fucked with him.
*  He doesn't know.
*  He doesn't know how to deal with people jabbing him and just fucking around with him.
*  He's like, he doesn't get it.
*  Is he mentally ill?
*  No, he's a smart guy in terms of like he can rattle off facts.
*  Why did his parents homeschool him?
*  Religion. That's that's part of it.
*  It's a lot of it, man.
*  Most of them deep, real Christian stuff.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Anti-vax to a lot of weird shit.
*  The whole deal.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Apple cider vinegar. It's going to cure everything.
*  We're going to trust Bill and Melinda Gates.
*  You know, what the vaccines?
*  I mean, they're going all over the third world, sticking a needle in anything.
*  I mean, those who are they are they are.
*  It's a fact they're trying to use short.
*  Listen, they try to help people if it works. Pause. Pause.
*  What what do you think would be their motive?
*  First of all, Bill Gates literally has 90 billion dollars.
*  He's trying to do good things with his money and trying to use his money for philanthropy.
*  Sure. Yeah. But hold on.
*  The idea that are these fucking crackpot conspiracy theories
*  you have that Bill Gates is the Antichrist because he wants to get people
*  inoculated from vaccines with vaccines and viruses
*  that he's somehow another trying to control people.
*  Bill Gates has everything. Yeah.
*  He doesn't need anything. I agree.
*  He's not trying to get anything more.
*  He's making no attempts to control markets, no attempts to get to like
*  a thousand billion dollars. 100 percent.
*  He's not doing that.
*  But he's using his foundation to try to to help people
*  get get healthy, help people get Internet, help people get running water.
*  But they have. I mean, listen, they've done things in the third world
*  like they've they've introduced certain vaccines and stuff
*  that have had adverse health consequences for people.
*  Like what?
*  This is I mean, you can look it up.
*  But this is literally happened.
*  I mean, they've been involved with things where it's like when you say something
*  like that, you don't want to get sued by the richest man in the world.
*  And you're going to. He's coming after you right now.
*  I will. I will.
*  I will gladly get in a high profile legal battle with Bill Gates right now.
*  About vaccines.
*  What do you think about vaccines?
*  No, I think they're fine for the most part.
*  But if he wants to sue me because it's something I said on a podcast, let's go.
*  Well, it could only help my career.
*  He did know can't know he went crippling.
*  You went to listen.
*  I don't research these companies, but I know for a fact that, you know,
*  he's been involved in vaccine things that did not go well.
*  Where did you read this? I read it.
*  Because the planet dot com. No, no, I read it.
*  This is this is a fact.
*  This is a reality. You can't just listen.
*  People have issues with vaccines.
*  When you're saying it's a fact, you have to be able to reference.
*  I don't know. If you don't, you don't really have enough information to say.
*  It's a fact.
*  Well, it's something that's been reported and it's been credibly reported.
*  Who? I mean, see what I'm saying?
*  No, it's been credibly reported.
*  Gates Foundation accused of dangerously skewing aid priorities
*  by promoting corporate globalization.
*  The back of that photo. They don't look.
*  What does that mean?
*  I mean, that's not what we're asking.
*  We're talking about adverse reactions to vaccines.
*  Yeah, Jamie. But but say that.
*  But let me see that article title again.
*  What a bizarre title.
*  Look at this accused of click on it, please.
*  Dangerously skewing aid priorities by promoting corporate globalization.
*  What does that mean?
*  Because everything's so many quotes around everything.
*  Everything's in one umbrella, right?
*  Like his company, his his his health initiatives.
*  All of these things work together.
*  And that, you know, you have to trust that everybody's motives are pure.
*  I don't think he's trying to depopulate the world.
*  But, you know, these people stand to make lots and lots of money
*  if people adopt certain vaccines, right?
*  Or certain things that are, you know, maybe medically advantageous, maybe not.
*  Maybe necessary, maybe not.
*  There's definitely an issue when money's involved with any sort of treatment.
*  Yeah. And this is one of the issues that a lot of the conspiracy theorists
*  bring up when it comes to ventilators, that a hospital gets X amount
*  if someone gets brought into intensive care and then they get Y amount
*  if they're put on a ventilator.
*  So they're saying, well, there's a motivation to put people on ventilators.
*  Yeah, perhaps.
*  I would hope never.
*  But there have been cases of people doing surgery on people that didn't need it.
*  There have been cases of people doing things to people and treatments on people
*  where it wasn't necessary to provide, you know, something.
*  So they wanted to make money and they do things to people
*  just to make money, not to make them better. That has happened.
*  I think there was something in India, if you look at Bill Gates, India.
*  But I think I'm vaccines.
*  Yeah. I mean, listen, there is something I'm not making a stop.
*  I understand. But do you understand what I'm saying?
*  That you're saying something as a fact and you have literally no data.
*  I have the I have the data.
*  I just can't recall the exact name of it.
*  That doesn't mean it didn't happen.
*  But you don't know if it happened.
*  If you can't, I didn't go and investigate it in India.
*  Data. Well, here we go.
*  Controversial vaccine. Why is it normally?
*  Thank you. Under fire from critics in India.
*  Well, let's read it.
*  Funded to entities that have played a key role in immunization program
*  and are both under fire for conflict of interest.
*  OK, it doesn't mean adverse reactions to vaccines.
*  2009, several schools for tribal children.
*  Jesus Christ. How weird is that?
*  Say those names.
*  The Kamaman, Kamam, Kamam district.
*  Yeah, we'll just get that in Telangana.
*  Tell Telangana.
*  Then a part of undivided Andhra Pradesh became sites
*  for observational studies for a cervical cancer vaccine
*  that was administered to thousands of girls.
*  So it's an HPV disease.
*  That's a dangerous vaccine.
*  That's a dangerous vaccine.
*  Oh, these girls are whores. OK, forget it. Sorry.
*  No, the vaccine is dangerous.
*  That HPV, there's people have had adverse reaction to that,
*  like a high number.
*  The girls were administered by the with
*  administered the human papilloma virus vaccine in three rounds that
*  that year under the supervision of state health department officials.
*  The vaccine used was Gardasil manufactured by Merck.
*  Yeah, months later, many girls started falling ill.
*  And by 2010, five of them died.
*  Yeah, that's that is a I get it.
*  That's a controversial vaccine period.
*  I'm just saying it's good.
*  But it's one of those ones where there's a high number of adverse reactions.
*  Estimated 14000 children studying in schools meant for tribal children
*  were also vaccinated with another banned brand of HPV vaccine.
*  Cervarix Cervarix.
*  I like when they're like on the nose like that.
*  Oh, is it cervical cancer?
*  Yeah, we'll call it Cervarix.
*  Cervarix manufactured by GSK.
*  Earlier in the week, the Associated Press reported that scores of teenage girls
*  were hospitalized in a small town north in northern Columbia
*  with symptoms that parents suspected could be adverse adverse reaction to Gardasil.
*  So some people died from this vaccine.
*  But is it Google HPV vaccine?
*  Dangerous reactions, because I I've read that there is a certain percentage,
*  whether it's, you know, one time, I just think you have to look into it
*  when there's a guy, some people get when anyone stands to make billions of dollars
*  and institute something that's going to be very widely accepted
*  as now necessary for life.
*  You know, you have to ask questions about it.
*  According to HPV vaccine manufacturers, the most common adverse reactions
*  to Gardasil include include pain, swelling, redness, stinging, bruising,
*  bleeding of the injection site and headache, fever, nausea, diarrhea,
*  abdominal pain, and it keeps going.
*  It's not that bad.
*  I'm not saying that he's doing something inherently wrong,
*  but you have to watch people like that.
*  The fact that nobody knows, like nobody knows this.
*  You know, this is not a well-known thing.
*  I understand. But the idea that this is how he wants to make his money
*  by vaccinating people, there's a reason why he's doing that.
*  That's increasingly run by billionaires
*  who tell us what is and isn't necessary and how things are going to be. Right.
*  That's true. Whether they're in tech, whether they're in health, whatever they are.
*  These are billionaires.
*  Generally, they give these TED talks and stuff like that.
*  People don't pay attention to what they're doing.
*  They influence the political system in ways that we have
*  in ways that we know about and don't know about.
*  And you've got to watch these people.
*  I don't know Bill Gates.
*  OK, hold on. I have no idea what he wants.
*  Now we're talking about a totally different thing.
*  And I agree with you.
*  See, the thing is, before 2000, let's say 2000,
*  no one had any inkling whatsoever that social media was going to have an impact
*  on political realms, on the way, you know, just language.
*  What sort of discourse was allowed, what wasn't allowed?
*  No one ever thought that this was going to be an impact
*  and that these companies would literally earn billions of dollars
*  by selling your data, meaning what are you interested in?
*  What are you clicking on? What are you going to?
*  And that's what that's what they're getting their money from.
*  This is a great podcast that Sam Harris put out.
*  I wish I could remember the guest.
*  But he was talking about how we didn't know that our data
*  in terms of our search history, the stuff that we go to,
*  where we travel to with Google Maps, we didn't know that that data was a commodity.
*  So we signed off on one of the most valuable commodities in the world.
*  I think it's bigger than oil.
*  It's gigantic. Yeah.
*  And these companies, not only do they gather up this commodity,
*  but then they use their influence to to influence social aspects of our culture.
*  The way we communicate what's allowed, what's not allowed.
*  And that's that's squirrely because these people are a lot of more socially inept.
*  I mean, all this stuff you were talking about at the beginning,
*  when you say when they were going to come to you and they're going to say,
*  you need a card, you need this, you need that.
*  The free flow of travel, how you're allowed to travel around the country and the world.
*  A lot of these people, whether it's Gates or whoever,
*  are going to have a huge input in those laws that are made.
*  And they're going to think they're doing it for a good reason.
*  Of course. And that everybody does everything because they think they're doing it for a good reason.
*  Not necessarily. You know, well, a lot of people do.
*  Some people. I bought my house because I believed it was going to work.
*  I bought it because I believed in homeownership.
*  The point is that I just think you have to look into this.
*  It's not my job to have every fact before I speak.
*  But it's not my job.
*  When you talk about Bill Gates and vaccines and things along those lines, you probably should.
*  If Bill Gates wants to tweet at me and educate me later,
*  action to the real fear, the real fear is that they're practicing
*  with these vaccines on poor people.
*  That's what people are terrified of.
*  That's what they're doing.
*  They're doing it. They call the school a tribal girls school.
*  I know tribal tribal girls school.
*  What kind of I mean, it's crazy.
*  Native Americans.
*  I mean, Bill Gates wouldn't be doing that in Bel Air or Beverly Hills.
*  You should. You know, I agree.
*  Grab kids. Start grabbing those tick tockers and fucking put needles in their face.
*  Grab those little Beverly Hills kids.
*  I don't private schools.
*  I walk around every day.
*  Those little pieces of shit.
*  Give me a fucking look because they know I shouldn't be there, but it's close to my house.
*  We have to walk.
*  We have to walk and get air and just see other people.
*  Beverly Hills is so weird because anybody could just drive through it.
*  I know it's not blocked off.
*  I know, but I like that.
*  But you know, York's like that.
*  But you'll drive by these houses that are worth 30 million dollars.
*  Yeah. Look at that. Yeah.
*  It's right there. It's 30 million dollars. I know.
*  I could throw a rock.
*  Yeah, but you know what it is?
*  Gated communities ruin the fun for people like me
*  that want to just appreciate other people's wealth.
*  You say that until you get rich.
*  Why can't I know once you get rich, you'll be living right next door to me.
*  I am going to come over and ask for sugar if I'm allowed.
*  It's still allow me, by the way.
*  You might have to you might have to vouch for me with the condo board.
*  I'll call. I'll talk to the people.
*  Whatever the people.
*  I'll talk to the people.
*  But here's the deal.
*  I want to go out and get it.
*  When I was a little kid, we would smoke pot.
*  We drive around these big areas and we get inspired
*  and we look at big houses and mansions.
*  We get inspired.
*  How'd that work out for you?
*  None of us succeeded.
*  The point is, it's nice to see.
*  It's nice to see Christmas lights on a big mansion.
*  You shouldn't be stopped at a gate.
*  Well, what if you're a fucking psychopath?
*  Well, that's a problem.
*  Yeah, that's a problem.
*  I don't want to have to wait in the front of my house with a gun.
*  You're famous. It's different.
*  Rich people. No one's coming to kill regular rich people.
*  Do you know what you hear?
*  What happened with Sebastian's cousin who has the exact same name as him?
*  Listen, I don't want to say.
*  Do you know what happened?
*  Yeah, but is that is that I talked to Sebastian is a totally random.
*  Some guy, it's so weird.
*  Two guys came to his house.
*  They they rang the doorbell with masks on.
*  Yeah. Fucking covid masks.
*  OK, he opened the door and they rushed the house.
*  But his cousin knows how to fight.
*  So his cousin beat the fuck out of one of you.
*  You wash it. I'll send you the doorbell video footage of it.
*  Beats the fuck out of one of them in the front of the house,
*  goes inside and kills the other guy.
*  Crazy, dude. You think you're a lot of gun.
*  The guy had a big how it's just a nice house.
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
*  The guy had they had duct tape.
*  They had tasers. They had all kinds of shit.
*  They were planning on home invading and killing some people.
*  Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
*  Just random in the middle of the day, by the way.
*  You got to have. Well, yeah, you got to have guns and locks.
*  Answer the doorbell because he thought it was his gardener coming back
*  because the gardener was there and then the doorbell rang
*  and he assumed it was his gardener coming back. Right.
*  And the guy has the same name as Sebastian.
*  But if we yeah, but then we'll put gates everywhere.
*  Then everyone's going to have a gate.
*  I mean, it's just one.
*  I mean, that's an example.
*  Well, I'm just saying that sometimes people's houses get broken into.
*  And this is one thing that you have to think about, really think about.
*  Yeah. With this economy going into the fucking toilet, it's going to be bad.
*  It's going to be bad. 30 percent.
*  They said 60 million people filed unemployment claims.
*  It's going to get rough.
*  Well, also, the businesses hasn't even haven't even shut down yet.
*  Correct. The businesses that can't get out of this haven't even realized
*  they can't get out of this yet. Right.
*  Some of them have.
*  But I think a large percentage of them are still trying to keep it together.
*  Yeah, we don't know.
*  So when they go under, all the people that were working for them go under.
*  It's going to be very bad.
*  I have I have an apartment on the first floor with a don't tell anybody.
*  Sliding glass door.
*  I want I want people to come in and kill me.
*  I want people to kill me. Why?
*  No, I'm kidding. I want them to just come in and Bill Gates is going to kill you
*  and do a podcast, going to stick HIV vaccine.
*  Listen, I have a concern for the tribal girls in India.
*  I apologize. I'm sorry about that.
*  I'm sorry. I haven't forgotten the tribal women in India who know what's
*  being for province.
*  Except me, Guwahata.
*  And these are good girls.
*  And yes, they're whores.
*  And yes, they have HPV. Right.
*  Well, they're just keeping them from getting it from dirty people like you.
*  I support tribal whores.
*  The point is this.
*  I was worried about
*  getting robbed as anyone because desperate criminals will rob me.
*  Good criminals will rob you or try.
*  Desperate people will rob me.
*  Well, people are going to rob because they need money.
*  I mean, we're in a weird place where the look.
*  If you're in Brazil, Brazil is a good example.
*  You have a lot of haves and a lot of have nots.
*  And if when you go there, one of the things you see is barbed wire
*  around people's houses and long, like tall fences and walls.
*  And then a barbed wire on top of it.
*  And then above that, in the favelas, you see houses with no windows and dirt floors.
*  It's crazy. Wow.
*  And they come down from the favelas, rob the rich people and go back up.
*  And the economy crashes.
*  The crime rises radically.
*  So Brazil was doing really well for a while and then went to shit.
*  And so they're in a bad place now.
*  And the crime has really ridden to the point. I should get a gun.
*  My oh, yeah, for sure.
*  But my jujitsu instructor won't even go.
*  He's from Rio. He won't even go back to Rio.
*  He's really he's like, it's too dangerous.
*  It's too dangerous. My friend.
*  Yeah. They'll kidnap.
*  If they know you're American or live here, they might kidnap you.
*  Try to get money.
*  Well, when I used to do the UFC down there, it was fine.
*  It hadn't gotten that bad yet.
*  But Brazil's great.
*  There's a lot of great things in Brazil.
*  The food there is fantastic.
*  You ever had Brazilian barbecues?
*  The Brazilian steak houses and all that. It's great.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's in the fucking views.
*  It's like it's something we're sliding into that.
*  Do you think there's a chance America is sliding into one of those countries
*  where is this economic collapse going to be too much?
*  Do you think? You know, I don't know.
*  No one knows.
*  This is what's interesting about this in a bad way.
*  Yeah. It's like, hmm, who knows, man?
*  Who knows? You know, it's all weird.
*  It's all weird because we're in uncharted territory.
*  We've never in the history of this country had a month
*  where everybody was locked down and stayed inside.
*  There was some lockdowns, apparently, in 1918 during the Spanish flu.
*  But that was, you know, it's hard to know what the difference was
*  between then and, you know, when they were locked down, whether they wore masks.
*  You know, I'd have to go back.
*  And I know at least for the last 100 years, there's been nothing like this.
*  So we don't really know what the fuck we're talking about.
*  We also don't know what's going to happen when they when they fling open
*  the barn doors and say quarantine's over.
*  Sure. Our people going to go out.
*  Yeah. In China, people are catching it again.
*  I mean, it's they're having second waves.
*  Yeah. Wow.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  I mean, I tend to think that people, you know, they did a study in Ohio.
*  Ohio didn't have an I have the facts.
*  Ohio didn't have
*  Ohio. You could look it up.
*  They didn't officially close restaurants to the 25th.
*  But for the 10 days prior to that, 10 to 15 days prior foot traffic had dropped 50 percent.
*  So people didn't need an order or a law saying not to go out.
*  They were scared. They were scared.
*  I went out on the 14th.
*  I went on the 14th.
*  I ate at this restaurant in Venice, Felix, my favorite restaurant.
*  Yeah. And it was still pretty crowded.
*  It was fine. Yeah. My wife really does.
*  Oh, this is OK.
*  I'm trying to think.
*  One of the one of the last places I was in was a comedy store on that Monday night.
*  And I did an O.R. spot and I was making fun of the virus.
*  I was making fun of it.
*  I said that like I was like, oh, there was an Asian lady on my plane.
*  She coughed. We all beat the shit out of her.
*  And everyone was laughing.
*  And it was fun. Sounds racist.
*  And it was. Well, it was.
*  And it was funny.
*  And those are often they dovetail.
*  They dovetail. They dovetail.
*  That's what it is. You know, isms are funny.
*  You know. Yeah.
*  And then and then I got off stage and the Asians loved it.
*  They were laughing. We all laughed because nobody thought this was going to happen.
*  Well, also, nobody thought it was going to be.
*  You really beat the fuck out of anybody.
*  Was obviously joking around.
*  Of course, that's what comedy is.
*  So they, you know, people in the room know that, you know, if somebody
*  written about it, they would have been like, this is inappropriate.
*  Well, that following Friday, I was supposed to do a show in the main room.
*  No, not Friday, Thursday.
*  And they called me up and said, we are going to shut down the main room.
*  I was supposed to two shows.
*  We shut down the main room and cancel your shows.
*  And we're only going to open the O.R.
*  because the governor has asked that groups of more than 200 people.
*  Yeah. Should be banned.
*  Such a weird arbitrary number.
*  But they were just trying to do anything.
*  They can think about this when you talk about how Trump should have known better.
*  This was our own governor who's very conservative now about this.
*  Not not conservative, obviously liberal, but conservative about the moves that we make.
*  And this was in the beginning of March, in the middle of March.
*  In fact, they were still saying groups of 200 people in March.
*  So this is all fucking touch and go.
*  And I don't think it's helping anybody, all this fucking pointing the finger
*  and blaming this person, blaming that person.
*  But you do have to look at a system and go, we weren't prepared.
*  Yeah, we could have been better prepared. Right.
*  We can get Trump to get rid of a pandemic team, which I get it.
*  If I had been president, I probably would have gotten rid of them, too.
*  Doctors suck. Scientists suck.
*  So Trump was like, get him out of here.
*  He did get rid of that team.
*  But was that his call?
*  Well, it's his government.
*  When you're the president, you have to do that.
*  I'm sure he signed off on it.
*  I'm hearing that there was something where they did shut down the pandemic. Yeah.
*  Office, but I don't know the facts.
*  But I do know that they reopened this.
*  They had a virus hunting organization
*  that literally their job is to hunt viruses, to find out where viruses are
*  coming from. And they just funded the shit out of them.
*  I mean, that sounds like a fun reality show.
*  Virus hunters.
*  The thing, dude, is like this is we're dealing with one version of this.
*  Yeah, this could get worse.
*  This could be a new one next year.
*  That could be another one the year.
*  It could just be a new reality, just pandemic after pandemic. Yeah.
*  Whenever civil unrest starts happening in the streets, they just go,
*  here's a new pandemic.
*  Well, the problem is number two.
*  The problem is when you get large groups of people, right,
*  you're going to have large groups of people that need food.
*  And then you have factory farming.
*  So factory farming is the cause of a lot of these pandemics.
*  And then this fucking wet market is real similar in that regard.
*  This has been a big diseases jump.
*  The vegans are kind of this is this is a decent time, right?
*  To make that point.
*  Their immune systems. Right.
*  They're making that they're making that vegan point.
*  They're not now in terms of like their cultivation.
*  No, but who's got the best point is the regenerative farming people.
*  OK, though the Joel Salatin people that have figured out a way
*  not only to sequester carbon, but actually they're taking carbon
*  out of the air and reintroducing all these ancient farming methods
*  where they're moving cows around a different plots and, you know,
*  are the wet market's factory farming now?
*  That seems pretty independent.
*  No, it's not factory farming, but it's animals in confinement
*  surrounded by other animals living in these unnatural environments.
*  That's what it is.
*  Wet markets are foul.
*  But can you avoid that when you got to feed a population like that?
*  Well, Osterholm, yeah, you can feed them bugs.
*  Osterholm had a whole he was the guy that scared the fuck out of everybody
*  when he came on my podcast, but terrified me as a whole section
*  in this book that he wrote from three years ago, from 2017 about wet markets
*  and how the next pandemic is going to come out of wet market.
*  So we got to shut up.
*  We got to try to persuade China to shut them down.
*  They're not going to.
*  You know what they did say?
*  They're taking dogs off the livestock listing like, yay.
*  You guys are doing good.
*  What about bats? Get the bats out of there.
*  But I mean, it's almost like they're throwing people a bone.
*  Like, hey, we're going to we're going to know dogs.
*  We're going to stop considering dogs livestock.
*  Like, oh, you got to know.
*  Also, they're not. They're definitely not.
*  Well, neither, you know, but they eat them.
*  Right. We pigs.
*  I don't judge them because they need to eat. Right.
*  So if I was really hungry and I had to eat a dog, I would eat a dog.
*  I mean, these are just things that we would have to do.
*  It's easy for me to say, but that's it's a lot more normal to eat a dog
*  than to do what they do in Manhattan, which is put them in strollers
*  and pretend they're children.
*  Yeah, that's a little freakier to me than a wet market is seeing
*  like two 30 year olds walking down the block with a fucking chihuahua
*  in a in a bassinet.
*  You know, yeah, of course, all over New York, dude. Really?
*  Yeah. People have like, I'm a cat mom.
*  I'm a dog mom.
*  There's dog mom stuff. Yeah, it's crazy.
*  And then they put the dogs, they dress them up, they put them in strollers
*  and they stroll them down the street.
*  That is more grotesque than a than a than a well run wet market.
*  When I see that in someone's Instagram handle dog mom, I'm like, oh, it's bad.
*  Poor child. Those are female like incels.
*  Those are the that's those are that my friend told me that.
*  And it's this kid that opened for me, Dan Carney.
*  He said those are female incels.
*  They are the people like, oh, they're the other side of the dudes
*  where they just sit at home every night and get drunk.
*  And they're like, I'm a grandma. I'm such a grandma.
*  But they're yeah, they're just the worst at comedy shows
*  because they're always offended. They're always white.
*  They're always white. They're always always white women offended.
*  They want to be part of the show.
*  They're always liberal.
*  And then after they heckle you all night, they come out
*  and they tell you how great you are.
*  They're like, you're good. You're OK.
*  It's disgusting. Yeah, it's bad. Boy.
*  There were some of them.
*  I remember I think Eliza was going to be at the store
*  and a lot of her fans were there and then, you know,
*  and then she didn't show up.
*  So then I came out.
*  So it was like a real culture shock because they're expecting like Eliza.
*  And then I walked out and like you could see like a lot
*  because the first three rows were all hot white chicks.
*  And then they looked at me like, what the fuck?
*  Where Eliza got? What is this?
*  I said something else to do, something better to do.
*  Maybe. Yeah.
*  So then they just called me in.
*  I just hopped out of an Uber.
*  And then there was a lot of disappointed,
*  a lot of disappointed Instagram models there.
*  They were not happy.
*  I came out and started yelling about the Clintons killing people.
*  They were like, this is not the show we wanted.
*  We did not want this.
*  Oh, and in the middle of all this, there's a new fucking this.
*  The lady who said that Biden did something to her now, she's saying
*  it was sexual assault. Yeah.
*  Well, they're going to they're going to if they're smart,
*  they're going to they're going to they're going to swap by now.
*  Well, here's this show is kind of a meatball,
*  but he's a better candidate than Biden.
*  But this shows the hypocrisy of liberals that they're not coming after him.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, they're just, yeah, they want him.
*  They want him to be the representative of the Democratic Party.
*  But here's the thing. They are right now.
*  They were wrong before.
*  Like, here's why they're right now and they were wrong before.
*  Anybody could come at anybody with an allegation.
*  Anybody could come at any high profile.
*  When you say believe all women, you have to live by that.
*  You got to believe Amber Heard.
*  You got to believe everybody. Yeah.
*  You got to believe everybody.
*  You seen all this Johnny Depp shit?
*  I saw a little bit of it. Yeah. Jesus Christ.
*  There's audio tapes where she's talking about hitting him. Yeah.
*  And then there's a new video where it shows his severed finger.
*  She threw a fucking vodka bottle on it.
*  She was the slice the tip of his finger off.
*  And literally, there's pictures of the finger and there's the audio recordings
*  of the doctor looking for the fingertip. They're looking for the tip.
*  They can't find the tip.
*  They're like, where's the fucking fingertip?
*  And the ringer that oh, my God, look at the blood.
*  And you can hear them talking.
*  And she's like violently sobbing in the background.
*  So they decide to give her three times whatever anti psychotic medicine
*  there are that she's on.
*  So she's on this this dose.
*  They decided to jack it up to three X, whatever the dose is.
*  But meanwhile, this is the lady that had him me too.
*  And was saying that he beat her and believe had a mark on her face.
*  Believe all women.
*  Well, that's the whole thing.
*  So the Democrats are now reaping what they've sown in the sense that
*  anybody can can approach some, you know, the press with it
*  unsubstantiated allegation about somebody who's high profile.
*  I mean, I understand that women aren't just willy nilly lying about stuff.
*  But the picture changes when there's somebody who's a politically divisive,
*  high profile figure where there is a huge incentive to knock that person off.
*  Right. There's a huge incentive, whether it's Brett Kavanaugh,
*  whether it's Joe Biden, there's a huge incentive to derail that person.
*  So I think in that instance, because I do believe that like
*  most women are not just making things up.
*  That being said, when you introduce politics,
*  there's a whole nother level.
*  It's a whole nother layer.
*  Well, for sure.
*  I mean, there's a lot of intelligence agencies could be doing this too.
*  Yeah. You know, that could. Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm not saying this woman who actually worked for Biden's campaign
*  was a foreign intelligence agent. We have no idea.
*  But what I'm saying is that for sure, men have sexually assaulted women.
*  Also, for sure, women have lied about being sexually assaulted.
*  Those two things are they they they're not mutually exclusive.
*  They go hand in hand. Right.
*  People are liars.
*  The people lie about the past.
*  100 percent. People also are delusional.
*  People are also psychotic and schizophrenic. Yeah.
*  All sorts of things are going on.
*  But this when you say believe all women, that is a crazy thing to say.
*  Believe that's like saying believe all people. Correct.
*  It's the same thing. Can't do it.
*  So what are you doing? You believe the liars, too.
*  Do you believe murderers?
*  Do you believe people that are trying to get out of jail?
*  Do you believe rapists?
*  You can't believe all people. Right.
*  You also can't believe all men.
*  Well, you also can't believe all women. That's crazy.
*  Do you believe Casey Anthony?
*  No, because I do. No, I'm kidding.
*  She's the one that I make an exception.
*  So people are humans.
*  He's like a good kid.
*  Humans are individuals and some people are fucking crazy.
*  Yeah. I mean, so he's I don't know, man.
*  But I think the bigger problem with him is he's he's is in some stage of dementia.
*  100 percent. He's unwell.
*  There's something he's unwell.
*  I say he's a folder either that or he may be just as bad.
*  He folds under pressure.
*  He's getting close to the finish line.
*  He's just bumbling all his words and choking and forgetting what he's talking about.
*  I don't think it's that. I think something's wrong because you know why there
*  it seems like it's degenerative, like it seems like it's gotten worse.
*  So that's why I think something's wrong.
*  100 percent. Yeah. Also, he's old as fuck.
*  Yeah. Also, he looks bad.
*  Right. He doesn't look like a healthy guy.
*  No. I was looking at this weird Lady Gaga thing today with him and Lady Gaga,
*  where he's talking about how no one should ever put their hand on a woman.
*  Who? And I'm watching this because I guess Lady Gaga was sexually assaulted.
*  But who the fuck is ever going to watch that and say, you know what?
*  I was going to put my hand on a woman, but now I'm not going to
*  go back to that. She looks like Hillary.
*  Go back on a story about. Oh, OK.
*  She has a Hillary haircut.
*  Oh, no. Interesting move.
*  Is that a Hillary? Yeah. Look at it.
*  Let me see it again. It's actually old.
*  It kind of looks. Yeah, it's from 2017.
*  Oh, it kind of looks a little.
*  Oh, it's just coming out now.
*  I guess people are throwing it around now.
*  What were they saying? I don't know. Nonsense.
*  But here's the thing.
*  They were saying no one should ever put their hand on a woman.
*  Of course they shouldn't. Of course.
*  But if you're thinking about hitting a woman and Joe Biden
*  is what keeps you from doing it. Like what?
*  What? I don't understand the logic.
*  I guess maybe if you're a woman who's being abused,
*  it could perhaps encourage you to go to the authorities.
*  Right. It could perhaps.
*  I mean, right. But I would imagine.
*  But by saying by him saying no man should ever put his hands on a woman.
*  Who the fuck thinks they should?
*  Who's like they disagree?
*  I mentioned just beat the fuck out of women.
*  Keep them in line.
*  Somebody somebody said once it's like when somebody goes, hey, I'm pro family.
*  It's like that's a controversial position.
*  You know, I'm pro fam. Right.
*  But all these public service announcements, all that kind of shit.
*  It's like, OK, who are you doing that for?
*  Yeah. Like who's out there going, I was about to rape.
*  But then I saw Joe Biden and he's like, don't rape much.
*  He's got a point. Yeah. Yeah. He's got.
*  That doesn't. Joe Biden.
*  I just respect him.
*  He's a statesman. Do what does it do?
*  Well, it's just that that's part of why nobody believes anything
*  and nobody trusts anybody. Right.
*  That's part of why these guys that are online,
*  are they go hard in the paint with conspiracies
*  because these are buffoons, like the people that we have
*  ruling us have been exposed as like creations. Right.
*  These people, everything they say scripted, you know, all of them are
*  are in the pocket of big business interests and like
*  and these people have been exposed.
*  So now we don't believe anything.
*  We don't believe the media.
*  The media said the Covington kids were, you know, harassing this Native American guy.
*  It turns out was completely wrong. Right.
*  It's completely the other way around.
*  So you don't believe the media and you don't believe the politicians.
*  So it's like it gives you no one to believe.
*  How much those Covington kids get?
*  They got a lot. Right. Or no, I don't know.
*  I don't know. I don't know.
*  I think it was I don't have to. I didn't look at the legal transcript.
*  I want to get one of them kids on.
*  Yeah. Well, you got to get the main one.
*  The kid who smiled. Yeah.
*  I get a smile. You can't get that.
*  That kid should get a medal of honor for his composure.
*  Yeah. He didn't do anything wrong.
*  Walks in his face and starts beating a drum.
*  Dude, we would have from a child.
*  My God, that guy.
*  I would have sold that guy a house, that Native American.
*  I would have he'd be living in a townhouse right now.
*  But yeah, I mean, but again, so that's an example of the media clearly lying,
*  not even being wrong.
*  No manufacturing news.
*  Well, they definitely distorted the fact.
*  Well, they manufactured it.
*  You also well, it was not what they said it was. Right.
*  Well, we had an image.
*  The image was a smiling kid with a MAGA hat with a Native American guy in his face.
*  From there, they extrapolated something. It didn't happen.
*  We assumed because of that image that the kid got in the face of the Native American man.
*  Well, it's their job to do some investigation and do reporting, do their due diligence.
*  They didn't do any of that.
*  So then they created this thing out of thin air where the kid approached the Native guy
*  and they were all chanting. They were doing a school chant.
*  They weren't chanting, fuck the Native Americans.
*  They were doing a school chant.
*  And the media went in there and just blew it out of proportion.
*  Well, apparently also in Washington, D.C., around that area,
*  you could buy MAGA hats everywhere. Right.
*  So it's like they have these stands set up.
*  Yeah. You know, like, kids.
*  Well, yeah, they don't know what they're doing.
*  Yeah. It's like if you're going somewhere and
*  fill in the blank, you know, right.
*  And they support. They have beads everywhere. Right. Yeah.
*  Well, this area, they have MAGA hats.
*  It's just people selling shit. Yeah.
*  And so they went over and they bought these hats because they're dorks.
*  Because they're. Yeah.
*  Meanwhile, you and I would have probably done the same thing.
*  We were saying we would have absolutely done the same thing.
*  Yeah. If we thought it was controversial to wear a MAGA hat,
*  we would probably wear MAGA hats. Absolutely.
*  Yeah. Especially if you're 16, you don't know what the fuck you're doing.
*  Well, they also listen. They're allowed to support the president.
*  They're from Kentucky. They go to some Christian school.
*  It's probably wacky, but they went for some pro-life march.
*  That's what it was. Right. It was a pro-life march.
*  And they show up to this thing.
*  And it's just it's an indication was that because sometimes I'll be on Twitter
*  and I'll get really frustrated because people are like, this virus is fake.
*  And who you know, how do you believe CNN?
*  And I'm like, OK, guys, listen, the thing's not fake.
*  You know, but then the reality is they've seen so many instances
*  of the media either embellishing or manufacturing.
*  It's hard to get mad at people that are that are suspicious.
*  It's hard to get mad when the Jeffrey Epstein story goes away
*  and no one cares anymore that the biggest political scandal of our lifetime goes away.
*  When no one cares about any of that anymore, people get very,
*  you know, they get very cynical about all the information that's out there.
*  And I go to war, conspiracy people all the time because they're like, no,
*  this is, you know, but the reality is I can't fault them for believing in this stuff
*  because there's so much out there.
*  You know, we're in the no man's land of logic.
*  Well, it's also when people have these preconceived notions
*  that they're clinging to despite the evidence.
*  You know, like whether it's either either the Seth Rich murder,
*  like nothing to see here, nothing to see here. Right.
*  No, it's not not like a guy was working for the DNC.
*  Yeah. And a guy who gave information, of course, WikiLeaks,
*  gave information to WikiLeaks and was shot and killed with.
*  Kept they didn't touch his wallet or credit cards.
*  Yeah. Or his cell phone. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, nothing to see here.
*  Well, it's just when you when you dismiss all conspiracies,
*  it's the same thing as believing all conspiracies.
*  When you dismiss ones that are like, hmm, well, you know, and the anybody
*  it got to the Jeffrey Epstein one where everybody was like,
*  everybody was like, wait, what? Yeah.
*  That was one slow people down.
*  I mean, the fucking physical evidence that Michael Padden report
*  where he said this is not consistent with someone hanging.
*  Yes, it's consistent with someone getting strangled from the back.
*  Yeah. That's why when I, you know, with the QAnon stuff with Eddie or Sam
*  or any of those people, it's like I some of it is probably true.
*  There are like a lot of like very powerful pedophiles doing horrible things.
*  But then from there, they've extrapolated it to go into this whole story,
*  which I don't know if it doesn't seem like it's true. There's no evidence.
*  Well, I don't know the QAnon story, but I know that every time
*  someone starts talking about it, my eyes glaze over and I move away.
*  Well, because it's like religion. You got to trust.
*  It's all they all say, trust the plan.
*  So they say that there's there's these secret people within
*  in the intelligence community that are giving us information.
*  And then with that information, we got to piece together what's really going on.
*  But it's all about these child pornography or child pedophilia.
*  It's all about these things which do listen, they 100 percent exist.
*  The problem is these people believe that Trump is fighting them
*  in a shadow intelligence war. I don't know if that's the case. Right.
*  I don't know if that's the case.
*  It doesn't seem to be sweet if it was.
*  How does he have the time?
*  If you're right, I'm sorry.
*  How does he have the time to shut down the borders, get the ventilators, get them?
*  Well, that's what they believe.
*  They believe the virus was a cover to go arrest all the pedophiles
*  and that they they were freeing kids that were kept in tunnels.
*  I don't know why billionaires need to keep kids in tunnels.
*  But again, you got to take them at their word.
*  Oh, my God, I need to spark a joint.
*  I can't hear you anymore. You know, you hurt my head.
*  All I did was come on the show, trying to advocate for girls in India
*  and protect them from tribal protect tribal girls from the Bill Gates needle.
*  And I'm attacked.
*  And Joe comes, where are your facts?
*  How offensive is that?
*  Where are my facts?
*  How insane is it that I need to know my facts before I make a statement
*  on a show that's being watched by millions of people?
*  Yeah, especially with the QAnon stuff.
*  It's 2020. The world's over.
*  I'm going to say what I feel is right.
*  I'm going to say what I want to say.
*  It doesn't matter anymore.
*  Give me a prediction.
*  Twenty twenty one, mid twenty twenty one, August of twenty twenty one.
*  Trump's winning again.
*  That's that's not even that doesn't even count.
*  You know, a friend of mine sent me this, and it's really kind of an interesting theory.
*  He said, if you look at whenever there's a an incumbent
*  that's running for reelection, the Democrats always throw someone lame against him.
*  Interesting. Makes you think it's a uniparty.
*  Makes you think it's not real.
*  Well, it's also that they don't want to waste anybody.
*  Well, it's also like think about.
*  Yeah. Buddha, judge and Klobuchar.
*  They've got real potential,
*  especially with a couple of years of seasoning.
*  Yeah, right. Sure.
*  If if if Buddha, judge can, you know, he was the mayor.
*  He abandoned that position because it wasn't worthy of him. Right.
*  And then he moved on. Right.
*  Well, the CIA told him it was time to run for president.
*  Whatever. Is that what happened? Absolutely.
*  How do you know that?
*  He one of his mentors is a guy named Doug Something.
*  And Pete Buddha, judge was, you know, he was in the military,
*  but he barely did anything.
*  He's always posing with his rifle. It's strange.
*  And again, he's just listen.
*  Do you think he's really gay?
*  Yes, probably. Maybe not. He's in the CIA.
*  He seems gay, though.
*  But he also seems like he's a CIA.
*  You have to ask yourself when the biggest companies in the world
*  and the biggest billionaires start lining up behind the mayor of a small
*  Indiana town, something's going on. Yeah.
*  Same thing when it was the governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton.
*  Something's going on.
*  I have a friend who is pretty deep in that world.
*  Yes. Deeply distrust that guy. Of course.
*  He's like, I do not trust a word out of that guy's mouth.
*  You know what somebody said to me once? You're going to love this quote.
*  He said the dangerous people aren't the guys that were born rich.
*  The danger he goes, they are dangerous because the most dangerous people
*  are the guys like Buddha, judge who will do anything.
*  They come from outside and he goes, they're just it's raw ambition.
*  They'll do anything to get where they're going.
*  Those people are more terrifying than the Kennedys or Bush's who were born,
*  you know, and those families are murderers.
*  And that's where Epstein used to come along.
*  Come on, the lowly express.
*  Come on in.
*  You're going to get in with all the Thai people.
*  Jeffrey Epstein, associate,
*  because same Maxwell sues his estate and good for her because she lost in seeking
*  to recoup legal fees to defend herself against Epstein related allegations.
*  Oh, Jesus. Yeah.
*  So she didn't know anything about it. Of course not.
*  How could she know anything? She was with him 24 seven.
*  She was taking advantage. And I believe her.
*  Believe all women. I believe her.
*  I believe just slain.
*  She's a woman. Is she?
*  She's probably in Israel.
*  Oh, a complaint filed to Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
*  Oh, that's where she is.
*  I think she's in the Virgin Islands.
*  She's being taken care of by the Mossad. You think so?
*  Yeah. It was a Mossad op. Supposedly. Right. Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't have a exact on that, but I I trust my sources.
*  Yeah. You have sources. I have.
*  So I told you some stuff about that. Of course. Crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  Is Dana White going to buy that island and do fights on it?
*  Do. Yeah. Fights are going to be on fuck island.
*  They're all going to they're all going to take place after midnight.
*  The way into the front of that temple.
*  Yeah. We're going to hang a goat by its ankles.
*  Yeah. And slice its neck.
*  Yeah. Soon we're going to have to eat it in this country.
*  We're going to symbolize the start of the proceedings.
*  It's crazy, man.
*  But I think we're in this weird dystopian future where you don't know what to believe.
*  Yeah. Well, we're we're definitely there.
*  We're definitely there.
*  And that's going to usher in mind control by virtue of software
*  that allows you to read each other's thoughts.
*  Wow. That's what's going to.
*  There's only one way to tell for sure.
*  We all take the implant, put it on the side of our head.
*  Can't go outside. Where's your implant?
*  Yeah. They're going to put biochips under your skin.
*  They're going to do all that.
*  Cool headbands, you know.
*  Yeah. Cool headbands that you wear that like they're stylish.
*  It's also like at a certain point, maybe that's just what we have to do,
*  because, you know, what else are we doing in this country?
*  Going to buffets and, you know, eating fried chicken and selling each other
*  hand grenades and taking cruises. I mean, think of phones.
*  Think of phones. Right.
*  I mean, how often do you see people walking around
*  and they just have this thing in their hand where they go?
*  And we just think of it as no big deal.
*  It's going to be in your head soon.
*  Yeah. But if you go but go back 25 years ago, that was not the case.
*  You didn't see people walking around with phones. Right.
*  And walk everywhere with a phone in their hand. No.
*  But now it's a normal part of life.
*  Yeah. A normal part of life will be you're going to wear this thing.
*  It's going to be on the side of your head.
*  And if you're lying, it'll be red.
*  That's creepy, because I love to lie.
*  What do you lie about?
*  I mean, every time. Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
*  It's so funny. So funny.
*  So funny. So good.
*  It's so good. Yeah.
*  So good. We all lie. You gotta lie.
*  A little bit. If you're not lying, you're wasting.
*  If I'm not lying, it means I don't care.
*  Or you're wasting a lot of time.
*  I didn't show up to Dr. Drew once.
*  I didn't. I totally forgot.
*  I went to the beach. Idiot. Right.
*  I was at the Trump Golf Course at Palos Verdes.
*  I get an email from the booker of your mom's house.
*  And they said, are you finding parking? OK. I panicked.
*  I didn't know what to do.
*  So I should forget. Totally. Totally forgot.
*  Totally forgot.
*  They didn't send a reminder, which they don't have to.
*  I'm an adult. Totally forgot. Was in the Trump.
*  So I said, OK, well, Trump.
*  So I said, listen, my mother is sick.
*  She's on her deathbed. I have to fly.
*  Do you know about this lie? Yeah, I've told it.
*  I talked about it on Segerisha.
*  But I said, I said, my mother's on her deathbed.
*  I have to fly to New York. I'm so sorry.
*  Ten minutes later, I realize there's a picture of me on Instagram
*  at the beach in, you know, Manhattan Beach.
*  But why did I lie? Because I cared.
*  I was embarrassed that I didn't go.
*  So the lie was because I cared.
*  If I didn't lie, if I just email them and went, oh, sorry, fuck.
*  Sorry, dude. Forgot. That would mean I didn't care.
*  Well, I just because you mean you're a comic and you forget about things.
*  I know. But sometimes you got to lie to to to to show people you care about them.
*  Hmm. Interesting.
*  What's a good way to think about it?
*  Interesting perspective. It's a pretty good way to think about it.
*  That's the way the government thinks.
*  They're like, we lie about you to prove that we care.
*  Really? Yeah, guaranteed. Yeah.
*  They go, people can't know this. They cannot handle the truth.
*  Like what? Anything. Aliens. All of it.
*  Have you read that book, Chaos, about Manson, the Manson family?
*  I've read some of it. Yeah. Fitzsimmons is his buddy.
*  Yeah. It's very interesting.
*  On Thursday. It's going to be interesting.
*  Well, all of that stuff in the CIA.
*  What was going on in Laurel Canyon is crazy.
*  There was this guy who wrote a book, Dave McGowan, and he wrote a book
*  called Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon.
*  And it's all about this weird overlap between like this burgeoning music scene
*  and a lot of like intelligence things.
*  And LSD, Timothy Leary, all these things that were happening
*  in the Haight-Ashbury and Laurel Canyon, like where they were, you know,
*  you know, running operations, experimenting these mind control drugs
*  on all these different people and like cozying up to weird cults.
*  And it was very strange.
*  That's what the book's about. Yeah.
*  I'm in chapter eight now. It's really wild.
*  It keeps getting crazier and crazier.
*  Well, once they get deeper and deeper into the CIA mind control ops.
*  M.K. And what what they were actually doing and what they were allowing.
*  They were like literally letting people free.
*  They were telling people at one of the murder trials to never bring up
*  Charles Manson, don't talk about it.
*  He was the prosecuting judge or the judge, rather, was being told
*  to ignore evidence about Manson.
*  Don't bring up the prosecuting attorney.
*  Don't bring up Manson.
*  They were being told to not bring up Manson because the CIA was studying
*  human behavior and in order to do that, they had to get in bed with some very,
*  you know, nefarious characters, people that were not just studying behavior.
*  They were trying to get rid of the hippies.
*  They were trying to disband the hippies and they were trying to use people
*  like the Manson family to attack people that were in black rights movements
*  and civil rights movements.
*  They're trying to destabilize a lot of the anti-war opposition groups.
*  Crazy. They were also trying to like create an insuring candidate,
*  see if they could wipe somebody's mind clean and control them.
*  You know, a lot of those mind control experiments went went back to,
*  you know, Operation Paperclip, where you had, you know, scientists
*  that were in Germany doing these really harrowing experiments on people.
*  We brought them all to America after this, and they continued
*  a lot of those experiments here.
*  Yeah, we've talked about Operation Paperclip.
*  Too much. And so the whole thing is like, did it ever stop?
*  That's the interesting question.
*  Of course. Did it ever stop or is it still going on right now?
*  Why would they stop? Well, why? Of course, why would it stop?
*  Why would they? I mean, when you go to Operation Northwoods
*  and you find out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had already signed a document
*  saying that they're down with blowing up a jet airliner and blaming it on Cuba,
*  blowing up a boat, using Cuban friendlies, arming them to attack Guantanamo Bay.
*  It's crazy. They're like, if we could do this in 1960s,
*  if they were doing that in the early 1960s.
*  Yeah. What? Everything evolves, right?
*  Everything evolves. Yeah.
*  Like, why wouldn't that evolve?
*  It's interesting. And you wonder what are, you know, are the are some of the
*  are these are apps, you know, the new mind control?
*  Like, do they look at an app and see the way people are behaving?
*  Well, that's why the government's telling you to get off of TikTok.
*  Right. And Google won't allow people to have TikTok on their phones.
*  It's a Chinese. Yeah. There's other things.
*  Zoom. They're saying Google saying don't don't have Zoom on your computer
*  if you work at Google. Interesting.
*  Well, because Zoom collects, I think, a lot of data from your phone
*  or something like that. Like it collects everything.
*  I don't understand.
*  There's still compromised.
*  There's there's certain security problems with the application.
*  And the president of the company that created it said they fucked up.
*  The CEO said they fucked up, that there's been some fuck ups.
*  I just don't think that they expected this many people to start using it
*  that quickly. And I think because it's scaled up because of the pandemic,
*  everybody was like, what the fuck? I didn't use it.
*  They were going to do a call an Easter call
*  and they were going to put 20 people on it.
*  My family and my little cousins like, do you want to come on this?
*  I'm like, dude, let's stop.
*  And then he told me it was hard. It's 20 people.
*  We got elderly people on there who don't know what's going on.
*  They just being told to look into a phone, they have no idea what's happening.
*  There's 20 people. Half of them are drunk in their home.
*  They haven't seen the outside in a month.
*  And they're all screaming over each other.
*  It's like, yeah, this isn't a good use of anyone's time.
*  No. And also, they're doing these comedy things.
*  Did you see the one with Christ with Bert and Sandler?
*  It's probably the worst thing I've ever seen.
*  Yeah, that's when Bert said he called it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw that.
*  He has no idea what Sandler's done.
*  He didn't even know Sandler apparently was a comedian.
*  He thought Sandler was like a fucking doctor.
*  Happy Gilmore. What are you going to go?
*  Happy Madison or something.
*  Yeah. Then he said I'm going to watch like not uncut gems.
*  He said what? Precious gems or something.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Precious gems.
*  Yeah, he didn't know uncut gems.
*  And also he asked him, if you were to film one movie for the rest of your life,
*  what would it be? And he's like, am I on like morning TV?
*  I almost wondered if Bert was trolling.
*  I thought Bert was doing that on purpose.
*  Yeah, because it was brilliant.
*  You know what? It does certain things where I go,
*  I think he might be a genius because he does certain things.
*  I'm like, did he do that to just get that level of no.
*  Trust me. Trust me.
*  That's just Bert when he's not drunk.
*  And Bert's not drunk. He doesn't even know what reality is.
*  Why does his air feel so weird?
*  He's like, why is the sky blue? He doesn't know what the fuck life is.
*  But he's very smart in terms of like savvy marketing. He is good.
*  Well, he's relentless. He's relentless.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's he knows a lot about that stuff.
*  So he knows a lot about being relentless.
*  Yeah. Sometimes I'll see something he does.
*  And I'm like, that's smart.
*  Well, he makes good little video promos.
*  Yeah. Specials and tours and stuff like that.
*  He's good at that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's good at self promotion.
*  It's very true. So I didn't know if that was real.
*  I didn't know if he was really asking Adam Sandler.
*  He had Netflix.
*  I said, that seems odd to ask someone if they have Netflix.
*  When he's made movies for Netflix.
*  So I'm like, is he doing that as a bit?
*  I'm like, oh, good job.
*  He doesn't know what he's doing.
*  And he's making noises with his mouth and then trying to like
*  figure out what they are in real time.
*  That's what it is. I mean, yeah.
*  Bert should never be not drunk.
*  Wait a minute. You're flipping on this.
*  He should never be sober.
*  Yeah. He should be drunk all the time.
*  OK. Interesting. He should just be drunk.
*  Because he's better at it.
*  He's like he's amazing when he's when he's drunk.
*  If he's talking publicly.
*  But actually, when we did a podcast the other day,
*  he wasn't drunk for the beginning.
*  And then we started drinking.
*  And then we started smoking a little weed.
*  And then it got, let's come on.
*  Let's just hear you go. Yeah.
*  And he said that he had been sober the entire quarantine,
*  except for that one day.
*  Is he worried about Corona?
*  Oh, yeah, he should be. He's on high blood pressure medication.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, a lot of I'm a bigger guy.
*  I don't know if that's going to be a problem.
*  You know, Joey's a bigger guy.
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, these are I don't know how much that matters,
*  but it can't be good. It's definitely good.
*  It definitely matters. It matters for your immune system.
*  Yeah. You know, are you taking any CBD?
*  Do you take CBD at all? No.
*  But if I could take CBD, that wouldn't get me high because I'm sober.
*  So if I know that's what you get.
*  Yeah. You know, a lot of it has a percentage of.
*  Yeah. CBD, MD has.
*  Is that good for the immune system? Yes.
*  This actually won't try this.
*  This is a what is it?
*  Kilcliffe with 25 milligrams of CBD. Not a lot.
*  Is it coffee that I don't really drink?
*  No, no, there's no caffeine in that.
*  What is it? No, it's just I'll take it.
*  It's delicious. I'll just drink it.
*  I'm drinking it the whole show.
*  And what is the what is the best thing you could do for your immune system
*  if you don't want vitamin C vitamin C take a lot of vitamin C,
*  but particularly I eat an orange.
*  I have to take it. Yeah, you know, sure.
*  I like taking it, though, because it ensures that you're going to get a specific amount of it.
*  I take four thousand I use of vitamin D every day as well.
*  OK, I think that's that's really good.
*  I should start like a regimen of vitamins.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I take liposomal, glutathione every day.
*  Yeah, I take I may take a packet of vitamins every day.
*  When you took the test, were you like, hey, I want you would wanted the antibodies
*  or you were just like, I don't want any corona.
*  I would like to know that I had it and it bounced right off my immune system.
*  You know, yeah.
*  See, the thing is, I asked him, I go, OK, does this mean I was not exposed to it?
*  He goes, no. He goes, it's possible that you were exposed to it,
*  but your immune system fought it off before it ever got to your bloodstream.
*  What this antibody test means is that was in your bloodstream and your body fought it off.
*  Interesting. It never got into my bloodstream.
*  But he said it does not mean you weren't in contact with it.
*  So I go, OK, because when I came back, I came back from Vancouver and I was sick
*  and then they diagnosed it as strep. But they also said that's a common co-infection.
*  And a lot of people with time early March, March 3rd.
*  Oh, you might have had it. I think I find out in a couple of hours.
*  I think I had I think I had it. I think I had it. I beat it.
*  Really? I think I had it and I beat it.
*  Who? If I find out and of course I didn't. And they're going to tell me, no,
*  they're going to say you don't have it. But if I have those antibodies, I mean,
*  it's just going to be buck wild. There's a guy.
*  I'm just going to get on a plane and go to New York.
*  Did I send you the video? The guy on Thunderfoot, that guy from YouTube?
*  Yes. Yeah, he's a I think he's a chemist
*  and he's worked at CERN. Really, really intelligent, interesting guy.
*  He's making these YouTube videos on COVID-19 and how really how dangerous it actually is.
*  And his estimates are that if we opened up everything,
*  you could get death rates as high as three hundred thousand a day.
*  Yeah, which is like what? Yeah, it's crazy.
*  That would collapse the system, right? I mean, we could.
*  What do you got, Jamie? Announced the Council to Reopen America.
*  Ivanka Trump's on the council. I feel comfortable.
*  Yo, I feel comfortable. Well, well, well, children.
*  Kushner's on the council. Yeah.
*  Come on. These are his kids.
*  How is that? How is that not disgusting? Well, this is part of the problem with
*  his administration and even his conservative fans don't like this.
*  Well, there's seven people and two of them are in his family.
*  Like even Ann Coulter has said, listen, this is not what anyone signed up for,
*  giving your kids jobs. That is so crazy that he's taking this
*  girl who's like 30 years old and her goofy husband. And that is those are.
*  Are any of them, by the way, are any of these guys health people?
*  They're all financial people, right? Are any of these?
*  Do any of these people have anything to do with health?
*  I don't know. Who's Larry? Larry Cudlow is an economic advisor.
*  He was like a big coke head in the 80s. What about he was awesome.
*  I mean, he's fun. Yeah, but I don't think he knows.
*  Yeah, there's there's lines. There's things in a book about him doing coke.
*  Bill Gates is trying to kill everyone. Anyway, moving on the.
*  And Wilbur. What about Wilbur?
*  Wilbur Ross is the Commerce Secretary, right? I mean, I don't know.
*  He looks like he is a demon who's eating children.
*  Officials. I mean, look at his face.
*  Look at his face and you tell me he's not eating a child in the woods.
*  Maybe he has, right? He's like an outsider.
*  Mark Meadows looks like he's being blackmailed currently.
*  Yeah, it's a fun group. Yeah.
*  What are they blackmailing Mark for? I don't know.
*  I guess in a fictitious world. And this is just for fun.
*  Women tie him up and shit on him. Shit in his mouth or on his chest.
*  They tie him up in the bedroom. In a video.
*  Yeah, they probably hit him. And he tells them to take video.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And he calls them up and he goes,
*  I can't believe you have that video. Maybe a little fire dom too.
*  They call him up. They go, give me money. And he gives them money.
*  You know? Yeah, that's happening there. Yeah.
*  That's happening there. And Mnuchin.
*  Yeah. He could sue me if he doesn't like Mnuchin.
*  Do you think his wife fucks him with gloves on? I don't think anyone fucks him.
*  I think Mnuchin. He's got a hot wife, though.
*  He probably does. You have a lot of money. You get a hot wife.
*  You know, a lot of these guys. A lot of these guys do.
*  That's how they get money, right? They get money so they can have a hot wife.
*  That's the whole point. Otherwise, why would you get a lot of money?
*  To have a pedophile island or a hot wife?
*  But if you really had billions and billions of dollars and you didn't have a hot wife,
*  what are you doing with all that money? Fucking a lot of different hot women.
*  On the side? Yeah.
*  Keep them quiet? Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, that's part of it, right?
*  How much you got to give them to keep them quiet?
*  A lot. Not a lot. Enough.
*  But what keeps... Here's the thing. With a lot of these guys that are just money people,
*  what keeps them working? It's the same thing.
*  It's what keeps us doing. Stand up. It's just the desire.
*  I think it's just a desire to be good or great at something and just continually do something
*  and get better and better at it. They want to make more and more money. There's an endless...
*  You can never be the... Stand up is great because you never feel like you've mastered it.
*  And I think money is great because there's always more and more to get.
*  So these guys, it's a way for type A personalities to just throw themselves into something that
*  they'll never fully master. They're addicted. You get addicted to it. We all get addicted to it.
*  It's a game they're constantly playing and they're always looking to be in the black.
*  I know some guys that work for some very successful guys and it's just like it's
*  akin to a religious experience. That's how they feel the most alive.
*  When they're winning. When they're winning,
*  they feel the most alive. We feel really good on stage. That's where we feel alive.
*  Well, we feel really good creating. Creating.
*  Right. When you have a bit... When you put a bit... Or a video clip, like the Megan McCain video.
*  Anything. Yeah. When you're putting together those things, you're creating it and once it launches,
*  you're like, ha ha, we did it. We gave birth. We did a thing that was creative and funny. And
*  that's why podcasting now, thank God, because I don't know what the fuck I would do. If I wasn't
*  making these little videos and podcasting, I don't know what I would do. I mean, this has got to go
*  somewhere. Unless you're right, I will get sued. These poor fucks that don't have podcasts.
*  Yeah. Well, a lot of people, and I have sympathy for them, they thought that the stage was a
*  constant. And a lot of people believe that. Everybody was like, nobody can take away your
*  stand up. You're like, Bill Burrow was like, they can't take away your stand up or your podcast.
*  Everyone believed that. And then you never thought about a fucking pandemic. You never thought that
*  one day it would be illegal to gather. How long are you going to wait before you take the Bill
*  Gates vaccine? I'll think about... Listen, I'm pretty confident, Joe. I've beaten this and I
*  have antibodies, so I don't know that I need the vaccine. We're going to find out in an hour and a
*  half. I'm going to talk big because I think I beat it. But what happens after an hour and a half? If
*  it comes back like, nope, you have to trap throw. I will say the test is faulty. I will not believe
*  the test. No, I will take the Gates vaccine. My concern is for the tribal women. Yeah. I will take
*  the Gates vaccine. Do you think there's going to be a microship in that? This is what we got to watch.
*  This is what we got to watch. We have to watch these people. Tech people scare me a lot more
*  than financial people because financial people are crooks. You can see them coming a mile away.
*  Tech people think they're doing stuff for the greater good. They're more cult leaders.
*  It's very dangerous when you have all these people that are supposedly altruistic.
*  They're operating pretty much in the shadows. You don't know what they're doing. You don't know
*  where this money's coming from. But I'll probably take the vaccine. I'll probably take it.
*  Do you wish during this time that you smoked pot? Yes. Do you ever thought about starting up again?
*  No, because I think I would get too paranoid. Yeah, that's part of the fun. I know. How do you
*  feel about secondhand smoke? Can you handle it? Yeah, smoke it. You smoked last time. It was fine.
*  You smoke whatever you want. This keeps me together. No, you got to do it.
*  I'm going to go on a ventilator while you do that. I'm just going to sit here on a vent.
*  I would share this with you, Jamie, but you haven't been tested yet.
*  Is Jamie going to get the test or is he going to pus out? Everybody gets the test. Everybody
*  gets a test, man. You go on the list. Everybody gets the test today. Great. We know the results
*  right away. 15 minutes and then Delia's coming by tomorrow. I'm going to give Delia the test.
*  I'm excited, man. Before the fucking show. I want to keep him 13 feet away because I read something
*  online. Listen, I report you decide. If you had COVID right now with this test detected. Yes,
*  because you have the antibodies. So if I had it now and I was asymptomatic,
*  it's going to say, Hey, your body's fighting off the COVID. Wow. Interesting. So this is the big
*  one. Yeah. Okay. Test the blood. Yeah. Test the blood. And then also the, is it a quick one or
*  do they go in real quick? Okay. They can do the fucking swab of your brain cavity too. That's a
*  little much. That's a little much. Some people go for both tests. They really, really, really,
*  really want to know. But I don't think you need the, you got to do the blood first because then
*  you don't need the brain. You know, you know what? This has made me concentrate on more things that
*  I enjoy. That's true. I've given up my carnivore diet, even though I really do enjoy the carnivore
*  diet because I want pasta. Yeah. Every now and then you got to do something. I've been doing things.
*  I've been playing a lot of, a lot more pool. Do you want to go back on the road? Like you were,
*  no one does. Right? Nobody wants to be back on a plane every week anymore. Right. I just love
*  comedy. I want to go on the road, but like we were all on the road. Every, I was on a plane every
*  Thursday. Well, you kind of have to do it when you're building markets. Yeah. Well, I'm going to have
*  to do it. But I've been thinking about doing a residency in LA. I've been thinking about,
*  literally having shows every weekend in LA and then occasionally going on the road, like,
*  like getting a small theater. And I remember who used to do that. Was it Eddie Izzard?
*  It might've been Eddie Izzard who did, he did a residency in LA right off of La Cienega where he
*  was performing almost every weekend. It's a good idea. Not a bad idea if you have like a 500 seat
*  theater. I think once things open up again and people can start flying and things normalize
*  to a degree. Was it Eddie? Yeah. People can, people, yeah, people can come out again and.
*  At the Trepany house. So he had a mini residency back in 2012. That's what it was.
*  Yeah. Cause I mean the, the amount of traveling that I was doing now, I think to myself, I'm like,
*  you just put yourself at a lot of risk out there. You wear your immune system down.
*  Well, it's also, it's a drag, but, but there's people that are like, they're in Milwaukee or
*  Cleveland or whatever. They want to see you. They can't afford to come to LA and get a hotel room
*  and all that. You're going to want to come to them every now and then. You have to. Yeah. But I feel
*  like all that 20 weeks a year. That's, that's a lot. I was on the, I think I had 37 booked this year
*  a lot of them went away already and probably more than well, the worst seven weeks. I mean,
*  it's crazy. The worst I had was when I was doing the UFC 22 weekends a year. Geez. Yeah. That was
*  crazy. That's a lot. That was like every other weekend I was flying and then stand up too.
*  Yeah. But I wasn't doing as much stand up because those are the days also when I wasn't at the store.
*  Okay. That was when I was banned from the store. Okay. And it was also the days where I, I just had
*  a dumb idea that I could just do theaters on Friday night and do it like every weekend.
*  Right. And it'd be fine. Yeah. And it really wasn't. No. It wasn't enough. Yeah. Wasn't enough. Yeah.
*  Stand up just, it's like, if you ran every weekend, are you in shape? Right. You know,
*  you're in kind of shape. Partially. You can run every weekend, but you're not ready to rock. You're
*  not ready to go. Yeah. You're not ready to go. And that's how stand up is too. It's like, you can
*  feel comfortable enough. People are coming to see you. You can go on stage and perform,
*  but stand up is like, there's no real shortcuts. No. To do it right, you got to do it. You got,
*  first of all, I believe a bunch of things and they're not true with everybody, but I think
*  you have to go to the clubs. Yeah. And I think you have to go on stage at least four days a week.
*  And I think you have to write and I think you have to listen to your material. Now you can get away
*  with not doing one or two of those things, but those seems, they seem to be the core
*  tenants for doing your best. I figured out, like I build stuff on a podcast sometimes, like I will
*  talk. I'll talk for an hour a week on a podcast. That's a great way to kind of build something.
*  Yeah. That's a great way. Stan Hope told me. And I listen to my podcast back and then pick out
*  chunks of it that I'm like, Oh, that could be funny. Well, your podcast too. One of the things
*  that I like about you. So almost like you work yourself into a trance. Yes. Where you just,
*  a ranting trance. Yes. It seems like you have to build up momentum. I do. I do. I don't talk to
*  anyone for the whole day. It's true. I'll talk to anyone for the whole day. And then when my
*  producer comes over with the studios in the apartment and then we just, I just kind of go,
*  I have all this pent up and I just go. And that's like, you know, that's worked really well.
*  Cause it can be really funny. That's what it's really funny. Cause it's just like out there raw.
*  Sometimes the funniest stuff is just, I haven't ever said it before. And you don't have guests.
*  I don't have guests. I don't. You're doing it like Burr. Yeah. It's real interesting. Yeah. It's just
*  me. I think that's really strong for developing material. It's, it's yeah. And it's funny. You
*  know, people come to me and go, that's fun. Like it's not a, it's people go, there's enough of it.
*  It's really funny. And then sometimes it's ludicrous. I'm being ludicrous, but they,
*  they, they give you that room. Yes. Yeah. They have that room. Delia does that too. Yes. Delia
*  just, and Theo does a lot of that too. Just ranting. Yeah. Cause I'm a horrible interviewer.
*  Ah, it's no. Yes. You're not. I'm not horrible. No, you just don't do it. I just don't do it enough.
*  There's, I fucking sucked at it for years. Go back and listen to the early podcast. I was not good at
*  it. You don't know when you're being annoying. I'll interview somebody and I'll ask them a question
*  and then I'll answer it. Yeah. And I'll go, you know what, and that's a problem. That's because
*  you have a thought and you want to run with it. Right. It's just, it's different things. Right.
*  And like the ones I do with Joey are different than the ones I do with Duncan, which are different
*  than the ones I do with Delia or with you. It's like you have a dance you're doing with everybody.
*  And sometimes it's hard to figure out what, what steps you're taking. And yeah, you know,
*  yeah, it's tricky. I've done some good ones. We've had some, we have some good interviews in the
*  archive, but like a lot of times I got to be very interested. Yeah. Cause if I'm like, sometimes I've
*  had guys, I've had an XCA agent on it was very interested, right? Okay. When, when somebody comes
*  on and I'm not super interested in it, I can't, it's very hard for me to still do it. Right. Which
*  is a great thing about your show is when you bring people on, you give a fuck about what they're
*  saying. That seems to be the key. Like that's the key. Like if anybody ever said, like, how did your
*  podcast get successful? I think two things. One, I only talk to people that I want to talk to. So
*  no one's pushing anyone on me and people have pushed people on me and it's not worked out well.
*  The times that I've done it for favors, it's not good. Yeah. There's been some bad ones that were,
*  I wasn't interested in what they had to say. And I did it because someone was like really trying
*  to get me to have someone on. I got to do, I have to talk to the people that I want to talk to. It
*  has to be my idea because I've got to really be engaged. I've got to, and sometimes people have
*  brought me ideas for guests and it was good ideas and I was really engaged. Don't get me wrong. It's
*  not that I'm not open to suggestions, but that it seems to be, I have to genuinely want to do it.
*  Then it seems that while it's happening, I have to really be engaged in the conversation. Like I
*  have to, it has to be, if it's not organic, man, people get it. They know when you're
*  hosing them. Yeah. Well, people know that. Yeah. And most people in their life, which is kind of,
*  we've created lives where we can kind of be authentic. Like most people have to file into
*  certain, whether it's an office or wherever, and they have to just tolerate bullshit. Yes.
*  And they have to talk to people they don't like. And you've created a life where if you're not
*  interested in what somebody has to say, you don't have to speak to them. Well, it's also,
*  it doesn't mean that you're not going to get things wrong. And this is what people have to
*  understand. Like everyone's going to get things wrong if you talk as much as I do, but I think
*  I'm real honest about when I get it wrong. So like you have to be able to say like,
*  Oh, I shouldn't have said it that way. I shouldn't have done that. But it doesn't mean that you're
*  not going to get it wrong. It's just, you're going to get better at being you, right? Like you're,
*  you're really good at being you for these rants that you do. Burr's really good at being himself
*  for those rants. Amazing. He's probably the best at just no pauses. Yeah. No holds bar.
*  No holds bar. Just runs right through subjects with no preparation. It's great. Yeah. He's
*  developed, and Stan Hope's really good at it too. Like the man goes saying that Stan Hope,
*  his podcast kind of developed because he doesn't have open mic nights.
*  Right. Yeah. I use it because in LA, you know, it's, there's just,
*  it's less stage time than you would have some other places, even though there's enough,
*  you can do enough. And I was doing a lot in the road, but like it's more fun for me to just go
*  off. You're getting less stage time in LA than you were in New York. New York, you can get up
*  in a crazy amount. Really? Well, there's so many clubs. You can run from club to club to club to
*  club. I mean, guys like Mark Norman can do like 13 spots in a night. I mean, that's inhuman,
*  but that's why he's, you know, he's so good. It's like, you do so much. I like the amount of
*  stage time I get here because the podcast is a great way to build longer form bits than just
*  running where I have to get a laugh in front of an audience. But you could do both, right? Of course.
*  So you could do the podcast in New York and then just do 20 spots a night. Yes. Do you think that
*  would be the way to go? Is that the best way to do it? No, I think it depends what you, what your
*  act is, right? So if your act is quick, boom, boom, jokes, boom, boom, boom, a repetition is
*  probably better, but sometimes it's better to let an idea ruminate on a podcast and then to do maybe
*  longer sets less frequently. People might want to build that way. It's so individual, man. There's
*  no like one way to do it. I completely agree. And I think that there's like a, there's almost like a
*  formula where getting on stage is a hundred, right? Yeah. In terms of like the amount of
*  value you get for your effort, standing on, getting on stage is a hundred and writing is maybe 30 or
*  40. Yeah. But if you do it enough, it accumulates money in the bank, right? You know, in terms of
*  like numbers in the bank, got to do it to get, and I think that listening to a set is worth like 40 or
*  50. So writing's worth like 30 or 40, listening to sets worth like 40 or 50 and getting on stage
*  is worth a hundred. Yeah. Ralphie May did a great talk at, I think, I forget where it was. Maybe the
*  Comedy Store, maybe the Improv, I don't know, but he did a talk on standup where he said he used to
*  play a game with himself where like he'd give himself points if he did a new tag. Oh, you know,
*  and then he said something interesting. He goes, he goes, when's the last time you've gotten on stage
*  with five minutes, just new material, nothing else. He goes, cause the first time he got on stage,
*  you had five new minutes. So it was the first time he got on stage, you have the balls to get
*  up with five new minutes. And he goes, so when's the last time you've gotten up with just five new
*  minutes off the top, off the, and it makes you think it's like, yeah, that's, you know, that's a
*  ballsy move to go out with just a new five and go, I'm just good doing this. Yeah. And it's always
*  bad in the beginning. Yeah. Do you think we're all going to be starting over again when we get, I mean,
*  not starting over, but when we get back on stage, it's going to be, it's going to be so long as a
*  lot of us have gone. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think I went through when I, when I was like in my 20s and I
*  had ACL surgery for the first time, that was like a 90 fuck early nineties. What I had never been
*  off stage for like two weeks before. Right. So two weeks later after knee reconstruction, I was going
*  on stage with crutches on. I was like, fuck it. I'm going up. I was like, I'm going up. So I'd go
*  on stage and hobble with a knee brace on two weeks after surgery. I'm like, I can't, I can't not be
*  off stage, but then I went, I forget why, but I went even more than that one time in like the
*  early two thousands. I think I went a whole month, a month plus I'm trying to remember like, what's
*  the longest time it's ever been. I think with me is a few weeks for a lot of us, a few weeks.
*  Some people do get, get, do like maybe a TV thing or movie and it's like a month, but it's, it,
*  this is going to be the longest stretch. I think I've gone more than a month. Yeah. But I'm not
*  sure how long, whether it was two months. If you had to bet what, when do you think our feet touch
*  a stage again? Late May. And I think, yeah, I think there's going to be some weird shit where
*  you're going to have like one table and then there'll be like three empty tables and then another
*  table, like a line of people that'd be like dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,
*  yeah. A lot of people are going to be wearing masks. That's going to be creepy as fuck. So
*  weird. And then they're going to be, we're going to have to have masks now.
*  Dude, I don't know, man. This is a post-apocalyptic standup.
*  Everyone's got a mask. What if there's a flu that's 50% as deadly as COVID-19? Well, I mean,
*  let's worry about the one we have now is bad enough. I know, but Paul, but it's not. We have
*  a pandemic. The thing is like the numbers of people that have died of the flu this year are way higher.
*  For now. For now. For now. For now. For now. But it's going to go up. But my point is
*  if we are upset that the amount of people that have died from COVID-19, if this is the last
*  person that dies, and it won't be, surely, but if this is the last person that dies,
*  what would be, how close would the flu have to get to that for us to take commensurate measures?
*  Like if we found, like if the flu, I don't know what the number is and I don't think they know
*  entirely how many people get infected versus how many people die. Cause I don't think they
*  really know how many people get infected. And if COVID, they were saying that as much as 70%
*  of the people that get it are asymptomatic. So how many people really get it? So if that means,
*  maybe there's a lot more people that got it and then they're just not showing symptoms or
*  is it, we don't have accurate data. I think it's probably, we don't have accurate data.
*  Right. I think a lot of people definitely get it and don't have any symptoms because there seems
*  to be a lot of evidence of that, but I don't think they know how many people got it. We might have
*  a very small number of people that have got it and out of those people, the vast majority show
*  no symptoms, but it might be like 1% of the population has been infected. We don't even know.
*  Part of the problem with keeping everyone on a lockdown is that nobody's developing immunity.
*  That's part of it. That's part of the issue, right? So you're slowing the spread of this.
*  But it's too dangerous to give people that option.
*  Of course, of course. But eventually you're going to have to start opening the economy,
*  people carefully going out with masks and things like that.
*  I think for sure, but I think here's something that-
*  Is takeout safe?
*  They've told us that's safe. I order that. I think it's safe.
*  How could it be?
*  It's not safe.
*  There's things on surfaces.
*  That's what I mean.
*  So many sneezes on your egg roll.
*  But here's the deal. On that Diamond Princess cruise ship, only 17% of people got it. Those
*  people are living together very close quarters like a Petri dish.
*  Yep. And they're all breathing recirculated air.
*  Yeah, but only 17% of people got it.
*  Crazy. How is that possible?
*  Because I don't think it's as transmissible as we think.
*  Bro, imagine being stuck on one of those cruise ships with people coughing in the distance.
*  It's horrible without a pandemic.
*  But I don't think-
*  But imagine right now, because I'm high.
*  So let me think. If I'm in a boat right now, right?
*  So I'm in this metal thing, which is in the middle of the dark ocean, especially at nighttime.
*  Yeah.
*  Right? So you're in this thing floating around, literally in the center of the goddamn ocean.
*  For some strange reason, you've agreed to be on this metal thing that floats.
*  Which doesn't make any sense. First of all, metal floating makes zero sense.
*  A giant metal thing floating. Look at all those fucking people.
*  And you're there with the worst people in the world.
*  And if you fall off the side, you're dead.
*  Some people try to kill themselves. You know what's really- this is true.
*  Some guy tried to kill himself on the boat. This is how sad this was. They saw him.
*  They caught him and they brought him back on the boat.
*  Spot on.
*  So literally at the buffet the next day, everybody's like,
*  that's the guy that tried to kill himself. How horrible is that? You're back. You're back.
*  Imagine being at a breakfast buffet after the-
*  Sorry guys, I was having a rough night.
*  One guy killed his wife on a cruise. Because I went on the Impractical Joker's cruise.
*  I went on one cruise and it was just to perform. Me and a bunch of other comics went.
*  We were talking to some of the cruise people and they said one guy pushed his wife off the side.
*  Yeah. And then he didn't care. He went to like 80s night, he was dancing.
*  He just pushed his wife right off the side.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Cruise people are sick. They're sick people. Some people are sick. Some people could do that.
*  Now here's the thing. We're thinking about it like it's the ocean.
*  I want you to think about it like it's space.
*  Imagine if there was this ship that was going through space, but space was just like-
*  it was almost like there was air around you where you could kick someone off the side
*  and they would just fall to forever.
*  You're doing the same thing.
*  Yeah.
*  You're just-
*  Would you be terrified?
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah. And if you heard someone cough?
*  Would you have heard someone cough?
*  Oh my God. What would you do? What would you do if you were on a spaceship
*  and you heard someone coughing?
*  It would take two weeks before you get back to the planet.
*  I think you got to stay in your little cube. Like you got to stay in your little room.
*  Everyone on the Grand Princess was sequestered in their room.
*  Honestly, how is that different?
*  You being on a spaceship in the middle of the sky and you hear someone coughing.
*  It's not that different.
*  We got to get out of here. There's a sick person on a spaceship.
*  It's not that different.
*  How much different is it?
*  It's not that different.
*  I would say this. I would say less pig trash people could afford to go to space.
*  For now.
*  For now.
*  Back in the fucking Titanic days, it was a crazy thing to be able to get in a boat
*  and make your way across the country.
*  Yeah.
*  It's true.
*  Now you're a peasant.
*  That scares me.
*  Space cruises, which is disgusting.
*  But the people, my point is it's not like the uber wealthy people that are getting on these
*  cruise ships.
*  No, it's animals.
*  It's savage animals.
*  They're fat pigs.
*  I could have been a personal trainer on the boat.
*  People are looking at me like, how do you do it?
*  No, it's a real party.
*  They're going to have a good time.
*  You know, it's the funniest thing on that boat.
*  There was a little library and I walked in.
*  I'm like, has anyone checked out a book?
*  And the guy goes, no.
*  I'm like, has anyone ever checked out?
*  There was a library and the cruise ship.
*  And it's not even good books.
*  It's trashy romance novels, but none of these people can read.
*  What is the drug policy on one of those cruise ships?
*  Can you bring weed on board?
*  I think you can bring whatever you want.
*  I mean, it depends, right?
*  It depends if you dock at a con.
*  Yeah, but in international waters, what are the deals?
*  I don't know.
*  They don't search.
*  I don't know if they search your bags.
*  I mean, people were bringing food on board.
*  That was disturbing.
*  That's another thing, right?
*  You're not in America.
*  No, you're in international waters and then you dock outside of this fake little town in Mexico
*  where they literally bought the beachfront and it's a third world country
*  and they drive you past roosters and shoeless guys running around.
*  Jamie, what are you showing me?
*  This is Doug Sandope in his booze suit when he was getting on the cruise.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  He got on the cruise and he...
*  Dude, he came on...
*  He taped booze to his body, right?
*  All over it.
*  Like drugs?
*  Yeah.
*  So what does he got?
*  He had bladders of gin.
*  Bladders.
*  Bladders and bottles of booze.
*  So he bought those hiking bladders that you put in your backpack where you drink water
*  and he filled them with booze.
*  But he's on a cruise ship where they have all this booze.
*  Yeah, but he wants the real deal stuff.
*  They're going to water it down.
*  They do?
*  Yeah.
*  They don't give you shots?
*  I think they do some...
*  That's even more outrageous.
*  I think you gotta watch.
*  If they don't let you booze it up.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, if I'm on a boat, I'm getting drunk.
*  I'm sure there's different kinds of cruises, but the ones we're talking about like Carnival.
*  I know.
*  If you were on those, wouldn't you want to be hammered?
*  Well, there's people...
*  I'd want to be hammered.
*  Dude, that's why people are like, oh, why are people leaving their houses?
*  There are people that are like, if I can't go on a cruise and get fucked up, I don't want to live.
*  There are those people right now.
*  They're like, if I can't go to Applebee's, I don't want to live.
*  Yeah, there's people that are not having a great time in America.
*  How many people are like weekend cruise people?
*  Every weekend they go on a cruise somewhere.
*  I was on...
*  I'm telling you, I did have the practical joke.
*  There was an old lady and she goes, you know, don't take Carnival.
*  It's very bad.
*  We've taken it twice.
*  It was horrible times.
*  Norwegians good.
*  Yeah, they just...
*  They're cruise people.
*  I mean, just the lowest caliber of human being to have ever drawn a breath.
*  How much is the cruise cost?
*  Like if you want to...
*  $50?
*  Dude, it's like no money.
*  It's too...
*  Okay, let's say if you're going...
*  It's for people that just got out of prison.
*  Let's say if you're going to leave Mexico and you...
*  Where would you go?
*  Where would you go?
*  Like South America?
*  No, you don't leave Mexico.
*  You just go out into the ocean and then you just come back to some fake town.
*  We went to Costa Maya.
*  Look up Costa Maya, Mexico.
*  Costa Maya, Mexico is a place that's owned...
*  The cruise ships just own this little beachfront.
*  Okay, so it's like a trip.
*  Like you float around the water and then you come back.
*  And you come back and then they just have these little stands on the beach.
*  Wait a minute, this is crazy.
*  Cruises to Mexico from $109 a person?
*  What did you think it was?
*  For how many days?
*  Like seven days.
*  No.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Is that real?
*  Of course.
*  Oh my God, look at the big warning though.
*  The COVID warning.
*  Blow that up.
*  Yeah.
*  What does it say, Jamie?
*  They're like, you'll die if you do this.
*  People don't care.
*  Please be aware of any coronavirus, COVID-19 travel advisories and view updates
*  from the World Health Organization.
*  Due to unprecedented volume of travel disruptions,
*  refunds may take up to 30 days to process.
*  Which by that point, you'll be dead.
*  They'll be like 30 days is...
*  Are they allowed to take cruises right now?
*  Yeah, they're just like lie about your symptoms.
*  This is the next one they have available.
*  It seems like August 30th is the first one they have available.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're banking on August 30th.
*  Dude, that boat's already full.
*  People are going on that boat.
*  Bro.
*  Dude, August 30th is going to be a party.
*  They don't give a shit.
*  They're going to get on in hospital gowns right from the ER.
*  They don't care.
*  You know what they're going to do?
*  They're going to do all the people that have survived.
*  Yes.
*  Coronavirus survivors.
*  It's going to be survivor party.
*  We beat it.
*  They also would have the antibodies.
*  Of course.
*  They're all going to have the bracelets.
*  They'll be in hospital gowns on the beach.
*  But you know there's going to be one dude who lies about it.
*  Everybody's going to lie.
*  He's going to come back because there's a girl.
*  They're going to be fake bracelets.
*  She's hot.
*  He wants to fuck her.
*  So he told her, yeah, I've got it.
*  And she's not hot, but she's a girl.
*  She's hot enough.
*  He's fine.
*  She's hot enough for him to cause genocide.
*  So he's going to come back with this virus.
*  He's going to kill us all.
*  He's going to destroy everybody.
*  He's going to kill us all because he wanted to fuck this chick.
*  He's going to lie about having it.
*  She's got a new advanced form that doesn't do anything to people that have already had it.
*  But as soon as it gets into a new person, it kills them.
*  It makes so much sense that the virus that will get rid of us as a planet come from a cruise,
*  the most disgusting, unnecessary.
*  I thought it would be tropical.
*  It has nothing to do with the water.
*  It has nothing to do with the water.
*  Nobody swims.
*  Nobody gets to the island and swims.
*  It's kind of a dump.
*  People just go on and buy shitty jewelry.
*  They buy fake jewelry.
*  Dude, there's a TV in your room on a cruise.
*  And when you turn it on, it's just commercials for shit you can buy when you dock at the island.
*  Oh my God.
*  It'll be a guy who's like, I've been in the cruise and jewelry industry for 20 years.
*  It's like, that's not an industry.
*  Dude, the cruise is a hundred dollars.
*  Yeah, it's a hundred dollars.
*  And they buy garbage jewels because it's tax free.
*  How long is that cruise, Jamie?
*  That was the three to five days section.
*  That is insane.
*  Five days for a hundred bucks.
*  You can't even live for a hundred bucks for five days just for food.
*  All you can eat.
*  All you can eat.
*  Yeah, and probably all you can drink.
*  Everything's free except for alcohol.
*  That might be the craziest thing we've ever read on this show.
*  That's why people are like, all cruisers are going out of business.
*  I'm like, I'll tell you, they're not.
*  They're not.
*  That's a vacation for somebody who's fucked.
*  So, but wait a minute.
*  It's not all booze included.
*  No, you got to pay for booze.
*  That's where they make their money.
*  That's why they sneak it on.
*  That's why they sneak it on.
*  That's how they make their money.
*  So the 25 bucks a day is just to come on.
*  We're friends.
*  Yeah.
*  Four days.
*  That's just five bucks a day.
*  A hundred bucks.
*  That's just unlimited fried food to throw down your throat.
*  Three to five days for a hundred dollars.
*  A hundred and nine.
*  Imagine five days of food for a hundred and nine dollars.
*  They probably encourage you to get off the wagon.
*  Like, what are you doing?
*  You drinking water?
*  Yeah, well, I'm clean and sober for 15 years.
*  Oh, they don't tolerate that.
*  What the fuck are you doing on this boat, man?
*  It's a carnival.
*  Haven't you heard?
*  Yeah.
*  You don't need to see your kids.
*  Get fucked up.
*  Just get fucked up and we'll give you Ibogaine.
*  In a cruise boat, there's a little cruise jail.
*  Swear to God.
*  They have a cruise.
*  They have a cruise jail.
*  If you do something, sometimes you got to go to the cruise jail
*  until they can dock and have the authorities come get you.
*  See, if you murder your wife, you do something like that.
*  You go to the cruise jail.
*  The guy threw his wife overboard.
*  Did they throw him in the cruise jail?
*  He went to cruise jail.
*  Look, there's a water slide.
*  Look at these people.
*  Hi.
*  See, this is in the 80s.
*  I guess what it made sense.
*  When did they start these things?
*  Dude, there's comics that perform on them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They live in hell.
*  Yeah.
*  There's something about it.
*  It's just so strange.
*  And when I was in Italy, three-day cruises for $325.
*  That was when it first started.
*  Yeah, 85.
*  That was 1985.
*  That's what it was.
*  Yeah.
*  It's probably like air travel.
*  When I was in Venice, there were the people that are locals there.
*  First of all, I'm an intruder.
*  We're all intruders.
*  There's too many.
*  Too many tourists.
*  But they relied on it, too.
*  So it's real strange.
*  That's their economy.
*  But it used to be more quaint.
*  And then what happened is whenever a cruise ship would pull up,
*  you would get 2,000, 3,000 people would come pouring out at once.
*  So when we were there, two cruise ships docked.
*  And it was crazy.
*  Wow.
*  Crazy.
*  Venice is this beautiful city.
*  And then you have this grotesque cruise ship with paintings of dolphins on the side.
*  It's so white trash.
*  America just showing up.
*  And then they would fill these river boats.
*  And they would get into the canal area.
*  And they were filled with people.
*  And they would drive around staring and pointing at things.
*  You'd be like, wow, this is nuts.
*  Well, now that they're not around, you have things that are coming back into the Venice
*  canals like dolphins.
*  I know.
*  But I know all these idiots are like, oh, it's not nice.
*  It's like, it's nice.
*  But the world economy has collapsed.
*  It's not a good trade-off.
*  The people got addicted to people coming in, the tourists.
*  But if they only had a limited number, it should be like a house party.
*  After 100 people, you can't get out.
*  Cut it off.
*  Cut it off.
*  You can't have cruise ships.
*  Because they kept hitting the docks too.
*  No, but you're going to need them.
*  They're coming back hard.
*  Cruises are coming back so big after this.
*  I'm telling you, people are going to feel we're a sick country.
*  And people all over the world, people are wild.
*  And people are going to want to go on.
*  There are people that love cruises.
*  They think they've discovered a gold mine.
*  They'll be like, 109.
*  People will tell you, I took a cruise for $160.
*  It's so embarrassing that they say that.
*  And you're like, you're an animal.
*  Well, if you're a non-drinker, though, it must be amazing.
*  It's so fun.
*  There's a certain group of people in the world who've accepted they're animals.
*  And then it's just fun.
*  How many people are on cruises that are on a cruise every day?
*  Because it's cheaper than being homeless.
*  If you go to a cruise every day, if you're on a cruise every day,
*  you're really only spending like $1.50 a week.
*  That's carnival secure.
*  And at $150 a week, you get a room and you get all the food you can eat.
*  That is a crazy deal.
*  You imagine?
*  It's secure for homelessness.
*  Carnival cruises.
*  And they have booze there.
*  Do they have booze 24 hours a day or do they have a cutoff time?
*  No.
*  So it's like Vegas.
*  Of course.
*  Do what you want.
*  Imagine that.
*  The freedom of being on this boat, this metal thing floating around the ocean.
*  That's where you live.
*  Where do you live?
*  I live on the Carnival Cruise Line.
*  There are people that do that, Joe, that literally live on a boat all year round.
*  Why not?
*  You should be on a cruise every day of the year.
*  Because you're a person.
*  That's the why not is because you're a person.
*  But if you're not, there are people that do the level of big on those boats.
*  Those are big boys and girls.
*  Like Disneyland.
*  Four, five hungees.
*  Yeah.
*  When you see people on scooters.
*  I saw a scooter and they were going on the boat.
*  They were going up the ramp on the boat.
*  There's something fucked up about being on a vehicle and somebody on another vehicle.
*  World's longest cruise hit sail from London.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They left in September on a 245 day cruise.
*  Do you think that they're still out there?
*  Oh, they're still out there.
*  They'd be safe if they're all dead.
*  Oh, my God.
*  It's a Viking ship.
*  The ship is just coughing at this point.
*  Look at the size of it.
*  Go back.
*  Is that a video?
*  Yeah, a video.
*  Go back to the size of it when they pull up.
*  Would they have Viking, Carnival?
*  Is this a Viking?
*  Yeah, look how big.
*  But it looks like the name Viking is perfect for something like that.
*  The oasis of the seas is the beginning of Viking.
*  That's perfect.
*  That was filled with Vikings and it came pulling into your shore.
*  You'd be like, oh, fuck.
*  But this is not Vikings eating herring.
*  This is people who are just there are more chefs.
*  Viking son.
*  That's what it is.
*  There are more chefs on that boat than doctors in the places they're going.
*  They're pulling up to an island with two doctors and they've got 65 people cooking.
*  So is this thing still out there?
*  That's what I was asking.
*  I just was googling how long was the longest trip.
*  A lot of them, they're not letting them dock.
*  This was $92,000 per person.
*  This is a lot of money.
*  That's a big one.
*  $92,990 per person, which includes business class, airfare, meals, and a free excursion
*  in each port of call.
*  So these people just decided to live on this thing.
*  For a year.
*  For almost a year.
*  And see the world.
*  How many days, Jamie?
*  245.
*  Oh, ships free of kids in casinos.
*  Interesting.
*  Wow.
*  That's interesting.
*  These are the higher end ones, even though they're gross too.
*  Yeah, no kid or casinos.
*  Is that what it said?
*  A lot of cruises, a lot of it's gambling.
*  It's a lot of people that want to gamble.
*  But this is a fairly small thing, right?
*  It's like 900 people.
*  It's interesting too.
*  They have a world class lecture.
*  They have like TED Talks going on there.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  Maybe they knew something was coming.
*  Let me tell you.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  It built gates on the boat.
*  Talk about it.
*  Don't worry.
*  We're getting everybody.
*  Nobody needs HPV.
*  Pills catch the cover.
*  Yeah.
*  Tribal folk.
*  There were no TED Talks on the boat I was on.
*  But imagine, that's a great idea.
*  Like if you were an older person, like a couple, and you're like, you know, your kids leave
*  the house.
*  Let's hang out together.
*  Let's do a year on a boat.
*  Do it.
*  But did you scream and while they're drunk around the third or fourth week, you go, what
*  the fuck are we doing?
*  What are we doing?
*  What are we doing?
*  There's something weird looking out just in water.
*  Yes.
*  There's something weird forever and going, is there a doctor on this?
*  And if something happens, what kind of doctor, what kind of doctor works on Carnival Cruise
*  Line?
*  What kind of, you know what I mean?
*  It's not the best.
*  It's not the best doctor.
*  Allegedly.
*  Yeah.
*  He might be amazing.
*  He might be a guy that's his college.
*  Can you imagine being sick and being in the Carnival Cruise doctors office?
*  You'd be like, just throw me overboard.
*  Probably experiment on people.
*  Oh, God.
*  That's where Gates is fucking using the vaccines.
*  He's putting them in fat people on Carnival Cruise Line.
*  They can't find a vein.
*  They can experiment with people in exchange for a free fare.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it was one of the weirdest things I've ever done.
*  I did it three nights.
*  I performed.
*  Those are great.
*  Kasselvakan is a great dude.
*  He invited us all.
*  He also does stand up.
*  He's one of the jokers.
*  But I mean, it's a wild party over there.
*  And after three days, you're like, get me off.
*  Get me back.
*  And we left out of New Orleans, which is cool.
*  Did you do it with Kreischer and Ari?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  How fucked up does Burt get on a boat?
*  You know, I'm trying to remember.
*  I don't remember being more fucked up or less fucked up than usual.
*  I think he was just.
*  I don't know.
*  It was he was drinking.
*  I think it was right after Sober October.
*  Yes.
*  Right after Sober October.
*  He was having fun.
*  He was enjoying himself.
*  But he's never like too.
*  He goes hard in the paint.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he always handles himself well, though.
*  What's amazing about Burt is how good a shape he's in.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The amount of booze.
*  And he does.
*  He runs a lot.
*  Yeah.
*  But I was telling him, I was like, dude, your body is so robust.
*  He's tough.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, if you didn't drink at all, you would probably be a savage.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he was very shaped young.
*  Well, he was in shape for sure.
*  But I'm saying like the kind of like work he's making his body go through every day.
*  Every day he's making his liver process.
*  I know.
*  All that hooch.
*  At the end, it's tough.
*  But you also said earlier that he shouldn't speak publicly if not drunk.
*  No, he should drink.
*  So he should drink every time he says something.
*  He's better that way.
*  I guess it's out there somewhere, that ship.
*  Eight Canadians allowed to disembark from Viking Sun cruise ship in Gibraltar for repatriation.
*  What the hell happens to the rest of them?
*  For repatriation.
*  Imagine you're going to live in Gibraltar.
*  Jesus.
*  Well, what is it, quarantine?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  But I mean, it sounds hilarious.
*  It just sounds like something from a Game of Thrones book.
*  Yeah, repatriation.
*  This has been announced by the government, which says that
*  this follows a request from the Canadian High Commissioner in London for Gibraltar's help in
*  repatriating the seven passengers and one crewman.
*  Yeah, I don't even know what the fuck.
*  Number six says the disembarkation took place in the bay, not alongside the cruise terminal.
*  So they went to a smaller boat in the bay and then were probably brought to the...
*  Yeah, it says that there's no cases of COVID-19 on board the Viking Sun,
*  which had submitted a clear maritime declaration as therefore clear to enter the port.
*  That would be what would happen.
*  There would be a virus that runs through us like fire through bushes,
*  and they would repopulate the earth, these TED Talk people on this fucking cruise for 245 days.
*  That might be what it is.
*  Well, that's how you usher in the movie Idiocracy, if the only people that survived are the cruise pigs.
*  But these are the TED Talk cruise pigs.
*  They're a different breed.
*  Okay, you're right about that.
*  And they're also spending $93,000 to do this thing for 245 days.
*  But they're all probably older.
*  They're probably older.
*  There's probably only a few young people that are doing that.
*  There's no eggs.
*  Yeah, there's no eggs on that boat.
*  No eggs.
*  Dude, it's the crew.
*  It's got to be the crew.
*  The crew fucks their way out of this.
*  And those are weird too.
*  The crew is all people that work at the fucking Tiger Sanctuary.
*  People that work on cruises are weird too, man.
*  It was very strange.
*  It's odd.
*  Yeah, they have to be.
*  Those are guys that partied and they're just like,
*  what if this was every night forever?
*  And you're like-
*  I ran into a comic at the port.
*  I was with the missus on vacation.
*  Yeah.
*  And I ran into a comic at a port in Mexico.
*  And he had just gotten off this boat and the dude looked like someone stole some of his essence.
*  Like something, they looked like someone had taken like 10 to 15% of what makes him a person.
*  And he was just working on the boat.
*  Well, it wasn't like running into someone at Hilarities in Cleveland.
*  No, no.
*  Like what's up?
*  Some fun club.
*  I love that club.
*  Yeah.
*  All the fucking shows are awesome.
*  This was not that happy feeling.
*  Yeah, no.
*  It was like, ugh.
*  It's like rough.
*  The fucking bur-
*  And just realizing like this is what I'm doing for a living now.
*  This is a tough one.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm on a boat.
*  I'm entertaining the worst people in the world in the middle of the ocean.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know who loves those things though?
*  Again, shout out to Alonzo Bowden.
*  Alonzo Bowden goes on jazz cruises.
*  Well, those may be different.
*  That might be different.
*  People that like jazz, I mean, that's a little different.
*  They're just people that go,
*  I want to spend $35 to go on a vacation with my family
*  because I can eat on a floating thing.
*  Yeah, that's different.
*  I mean, they don't even go and like do anything cool.
*  Yeah, you'd have to have a cruise and the cruise would have to be populated by,
*  it would have to be like people that are into shit you're into.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's a lot of those.
*  Like there's all kinds of cruise.
*  I mean, dude, there's like, I mean, there's like sick cruises.
*  There's a walking dead cruise where people dress up like zombies.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Stuff like that's crazy.
*  What if we did a working comedian cruise?
*  Your JRE cruise.
*  Only people that are actual comedians and they're significant others.
*  Interesting.
*  Interesting.
*  We'd hate each other.
*  But five days and this floaty thing in the middle of the ocean.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, someone would yell at Bert.
*  We'd have to like, we'd have to have a sit down.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't be really mad at Bert.
*  If you're not on time, you get left.
*  So how many people are going to get left at the first port?
*  Oh, Bobby Lee's never making it on board.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of people would not get on.
*  Tony Ainsliep's barely going to make it on.
*  Yeah, it would be bad.
*  It would be bad.
*  Comics are all irresponsible.
*  Very much.
*  The funny ones in particular.
*  Oh, super irresponsible.
*  Yeah.
*  Most of them are.
*  Yeah.
*  Most of them are a mess.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  They wouldn't make it on board.
*  But imagine if the only people that survive are the people on that cruise.
*  That would be amazing.
*  That's a Stephen King type of novel.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Just the people aboard this cruise ship now have to think.
*  But think of how cool that is to be on a cruise ship and sail back to an America
*  where everybody's dead.
*  Well, that would be great.
*  They left London though, right?
*  That's where it leaves.
*  It left London 245 days.
*  Yeah, last week it said they had arrived in Bali.
*  I was trying to track information about it.
*  Imagine you're in the middle of this thing that you've been planning for a whole year.
*  I can't believe we're going to do it.
*  Oh my God, we're really going to do it.
*  Right.
*  We're going to do 245 days.
*  Why not?
*  The kids are out of the house.
*  I love being around you.
*  Right.
*  We're having a great time together.
*  It's going to be fun.
*  And you're in the middle of the ocean.
*  You find out the world's on fire.
*  How about those guys on that show, Big Brother, who were being kept in isolation,
*  that reality show in Germany.
*  They had no idea.
*  And somebody had to stop them and go, hey, by the way, just to let you guys know,
*  there's a worldwide pandemic ravaging the plague.
*  Like that's a crazy.
*  My friend, Adam Green Tree, the dude who shot that water buffalo that's above the head up there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's my bow hunting friend from Australia.
*  He was actually in the bush when the shit hit the fan and he got back to his car and
*  someone had written in dirt on the window, call home ASAP, something like that.
*  See, he's down his Instagram.
*  Yeah.
*  He actually took a photo of it and put it on his Instagram.
*  So he had no idea.
*  It's like that thing right after 9-11, there was dust on a car window.
*  Somebody wrote, this is war.
*  Get home ASAP.
*  Wow.
*  So that's scary as fuck.
*  But he goes off the grid.
*  He's a bow hunter and he goes to these like really remote locations.
*  And he just brings a backpack and like a small tent with him and water purification and arrows
*  and he fucking goes.
*  He goes.
*  And he'll go for like six, seven days like that.
*  And so that's one of the things he did.
*  So he was completely, you know, so he left before there was even talk of this.
*  So he's got that, that's his back.
*  And that's it.
*  Little backpack.
*  So this is a very satisfying feeling in having everything you need on your back.
*  First day into some spectacular New Zealand country, Insta story uploaded daily.
*  So he was just going up there and by himself with no one with him,
*  no contact with the outside world.
*  But I guess he was still updating his Instagram.
*  Who's taking that photo?
*  He usually gets back home usually, but this time he might've been there.
*  He said he's updating it daily.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  But either way.
*  So he comes back and he finds that note on his car.
*  I mean, a lot of what he does, he does and he documents for social media because one
*  time back in the day, it was like two years ago, he was doing this 28 day hunt by himself
*  in Idaho and in Wyoming, including like encounters that he would stream with a fucking grizzly bear.
*  So he had a grizzly bear that was chasing after him.
*  He had a faulty pistol on him.
*  He didn't even know that the pistol didn't work.
*  It had the wrong size of ammo in it.
*  Yeah.
*  And he documented all of it and we started talking about it on the podcast.
*  So he developed this like really engaged social media following that really gets excited when
*  he goes on these trips.
*  Expeditions.
*  Uploads.
*  So this is it.
*  So that's him with a gun and see that if you could see the gun, the bullet is not in the chamber.
*  It's jammed.
*  That's why it's open like that.
*  So that bullet wouldn't even fired and that's a grizzly bear in the background.
*  Yeah.
*  And she's got a cub with her and she's thinking about fucking him up and she bluff charges him
*  a couple of times and he tries to get away from her.
*  He tries to walk away and she followed him.
*  Really creepy shit.
*  What do you do in that instance?
*  What he did, he stood his ground and she came charging at him.
*  He said she got within several feet of him a couple of times before she turned away.
*  So what makes it, what do you think a bear decides at that point?
*  They just go have fuck it.
*  You never know man.
*  It's either going to decide it's going to kill you or it's going to try to scare you.
*  If it decides to kill you, it's over.
*  It's over.
*  Yeah.
*  It's over.
*  There's nothing you can do.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially if you have a gun that doesn't work.
*  Well that's the thing.
*  You'd have to have a gun.
*  Yeah.
*  They would tear you apart like you would tear apart a little baby chick.
*  Like a little baby chicken.
*  Yeah.
*  You could do that.
*  That's how a bear would tear you apart.
*  Yeah.
*  They're so big and they kill moose.
*  Yeah.
*  They kill deer.
*  They're monsters.
*  Elk with their face.
*  Just grab a hold of them, rip them apart.
*  They're so strong man.
*  It fucks you up because they're cute looking.
*  They look like cuddly but they're not.
*  They're like a 900 pound Rottweiler.
*  Do you ever watch those things where guys like hug them and live with them?
*  And like.
*  Assholes.
*  Yeah it's weird.
*  Assholes.
*  Very strange.
*  You crazy fucks.
*  Whitney Cummings was explaining to me how all these tigers are tortured.
*  I didn't really know.
*  I didn't know about all that.
*  I didn't know that they were drugged and stuff.
*  Well I thought the tigers kind of liked being showmen.
*  I don't think that's stupid.
*  The ones on Tiger King.
*  Yeah.
*  Those weren't drugged.
*  I don't think they were drugged.
*  Well some of them looked.
*  They drugged them when they moved them.
*  Yeah yeah but they some of them look.
*  They just looked in there in these confined spaces.
*  It looks.
*  It's hell.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not right.
*  It's not right.
*  They're wild animals.
*  Well it's not just that.
*  It's also they're cats.
*  And if there's anything that cats like more than anything it's to kill.
*  They love killing shit.
*  Right.
*  And I don't think.
*  I'm not saying that it's great that they kill things.
*  I'm not like glorifying or even joking around about this.
*  I'm just saying think about what a cat is.
*  Right.
*  Just think about a house cat.
*  House cats are some of the most vicious fucking monsters.
*  They're horrible.
*  They walk the face of the planet.
*  All they want to do is kill.
*  And they're not even a little hungry.
*  They try to kill you.
*  They swipe at your face.
*  They're trying to kill you.
*  Yeah they just know that they're outgunned so they let it go.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But they're so small and they kill so much.
*  House cats kill billions of birds and mammals every year.
*  Billions of them.
*  Right.
*  Just they go outside and fuck these things up.
*  Yeah of course.
*  And come back inside.
*  And now imagine being something like that but it's your 700 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  All you want to do is chase things and kill.
*  And you never get to chase things.
*  You never get to kill.
*  You just put it in a cage.
*  Yeah.
*  Every now and then they give you a beef leg to eat.
*  Expired meat from Walmart was what that guy was feeding them.
*  Bro.
*  And they're tearing this stuff apart and eating it but they never get to kill anything.
*  Yeah.
*  They want to kill things.
*  That's their nature.
*  You're robbing something of its nature.
*  It's like telling us we can't do stand up.
*  Telling somebody you can't do the thing you enjoy.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  When you're built to do.
*  Don't touch your penis.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't touch your penis.
*  You're telling them not to do things they want to do.
*  And for a cat, it's like you're never giving them that.
*  There's a reason why cats exist.
*  Right.
*  They're big and they're 100% carnivorous.
*  They're very, very, very fast.
*  Well why would nature create something like that?
*  Why would nature allow something like that?
*  Because there's too many of the other things.
*  How did the cat become domesticated?
*  Like how did it become the version that we have now?
*  Just like kind of a fat, lazy, nasty animal.
*  Good question.
*  When?
*  When did it become?
*  When did that?
*  Because didn't in ancient Egypt they worship cats?
*  Worshiped them.
*  Yeah.
*  Cats are very interesting.
*  But it's also, you know, they probably were amazed that cats would hang out with them.
*  I bet they were dealing with like servals and shit like that.
*  Those freaky cats that a lot of people keep as pets.
*  Yeah, cool cats.
*  The ones that are never really your pet.
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  Well the cat, you never own a cat.
*  Well you never own a cat.
*  Especially those.
*  Cats never care.
*  Those predatory looking serval things.
*  Yeah, the bangles and the servals.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  You had a bobcat in your yard.
*  Dude, just walking around.
*  Just walking around.
*  What are you doing that instant?
*  You don't care.
*  It's small.
*  My daughter took the photo.
*  I wasn't there.
*  Okay.
*  It wasn't that small.
*  I mean it was about 35 pounds.
*  Now did she send you the photo immediately?
*  Yeah, she sent me the photo.
*  And what do you do?
*  Do you go get inside?
*  Holy shit.
*  It was my older daughter.
*  So it wasn't.
*  But the, she's smart enough to know.
*  Staying in house.
*  Yeah.
*  But the thing about it is like they're always going to be around.
*  Like we live in LA.
*  If you live in LA, right?
*  If you're in the hills.
*  You think of hills.
*  That's the cat.
*  There he is.
*  That fucking thing.
*  It's cool looking.
*  Yeah.
*  If there's anywhere that has coyotes and everywhere has coyotes.
*  Everywhere.
*  Everywhere.
*  Burbank has coyotes.
*  Well, they can have bobcats too and they probably do.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's eagles.
*  There's all sorts of shit.
*  There's mountain lions.
*  Down by Malibu, that area.
*  Sure.
*  Like some of them.
*  Sure, dude.
*  There's, I mean, the thing about particularly like the whole Los Angeles area.
*  Pasadena has a problem with bears.
*  Bears going into people.
*  Really?
*  Yes, dude.
*  There's a great video of this guy walking down an alleyway on his phone in Pasadena.
*  I saw that.
*  And he's still there.
*  There's a fucking bear right in front of him.
*  Like a black bear.
*  Well, California's flag is the bear.
*  Well, that's actually a grizzly bear.
*  Interesting.
*  California used to have grizzly bears.
*  And the last grizzly bear was killed in Leveque or the last grizzly bear killed a person in Leveque,
*  California.
*  And it was named after the guy who was the last guy killed by a grizzly bear.
*  And they actually dug him up years later and found his bones were destroyed,
*  which was consistent with the grizzly bear attack.
*  Where is that?
*  Is that Northern California?
*  It's like, no, it's outside of Bakersfield.
*  Like on the, off the Five.
*  If you fed that bobcat, would it come back?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, people do.
*  Dummies.
*  Dummies feed him.
*  I know a dude, his wife feeds coyotes.
*  She leaves food out for them.
*  But a bobcat like that's fun.
*  They're both crazy.
*  Look at these bears in this guy's pool.
*  In California?
*  That's great.
*  Pasadena, they come down off the mountains.
*  Pasadena is pretty fucking close to the mountains.
*  So these are just regular bears, wild bears that live in fucking Pasadena.
*  And what's that sheriff going to do?
*  You're doing shit, bitch.
*  Pasadena has everything, man.
*  They got hawks, they got mountain lions, they got bears, and they have these like really nice.
*  I love those swimming.
*  Old houses.
*  Have you ever been to Pasadena?
*  It's beautiful.
*  Old Pasadena is amazing.
*  It's great.
*  What they say is, this is they, I don't know who they are, but they say that the Hollywood
*  fame people, the famous people in the early days of Hollywood.
*  Live there.
*  The actors lived in Hollywood Hills and the producers lived in Pasadena.
*  So they have these beautiful estates.
*  They're gorgeous.
*  They're old.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's like Hancock Park is kind of like that.
*  Have you ever been to Hancock Park?
*  Exactly like that.
*  Beautiful Hancock Park.
*  Yeah, it's really nice.
*  Yeah, but Pasadena is just, it's got a feel to it.
*  It's like, oh, wow.
*  This was like some crazy rich neighborhood.
*  It has that like stately feel of like an older, cool neighborhood.
*  Exactly.
*  A lot of people drive Mercedes Benz.
*  Yeah.
*  They're conservative with their money.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Those are, they pulled the lever for Reagan.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  They're liberal at parties, but not when they get in the booth.
*  Yes.
*  They just want to keep that money.
*  There's a lot of LA people like that.
*  There's a lot of those people.
*  They're woke in the boardroom, but then when they get in that booth, they pull the lever.
*  Dude, there's some closet conservatives.
*  Big time.
*  There's one, this one lady came up to my wife and wanted to talk to her about conservatism
*  because she thought that I was conservative for some reason.
*  And it was like, shh, you know, we're one too.
*  Yeah.
*  We're one of those too.
*  That's so funny.
*  Like no one wants to let anybody know.
*  Yeah, like they're vampires.
*  It's like half the country is conservative.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the, I don't know why she assumed that I was.
*  Well, you talk to anybody.
*  So you talk to people that you disagree with, you agree with, you have people on the show.
*  It's also the way I look.
*  I think that has.
*  Yeah, that's part of it too.
*  You don't have black-room glasses.
*  You're not a 95 pounds.
*  You're not afraid of saying hello to someone, but it's, it's the whole thing of having two
*  parties.
*  It's crazy.
*  And I think it might be ending.
*  I mean, not like the, the chaos of the moment necessitates solutions that aren't political.
*  Political solutions aren't going to work.
*  You kind of said it, we said pinning blame on everything like that.
*  The, the incentivizing of politicizing everything is not going to work.
*  We just need people that are intelligent.
*  And, and I think all the systems are, are whether it's technology, whether it's health,
*  it's not, the solutions are not political.
*  It's not electoral politics.
*  It's not elect a Senator.
*  It's not elect some idiot who convinced everybody in Texas to vote for him or people in Long
*  Island, New York to vote for him.
*  It's, it's finding that some of the people you've had on this show, people in that
*  echelon and putting them in a room and going, how the fuck are we going to figure this out?
*  It's not guys that convinced people in Virginia that they were, they had their best interest
*  at heart.
*  I mean, it's just an old system and it needs to be modernized.
*  You might, that's a really eloquent way of putting it.
*  Yeah.
*  You might have a good point there that hopefully like people recognize this is not serving
*  them to have these like rigid parties on one side and the other side.
*  And then we would, most people are way more nuanced.
*  And most people don't care.
*  They don't, most people are not a Republican or Democrat when they're out to dinner.
*  They want to have money.
*  They want jobs.
*  They want to be, you know, we just draw a line and say, you have to be this or that.
*  But especially now with all these different problems, your solutions are not going to
*  come from the two parties.
*  It also solidifies what's really important.
*  Like everyone says, well, you know, what's really important is family and love and right.
*  Guess what?
*  That is really what's really important.
*  It is.
*  Like it's not, that's not just rhetoric.
*  Yeah.
*  That's really important.
*  And you realize that when the shit hits the fan, like if you're wealthy and trapped in
*  a mansion by yourself and you don't have any friends.
*  Yes.
*  Can you imagine?
*  It's yeah, I could.
*  I'd love to imagine being trapped by myself in a mansion.
*  Can we arrange that?
*  How many days a week do you think you'd handle that?
*  Um, seven.
*  The thing is-
*  What would you do if no one could visit you?
*  Nobody liked you.
*  Well, no, I mean, listen, people are going to like you with a mansion.
*  That's the benefit of having a mansion.
*  People like you.
*  They tend to like you.
*  You have to be a real dick to not have friends in a mansion.
*  Especially if you have parties, right?
*  You have to be a real asshole for people to go, oh, that guy with the mansion, fuck him.
*  Let's go somewhere else.
*  So I get what you mean though.
*  Family.
*  I mean, listen, that stuff does, you know, listen, these are the things that are the,
*  you know, but not everybody has those luxuries.
*  Not everybody has that thing, you know?
*  It's true.
*  So there's a lot of people that devote their lives, you know, to other things or whatever.
*  And, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel bad for people that are working at places where they're exposed to this disease
*  and they're getting nothing for it.
*  So that's what I said earlier.
*  Like if you're working at a grocery store and it's like you're getting shit money
*  and you're being exposed to this, it's like we should do as a country,
*  we should do something for you.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  Maybe it's like, hey, man, you had a student loan.
*  We're taking care of it.
*  Or like, hey, you want a good interest rate on a mortgage five years from now,
*  we're doing it for you.
*  Like we got to do something for those people.
*  Right.
*  Because if your job used to be stacking apples, now your job is you could die.
*  Stacking apples.
*  Stacking apples.
*  There's got to be some way to because we're all depending on those supply
*  chains and those things being open.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you're putting meat in the package, if you're at Bristol Farms,
*  the store that I love, if you're doing whatever.
*  Is that your spot?
*  That's my spot.
*  I love it there.
*  It's just great.
*  It's just it's for new money.
*  It's for trash.
*  It's not like Airwon, which is for healthy people.
*  Bristol Farms is for millionaires that want Apple Jacks.
*  It's like, you know, it's like for, you know, TikTok people, rappers.
*  I saw a lady in Airwon.
*  She was dressed up like a hot beekeeper.
*  Yeah, that's what Airwon's all about.
*  Yeah.
*  She was so protected with the goggles and the mask.
*  Bristol Farms is like absurd.
*  It's like people pull up in Bentley's and get s'mores pie.
*  They have s'mores pie at Bristol Farms.
*  It's like, you got to be a real gutter trash, you know, but it's those people need some benefit.
*  So that's what I mean when I say it's a failure of the government.
*  It's not like it's not you can't pin it directly on Trump.
*  Everyone pins everything directly on Trump.
*  I don't think he's doing phenomenally, especially in communicating, he's doing what he does.
*  But I think the look at the system and you go, well, we just passed a $2 trillion bailout.
*  We're giving people $1,200.
*  That can't be the solution.
*  Well, anything he does that's really good gets minimized when he does something stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard for people to give him like the post about his ratings.
*  Yeah.
*  The post about his ratings during that it's beat the bachelor.
*  If that's not trolling, if that's not trolling, then it's real.
*  I don't know if it is trolling, but you can't do that when people are falling down dead.
*  It's crazy.
*  You can't do it.
*  It's a problem.
*  Anything good that he does, like closing off traffic to China early, you know, and deciding,
*  hey, listen, this travel to China is not smart.
*  Back and forth, we have to stop that.
*  And people are really upset at him.
*  That gets diminished by a tweet like that.
*  I think he wants people to like, I think he wants the media and Hollywood to like him.
*  I think that's what his supporters don't understand.
*  I think he actually is a creation of Hollywood.
*  All these people that are like Hollywood, Trump's taken on Hollywood.
*  It's like he's a creation of Hollywood.
*  This is a guy that loved the Clintons up until he ran against them.
*  Well, he was the host of a Hollywood television show.
*  So it's just convenient that he became this crusader against the elites that he spent
*  his entire life around.
*  Well, that was his point though.
*  His point was, I know what they actually do because I used to pay them.
*  A hundred percent.
*  I mean, that was a point that people bought in with.
*  They're like, oh yeah, this guy's going to fight on our behalf.
*  I've just never believed that about any politician because I'm an adult.
*  I think it's complicated like every.
*  Yeah.
*  You almost need a guy like him today to show that a guy like him can get through.
*  Sure.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like to understand the frailty of the system.
*  Yes.
*  Somebody has to exploit it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, they hire those hackers to like test your.
*  Yes, you can get through or they give a guy a gun at the airport and go, can you get through?
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, hackers, it's a famous thing that companies will do.
*  They'll hire hackers to try to break into their software to find out what are our vulnerabilities.
*  It's just, this is a weird thing to run a simulation.
*  During a pandemic, it might not be the idea to run a simulation with a guy and be like,
*  hey, let's see.
*  I don't think it's a simulation.
*  No, I'm not kidding.
*  I'm this guy, you're the exploit.
*  But now we know the exploit.
*  Look, having a popularity contest to see who controls the nukes is crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  Especially because we're frivolous.
*  Yeah.
*  What do we pay more attention to?
*  The Kardashians.
*  Who's right?
*  And I got to be honest with you.
*  They won't like if Kim Kardashian would make a better president than a lot of people,
*  a lot of people in Congress.
*  And that's how that's how crazy it's gotten.
*  That's how crazy that she's not the worst out there.
*  She's not the worst.
*  She's not the worst.
*  She's not the worst.
*  She's a businesswoman.
*  She's smart.
*  She's working for prison reform.
*  She's doing things.
*  Yeah.
*  She goes to Trump and helps people get out of jail that are unjustly imprisoned.
*  That's great.
*  She has for many, many people right now.
*  That's pretty cool.
*  I think it sounds like more than 18 people have been released because of Kim Kardashian.
*  I think it's crazy.
*  Kim, I'll go with you.
*  If you want to go to the White House.
*  I'll tag along.
*  I want to see you with a MAGA hat on.
*  I will go there.
*  When you wear a MAGA hat?
*  Yeah, I'll wear any hat.
*  Do you think that would ruin your Hollywood career?
*  I don't think I have a Hollywood.
*  If I have a Hollywood career, someone let me know.
*  Someone email me or call if I have a Hollywood career.
*  You don't want one.
*  Yeah, my career is in my apartment.
*  That's better.
*  That's the reality.
*  My career is a microphone.
*  I get to say what I want.
*  I would like to be an extra in Curb Your Enthusiasm.
*  I could do something very funny on a show like that.
*  I guess Larry David has a show where he wore a MAGA hat so people wouldn't talk to him.
*  That's a great episode.
*  That's one of the really funny, great shows out there.
*  Oh, it's a brilliant show.
*  But there's only a few of those that are really that good and there's a lot of garbage.
*  Who is an open Trump fan that's popular other than Kanye?
*  Got a lot of guys sports, right?
*  Guys like Tom Brady and stuff.
*  Yeah, Tom Brady.
*  They all catch shit for it.
*  As far as Hollywood, it's Clint Eastwood.
*  Oh, is he?
*  Yeah, I would imagine.
*  I think he said things.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  But he's certainly a Republican.
*  He's known for being a Republican.
*  Do you remember when Clint had that thing where he pretended that Obama was sitting
*  next to him and he had a conversation with him?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It was a chair, right?
*  He was talking to an empty chair.
*  What?
*  I think a lot of studios.
*  There's probably a lot of...
*  It's just crazy.
*  Imagine if you did that and I said, hey, Tim, what'd you do last night?
*  They put me in a hospital.
*  Well, I went to the Republican convention and they had me stand on a podium and I just
*  pretended that Obama was sitting next to me.
*  You spoke to a chair.
*  And I just had...
*  Well, someone's got it, but nobody has the balls to go up to Clint Eastwood and go,
*  let's not do this.
*  Yeah, what are you doing?
*  Let's not do this, Clint.
*  But what kind of a ridiculous proposition is that to pretend to have a conversation
*  with someone and then you make up their answers?
*  Just like it was the same reason that Gal Gadot and all those people were like,
*  let's sing Imagine and no one said, guys, this is the worst idea ever.
*  I think Republican operatives put them up to that.
*  If I was a Republican operative, I'd call Gal Gadot and I'm like,
*  why don't you get a bunch of people to sing Imagine?
*  Just walk by her.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we need right now.
*  There's a lot of celebrities now.
*  You can see how I had to touch some of the markets.
*  They're quarantining in mansions and they're like, just use this time to breathe.
*  Just be and just be okay with the silence.
*  Cook, nourish yourself.
*  I'm like, people are jumping out of windows.
*  Nobody has any fucking money, you psychopaths.
*  Just take this time to do yoga, to breathe.
*  The earth is repairing itself.
*  I love those people, the environmentalists were like, the earth is repaired.
*  The air in Los Angeles is so clear.
*  You're going to clearly see stabbings very soon.
*  Lex Friedman put out an Instagram post a few days ago explaining how many different viruses
*  are currently in contention right now in a world war that is happening inside of all mammals.
*  I love that you're looking for more terrifying news.
*  He was just saying, there's wars going on.
*  Here it is.
*  Look at this tweet.
*  There are 320,000 plus distinct viruses in mammals and a hundred million plus invertebrates,
*  invertebrates and plants.
*  There's an epic microscopic world war going on all around us and inside us.
*  Nature is beautiful and horrifying.
*  Sorcerer Anthony et al.
*  Viral diversity in mammals.
*  It's on Lex Friedman, Lex Friedman, his Instagram.
*  Lex who's been on the podcast a bunch of times is a genius and he's oddly fascinated by that.
*  How old is that guy?
*  He's like a young guy, right?
*  He's pretty young, he's in his 30s.
*  And he's like, yeah, he's like.
*  He's a fucking genius.
*  How depressing.
*  Stop with spending time with viruses.
*  But we need to know.
*  This is what it is.
*  Do we?
*  No, we do.
*  We thought we were okay.
*  I think, I mean, we're going to come out of this with a better understanding of the landscape.
*  100%.
*  I think that's the only good that I see.
*  We need to be silly and fun and stupid and people need to not every day look at models.
*  Everyone's like the new model says the old model.
*  It's like, dude, unless it's a real, like it's something that we need to do to stay safe,
*  you don't inundate yourself with coverage.
*  Unless it's my podcast.
*  There's a reality of any time there's a disaster is that some people can't keep the shit together.
*  And you find it during disasters.
*  And one thing that you do find is that there's going to be people that make too much noise.
*  Meaning they complain too much and they're freaking out too much and they make the experience bad
*  for other people.
*  Right.
*  And that's always been a problem with human beings.
*  It's just we had the world set up so easy that they were never tested before.
*  Now virtually everyone on the planet is tested with a new form of adversity
*  and a new thing that induces anxiety.
*  So these are new things.
*  And we're expecting people that are kind of weak to handle new things.
*  And when I'm being mean, I'm weak.
*  I mean, psychologically weak.
*  There's certain people that they're prone to indulgence.
*  They want too much attention for their sorrow and their anxiety.
*  They complain too much.
*  They're annoying to people and they exist.
*  Well, they have those people are another thing that we have to consider.
*  That they're dealing with an unprecedented amount of stress.
*  We're expecting them to handle it.
*  But I think it's like people like our job is to kind of if we can make this funny,
*  if we can show that it is dark, but I make fun of dark stuff.
*  So that's cool.
*  That's fine.
*  For me, I just think the challenge here is to just go keep being funny.
*  Be funny throughout.
*  And then when you're able to get back on stage and be funny, you'll be okay.
*  Have fun.
*  Yeah.
*  You'll be okay.
*  But if you curl up in a ball or you just give in to the temptation to be all doom and gloom,
*  I'm doom gloom plus funny.
*  You can be doom gloom and funny.
*  I don't think we necessarily have to be doom gloom.
*  We got to be realistic.
*  And even as shit stands right now with this disease going on,
*  it's still the best time to live human beings have ever experienced.
*  Well, until next month with the Great Depression.
*  But listen, what do you think?
*  You just told me to buy a gun an hour ago.
*  It's the best time to live.
*  You definitely should have more than one.
*  Yeah, you should have a couple of guns.
*  Okay, that's a good point.
*  Yeah, and boxes of bullets.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a good time to live, but you need weaponry.
*  I read about a house party in Bakersfield.
*  If you rob my apartment, you're...
*  Yeah.
*  People got together.
*  They had a house party in Bakersfield and someone fired off 94 shots and shot six people.
*  So imagine 94 shell casings they found.
*  See if you can find the story.
*  These are the type of people that are going to break quarantine.
*  And these are human beings.
*  But overall, you have to be impressed with the compliance.
*  Everybody's basically doing the same thing.
*  We're just staying at home and going to the grocery store and staying at home.
*  Also, people are becoming rats.
*  People are calling the cops.
*  I'm like, there's people that are calling the cops.
*  I'm like, kids walking too close together and shit.
*  I don't like when people become rats.
*  Well, Garcetti is offering rewards.
*  Yeah, I don't like that.
*  Did you see that?
*  Yeah, I don't like that.
*  They're offering rewards.
*  I think that's a whole other bigger problem.
*  Are your neighbors hugging you?
*  Yeah.
*  Turn them in.
*  Dude, I don't like how humanity so easily snaps into just informing on people.
*  I don't love that.
*  I think that's something in us that I hate.
*  I'm real nervous that we're going to have to have the antibodies in us
*  in order to be able to go places.
*  That's not going to work because I don't think a huge percentage of us have had this virus.
*  No, I don't think it's going to be like that.
*  I think they're going to either have a vaccine or have some sort of antibody that they can give you.
*  So you're going to need that plasma transfusion thing.
*  I'm not worried.
*  I think I beat it.
*  I think I had it.
*  I think my system.
*  We're going to find out.
*  Bro, you keep saying this.
*  Well, I'm going to feel like a goof in 23 minutes.
*  I'm confident because what if I had it?
*  Okay, I'm going to go congratulations.
*  What if I beat it?
*  That's wild.
*  Well, a few of my friends have beat it.
*  Like I said, Michael Yeo, my friend Sturgill Simpson, he's got it right now.
*  Yeah.
*  His wife doesn't have it.
*  His kids don't have it.
*  And he got it in Europe weeks ago.
*  Weird.
*  It's strange, man.
*  It's weird, man.
*  It's weird.
*  I'm very excited to find out.
*  I hope if I do have them, I want it to be like a ceremonial.
*  Imagine a strange virus like that, though, that gets into some people and does nothing
*  and other people devastates them.
*  And devastates mostly older people, but occasionally, occasionally.
*  Well, you know what it is, dude, if you were to design a bio weapon, like, you know,
*  a psychological weapon, this is psychological.
*  I don't think it's an effective bio weapon in the sense that it doesn't kill enough people.
*  But it is.
*  Not only that, it kills everybody.
*  But it's like it's going to kill you too.
*  It's going to kill your family.
*  But it's a very effective psychological weapon because you don't know who it's going to kill.
*  Well, you could say.
*  Terrifying.
*  But you could also say, like, what if you knew that it was coming so you protected
*  yourself and your loved ones with some medicine that only you knew?
*  And then you release this shit and you watch it wreak havoc.
*  And then when the stock market crashes, you start buying up stocks.
*  Yeah.
*  And you just start speculating.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's just, again, it's very it's it's it comes on the heels in China of some massive protests.
*  Yeah.
*  Not only China, but all around the world.
*  Do you imagine if one day we find out that they released an artificially created virus
*  to cause a world pandemic so they can get out of some political shit?
*  That'd be great.
*  Imagine.
*  Not great, but it'd be amazing.
*  Imagine if there was a nation that was that evil, that really I'm not saying they did.
*  Yeah.
*  Definitely not.
*  I think it'd be almost bigger than a nation.
*  Imagine how crazy that would be if something like that did.
*  Yeah, it could happen.
*  And I think it would be bigger than a nation.
*  It would probably be some of the most powerful people ever.
*  I mean, I think that would be bigger than one nation.
*  That might be a lot of different people going, listen, man, we just gotta.
*  Look, if you were China and you were evil, I'm not saying China's evil, but if you were,
*  let's just say we're in a movie.
*  Let's not even call it China.
*  Let's call it the Dark Land.
*  Trump is going to start calling it the Dark Land very soon.
*  And they decided to release a virus that kills a gigantic chunk of the population,
*  causes everyone to stay home, causes the market to collapse, and then dive in and start buying up
*  giant chunks of the businesses, control these businesses.
*  It's crazy.
*  It could absolutely happen.
*  And we wouldn't know and you wouldn't be able to prove it and it would take a while to find out,
*  even though China is now suppressing research into the origins of the virus,
*  which is not a good sign.
*  And that doctor disappeared.
*  Dude, none of these things are good.
*  None of these are good.
*  But I'm not worried.
*  You should be terrified.
*  Why are you not worried?
*  Because you gotta be a fatalist at a certain point.
*  If I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.
*  That's what it is.
*  You gotta be a fatalist at a certain point.
*  It's not like a cowboy.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm very zen.
*  If you're gonna go, you're gonna go.
*  You know, one of my friends was on a flight and was about to, he was sitting next to somebody,
*  funny guy, a comedian, a dance teacher, he was sitting there and he was working on a show and
*  there's a producer behind him and he's sitting there, the plane's really rocky, it's getting
*  really bad, it's stormy and he goes, you know, whatever happens, I had a good life.
*  And the woman behind the producer goes, no, you haven't.
*  Great.
*  It's great.
*  No, you haven't.
*  She goes, no, you haven't.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Do you know how many people work with someone they hate?
*  How many people work with someone that they think is really fucking annoying and they just can't?
*  A lot of people.
*  It's a lot of people.
*  There's no choice.
*  You gotta do it.
*  You gotta show it.
*  Now you work with somebody you hate and they're coughing.
*  Imagine that.
*  Now your coworker's coughing.
*  Oh my God.
*  And you're like, you're like, I think Cynthia's got the bug.
*  That dry cough.
*  Dude.
*  It's gotta be terrifying to hear that next year.
*  You're working and all you hear is that's gotta be crazy.
*  You'd be so angry.
*  You'd be mad.
*  She get more sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  Why didn't she take vitamin C?
*  Yeah.
*  No one's thinking like that, but they're all.
*  I love it.
*  He thinks everyone's like so healthy.
*  Why didn't you wash your hands?
*  Yeah.
*  Why didn't she go to the sauna?
*  No, everyone's like, fuck that bitch.
*  I'm glad she's dead.
*  I'm getting out of here before I start coughing.
*  You know, it's a tough, it's, it's tough.
*  The idea that you could take a bunch of people like in a workplace, 20 people,
*  and you just make them become friends.
*  It's crazy.
*  You have to work together every day.
*  If you're in an office of 20 people and you see insane people every day,
*  they have to be your friends.
*  Well, that's what like all those elite fraternities like skull and bones and shit.
*  The challenge of them is you take 20 people you think are going to be leaders and they
*  don't know each other at all.
*  And you force them to have this lifelong bond.
*  How do you do that?
*  You do it by like making them do embarrassing shit in front of each other.
*  That's the whole thing of like why those institutions exist.
*  Or like Harvard and Yale, all those places that are just take very successful people
*  that have, you know, potential to be future leaders and be influential people and like
*  mold them together and force them to create very close bonds.
*  That's what all those secret societies of fraternities.
*  That's what all that stuff's about.
*  So it's very interesting.
*  That's what elite power circles have done forever.
*  That's the whole point of any of those things is to just create bonds between people that
*  have no idea that each other existed before they wake up next to each other in coffins
*  or whatever.
*  Well, the thing that people are always talking about when it comes to conspiracy theories
*  about depopulation of the planet.
*  Yeah.
*  It's always like the elites are going to depopulate the planet and they're going to kill,
*  you know, 50% of the population and then they're going to take over and control things.
*  And it sounds ridiculous, right?
*  It sounds ridiculous.
*  Until they have the robots.
*  Or you have a virus.
*  Right.
*  Because they don't have the robots yet.
*  They still need us to pick berries and shit.
*  When they have the robots, all bets are off.
*  Once AI advances to that level, once you see the self-driving cars and all that stuff,
*  once you walk into a bank and a robot's like, hello, Mr. Rogan.
*  Then you're like, oh yeah, we're going soon.
*  They're going to start stuffing bats and chickens and yeah.
*  I think we might not get to that.
*  No.
*  I think if this, if this symbolizes the new normal and then this is,
*  this is like where we're going to realize that these things are around us and there are
*  hundreds and millions of them and they're, they're constantly morphing and evolving.
*  Then you just live in terror.
*  Yeah.
*  But maybe that's just what the future is.
*  Maybe we live like mice, you know?
*  That's not even a life though.
*  Terror.
*  But that's not a life.
*  There's a lot of rats.
*  That's not a life.
*  You see that thing that I sent you about rats in New York?
*  Yeah.
*  I woke up to it.
*  I woke up, he texted me like, he texted me there, rat wars in New York.
*  I looked outside.
*  It was beautiful.
*  I'm like, fuck New York.
*  Fuck those people.
*  Fuck those comedy purists over there in New York.
*  Now they're living in a, in a, in a post-apocalyptic hellscape where rats are fighting each other.
*  Well, they, they, they, you know, when I say go do this guy's podcast, they go,
*  I wouldn't do a YouTuber's podcast.
*  I'm like, you're an idiot.
*  Some of those people are stupid.
*  Oh, so they think they just want to do stand up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Those people.
*  So I'm like, you know, not all of them, listen, the funniest people in the world,
*  you know, were from the East coast, are from the East coast, but you know,
*  sometimes you can be a little, you can be a little shortsighted.
*  Well, I think there, and there's some, the thing about podcasts is there's so many of them.
*  So you go, well, what is a podcast?
*  Is it like this really horrible one that I don't want to listen to?
*  Or is it like, you know, fucking some really interesting, well-produced,
*  Wander show?
*  Right.
*  What is it?
*  What is a podcast?
*  How is it, how is it what I do?
*  And also what Dan Carlin does?
*  How the fuck are those the same things?
*  They're not really.
*  They're not.
*  But what's interesting is like, it's just the edge.
*  You've always made this point about comedy.
*  You've said comedy is so many different things, right?
*  That's why you have Nanette and then you have whatever else.
*  Like you have some, yeah, you have the full spectrum of they look similar,
*  but you have the full spectrum.
*  The same clothes.
*  Very much so.
*  So that's the whole thing.
*  So I think with podcasting, it's just, it's not even a thing.
*  It's just like, it's just a platform.
*  It's a technology that allows everybody to do whatever they want.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like having an Instagram page.
*  Like my Instagram page is very different than Delia's,
*  which is very different than Kyle Dunningan's.
*  It's like everybody's got a different thing that they're doing with it.
*  And what a podcast allows you to do, it allows you to do like a show or a thing
*  without having anybody else tell you what to do.
*  Right.
*  That's exactly it.
*  And it allows you to think about what you're doing.
*  Who the fuck would ever tell you that's a good thing to do?
*  No one would ever tell me anything I've done is a good thing to do my whole life.
*  No one would have ever looked at anything I've said and said,
*  no, do that.
*  That's a great investment.
*  That house, especially like a podcast though, right?
*  Like, what do you want to do?
*  You just do plan the sound.
*  Yeah, no, I just rant.
*  I just go, I just go about things I care about.
*  They go get out of here.
*  They go get out of here.
*  That's psychotic.
*  I can't bring this to the producers.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, this is not going to work.
*  This is what people in mental institutions do.
*  You think I'm going to bring that to network?
*  That's your idea.
*  Right.
*  You're going to talk.
*  How are we going to sell that to Quibi?
*  That thing's about to go bye bye bye.
*  Well, listen, it's a mobile streaming app that they launched during a pandemic when
*  most people are like watching TV on their couch going, yeah, I'm not commuting anymore.
*  It's a good time for some things though.
*  Not that thing.
*  What if it's got a big audience right out of the gate with some high profile guests?
*  Yeah, I'm sure the 30 million unemployed people are going to be there tomorrow,
*  keep buying it.
*  They're in a little bit of trouble.
*  And I don't have the facts to back that up, but I would, and I don't have the stocks,
*  certs, but I'm telling you right now, if I were them, I'd start preparing alternate strategies.
*  What's an alternate strategy?
*  You know, it's backed by big people, you know, Meg Whitman, Randy Bay, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
*  and Randy Dreamworks.
*  They advertise on the podcast.
*  And they're brilliant people and I love their friends of mine.
*  I hang out at their house.
*  I'm best friends with both of them.
*  Really?
*  But when I watched a Quibi launch thing, yeah, we hang out all the time.
*  When I watched a Quibi launch thing, they spent a lot of that thing talking about how the movie
*  looks different if you hold it like this and you hold it like that because it, the picture
*  switches when you go like this and like that.
*  And I'm like, if that's 50% of the reason I need to have your thing, we're in deep trouble.
*  Deep, deep trouble.
*  I mean, that's just, you know, edit that all out.
*  The point is, but you know what I mean?
*  It's like, you know, it would have been a great idea in a world where everybody's maybe
*  commuting all the time.
*  This world, even when we come back, dude, a lot of people are going to be staying at home.
*  A lot of companies are going to go, you're not essential.
*  We don't need you in the office.
*  Yes.
*  You can stay home.
*  No, I think for sure.
*  Meetings are happening now.
*  Isn't it weird that it's like really good for some things like Netflix?
*  Great.
*  Great for that.
*  It's great for that.
*  Great for podcasts.
*  Great for podcasts.
*  Great for what else?
*  What else is great?
*  Terrible for sports.
*  Terrible for sports.
*  Of anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Terrible for sports.
*  Terrible for live entertainment.
*  Terrible for anything that, you know, festivals and concerts and things like that.
*  You know, live events, you know, live podcast.
*  Kill Tony is the biggest live podcast in the world.
*  Can't do it.
*  It's hard for that.
*  Things like that.
*  But what it is good for is for streaming services, for content, for online podcasts,
*  things like that.
*  You know, probably for, you know, for, you know, these networks and apps that allow you
*  to communicate with a lot of people at once, like things like Zoom, you know, these things
*  are, these things are going to be big.
*  Probably too big for Zoom.
*  Right?
*  That was the problem.
*  Yeah.
*  Then, you know, there's probably going to be some things that go by the wayside because
*  of this.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this might kill movie theaters.
*  This is good.
*  Well, I read an article by AMC that said that they may not reopen.
*  They've been downgraded from like bad to like fucked.
*  Yeah, I read that too.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're in trouble.
*  But it's also a lot of people would like to just be able to get the movies at home.
*  Yeah, no one cares.
*  And the way they're doing it with Apple, it's kind of forced their hand.
*  So Apple's got like on iMovie or i, what is it?
*  iHome, iTV?
*  What is it?
*  Some people, but they're living in a horror show.
*  So when they try to watch a movie, it's like someone's giving birth in the next room.
*  So the problem is some people go to the movie theater as an escape.
*  Right.
*  So the reality is, depending on how much, you know, it's like you're sitting on the
*  couch, your grandmother's dying of corona.
*  You're like, I'm trying to watch a film here and this bitch is hacking her lung up in my
*  house.
*  So some people need those things.
*  Yeah.
*  Movie, I think something will come back to it or some, it'll be some hipster bullshit
*  thing that it'll go away for a few years and they'll bring it back.
*  Like remember this.
*  Well, those are the ones when you go to a town, you have like a local movie theater
*  with a real butter on the popcorn and shows in Bozeman, Montana.
*  We saw back to the future.
*  That's great.
*  Back to the future in the movie theater.
*  So it's like, this is amazing.
*  It's like one of those, but the seats suck, right?
*  No, they were good.
*  Okay.
*  Drive-ins could come back.
*  People have been like, oh, good.
*  Good call.
*  Jamie comes back.
*  Good call.
*  A lot of hand jobs.
*  1950s, 1950s drive-in.
*  How many people got jerked off at a drive-in?
*  A lot.
*  That's a number that's like almost uncountable.
*  It's crazy.
*  Like 80% of the people were getting jerked off.
*  At drive-ins.
*  If they saw a movie there, they got jerked off 80% of the time.
*  That's so funny.
*  It's so funny now how violent movies are getting jerked off to just a violent film.
*  You know, just a horrific, just 12 years of slave and you're getting jerked off.
*  It's like, God, this is rough.
*  Got to do what you got to do.
*  That's the way it is.
*  Just got to do it.
*  I'm, you know, I'm cautiously optimistic.
*  I'm curious.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm curious how this is going to go down.
*  I think you made a good point.
*  It makes me think about health differently and the necessity of like really trying to turn,
*  you know, take care of myself better because you want to be able to fight these things off.
*  Think about it like the three little pigs.
*  You don't want a house made of straw.
*  Thank you very much.
*  You don't want a house made of sticks.
*  You want to house made of bricks.
*  That's a good point.
*  I've never read that.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Three little pigs.
*  The wolf blows the house down.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So what it is is the idea to protect yourself from a wolf bitch, make a real fucking house.
*  But if I have those antibodies, it means that I got bricks.
*  Maybe.
*  And that's crazy.
*  Maybe it comes back.
*  We don't know what this fucking thing is.
*  We don't know.
*  We don't even know if it's real.
*  It's probably not real.
*  It's 5G.
*  You got to burn in 5G towers.
*  These fucking morons.
*  What is 5G?
*  I don't even know what 5G is.
*  It's a higher speed internet.
*  It's a new bandwidth.
*  You don't think there could be some issues with that?
*  I think there could be.
*  Right.
*  But it's a new thing.
*  So when you have video files you have to download, they download like,
*  like I'm flying in, man.
*  I just know that everybody, everything's like, everything is one conspiracy now.
*  Everything's like, it's Knight's Templar and 5G.
*  And I'm like, guys, wait a minute.
*  My phone is 5G.
*  I never used it once.
*  I have a Galaxy Note that has 5G.
*  I've never got to 5G once.
*  I have Sprint.
*  I don't even have any of the Gs.
*  I have like, though it's the most embarrassing service.
*  Sprint is for people who have no control over their own life.
*  Is that true?
*  It's a bad service.
*  It's not good.
*  Verizon and AT&T are for legit people.
*  AT&T is sketchy.
*  Yeah, but-
*  It's not for people who like to talk on the phone.
*  The good thing about AT&T is you can pretend your signal sucks.
*  You can go like, I'm on AT&T, sorry.
*  Be like, I gotta go.
*  Yeah.
*  Verizon seems to be able to hold more power.
*  Verizon's the one that everyone has.
*  But the fact that there's dead spots anywhere in 2020, fuck you.
*  In China, you could be on the top of a mountain in the middle of nowhere,
*  and you get five bars.
*  Those motherfuckers are wired.
*  I know, but 21 million people lost those cell phones on the mountain.
*  I know.
*  They lost those phones.
*  Goodbye.
*  Well, tell them what it is.
*  It's 21 million cell phone subscribers are just-
*  That are no longer online.
*  Yeah.
*  So that means, and cell phones are a way to track people in China.
*  So the government loves people having them.
*  Yeah.
*  So the idea that 21 million disappeared might suggest that the death toll is higher.
*  Or the other option was they were saying what it also could be would be that a lot of people
*  had two lines, and then with the pandemic hit, they lost the ability to hold two lines.
*  Yeah.
*  Didn't have the money for it anymore, so they canceled one of the lines.
*  It also feels like there's a group of people that are trying to push the war with China
*  narrative.
*  You start to feel that.
*  You start to feel people are like, hey, maybe let's, hey, let's, they're the enemy.
*  Let's fight them.
*  And it's like, they probably are the enemy, but do we need a war now?
*  Right.
*  Of course we don't need a war.
*  But we don't need a war with China.
*  We don't need a war with China right now.
*  That's a real war.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's just take a break.
*  Yeah.
*  A war with China is not like a war with Afghanistan.
*  No, that's a serious war.
*  Yeah.
*  We don't need that.
*  With an army that's huge and super powerful and has nuclear weapons.
*  And just, let's just pretend they did light those people on fire that were sick.
*  Hey.
*  If they did, imagine what they'll do to you.
*  Everybody makes mistakes.
*  Imagine what they'll do to you if they eat dogs.
*  If I was in a closed door meeting and they said, we torched 20 million of our people,
*  I'd go, hey, this is the way you do it.
*  Do you really want to fuck with people who eat bats?
*  No.
*  I don't think you do.
*  No.
*  You're dealing with a billion of them too.
*  Let's just let them do their thing.
*  Let's do our thing.
*  We don't need a war.
*  I don't need to go there and eat a bat.
*  Well, it's also, they're already, they're imprisoned by their government.
*  It's such a, we're not against Chinese people.
*  No.
*  No one is.
*  And I'm not even saying I'm against the Chinese government.
*  I'm saying that the Chinese government is for sure a dictatorship.
*  They're an authoritarian government.
*  But we don't want to tell people what to do.
*  We can slide in that direction in America.
*  I'm just saying what it is.
*  It is what it is.
*  I think the worry is that people call that out, which is true,
*  but they also should realize we can slide there here.
*  This is my point has always been that we're human beings just like them
*  and they are doing it that way where they have a dictatorship
*  that tells them what to do in 2020.
*  There's no difference between them and us.
*  It's just they're in a different part of the world.
*  Right.
*  But that could be us.
*  Could be us.
*  Got to be careful.
*  Yeah.
*  We got to be real careful.
*  Got to be careful, man.
*  Especially right now.
*  Because those rights, they slip away, they chip away.
*  And then you never get them back.
*  Right.
*  And you know, Michael Shermer and I were having the conversation about
*  being able to talk to people that you don't agree with and how important that is.
*  Yeah.
*  He wrote a book about giving the devil his due.
*  Like being able to talk to people they disagree with.
*  Well, this is all this is what this all relates to this kind of this thing that's going on here.
*  There's got to be open discourse.
*  Right.
*  They can't shut down.
*  Absolutely.
*  Where you go.
*  No.
*  They can't shut down what you do.
*  You have to have freedom.
*  Because if you don't have freedom, then you can tell me what to do for some strange reason.
*  You can be a person that decides to tell me what to do.
*  I don't want that.
*  That's why we started this country in the first place.
*  Like if we're going to slide towards safety so hard.
*  That's why you got to deal with people's opinions online that you don't like
*  because they have the right to express them.
*  That's why I've always been like people say things all the time.
*  I think that's abhorrent.
*  But they should have the right to post it on.
*  My aunt should have the right to use her Facebook page.
*  You know.
*  Why not?
*  Even though I think she should be in jail.
*  I mean, the problem is also the people don't want people being influenced by
*  people that are full of shit.
*  Right.
*  Like preachers or televangelists.
*  Hucksters.
*  Hucksters.
*  They don't want but I'm not getting influenced by them and you're not either.
*  No.
*  So it doesn't work on people that are paying attention.
*  So we're going to protect people that don't pay attention.
*  And then the Hucksters.
*  Are we doing that?
*  We're not protecting young people.
*  Okay.
*  If we're protecting young people, how young?
*  When I was 21, you couldn't have caught me with that stupid shit.
*  But here's the other thing.
*  Those Hucksters and preachers will just get better.
*  So you can box them out.
*  They'll just evolve and their messages will get, you know, they'll figure out a way.
*  The people that are going to get duped, they're going to get duped.
*  They're going to get duped.
*  They're going to get fucked.
*  That's part of the problem.
*  I was always going to buy that house because I'm an idiot.
*  You were young too.
*  I was young and it was fun.
*  But isn't that a part of what we need to see around us too?
*  You need to see failure.
*  You need to, you cannot, you can't, as you've said, like nerf the world.
*  You can't make it safe for everybody.
*  People got to deal with things and learn how to deal with them.
*  Get armor, get immunity and the quarantine.
*  Send us back out today.
*  Gavin Newsom, send us out right now.
*  I got antibodies.
*  I don't care.
*  We're going to find out in three minutes.
*  Three minutes.
*  We're going to find out what they're doing.
*  Does he come here?
*  Do we have to go?
*  Yeah.
*  No, he's here already.
*  This is great.
*  So he's just sitting out there with a needle.
*  Yeah, they're ready.
*  They're sharpening up their needles and getting out the alcohol pads.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  This is wild.
*  Going to find out what's up.
*  I'm excited.
*  I hope I don't have shit.
*  I bet I don't either.
*  You never even got a cold.
*  I bet I don't.
*  I need to test you for being a pussy.
*  It's green light.
*  I was sick.
*  All right.
*  Shall we wrap it up?
*  Yes.
*  Thank you.
*  Tim Dillon.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much.
*  Always fun.
*  Tell everybody your podcast.
*  The Tim Dillon Show.
*  It's a fact-free zone.
*  Come there.
*  And Tim J. Dillon on D-I-L-L-O-N on Instagram and Twitter.
*  It's a lot of fun over there.
*  Woo.
*  Thank you, folks.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks, everybody.
*  Bye.
*  Fun.
*  I hope I get fucking this clean deal of help.
*  I know I'm not.
*  You know what?
