# Joe Rogan Experience #2096 - Josh Dubin & Sheldon Johnson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6.0s)]
*  Okay, Mr. Dugan, good to see you again, sir. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=10.0s)]
*  Mr. Rogan. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=16.0s)]
*  Always, always a pleasure. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=17.0s)]
*  Introduce your friend. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=19.0s)]
*  This is my friend, my client, my brother, Sheldon Johnson. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=21.0s)]
*  I figured we'd do something a little bit different. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=26.0s)]
*  Typically, the person sitting to my right is someone that was wrongfully convicted. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=30.0s)]
*  So I don't want to bury the headline. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=37.0s)]
*  Sheldon is guilty. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=40.0s)]
*  And I thought it would be a real interesting conversation to learn his background, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=42.0s)]
*  learn about his upbringing, learn about the crime that he committed, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=53.0s)]
*  and hear the sentence he got, which I don't want to shade it and inject my opinion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=58.0s)]
*  I have a strong one, but it's pretty astounding how he was treated by the system. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=70.0s)]
*  I think that there's a real interesting twist that happens at his sentencing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=78.0s)]
*  And I know I've said this before, and it probably sounds repetitive, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=84.0s)]
*  but another miracle sitting to my right, just like a marvelous human being who was basically told by a judge, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=89.0s)]
*  by an African-American judge that you don't matter, you don't count, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=99.0s)]
*  and I'm going to throw your life away for a crime in which the victim received two stitches [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=104.0s)]
*  and on a second offense, his first offense being a gun possession charge. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=112.0s)]
*  So I will say this, that he received a sentence that far eclipses a sentence [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=120.0s)]
*  that would be commonly doled out for murder or manslaughter. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=127.0s)]
*  So with that, here's Sheldon. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=132.0s)]
*  Sheldon, how long have you been out for? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=136.0s)]
*  Going on nine months. I got out May 4th. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=138.0s)]
*  And you were in for 25 years and five months. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=142.0s)]
*  For two stitches. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=149.0s)]
*  Two stitches. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=150.0s)]
*  But one of the things that always struck me about Sheldon was I didn't know him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=154.0s)]
*  And I got a call from these two remarkable attorneys at an organization called the Center for Appellate Litigation, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=161.0s)]
*  Barbara Zolot and Allison Haupt, who had been working on this case for a long time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=168.0s)]
*  And they called me and Derek Hamilton and said, you know, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=174.0s)]
*  we know you're working on some stuff with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=180.0s)]
*  We have this case that has sort of hit a snag. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=184.0s)]
*  I want you to take a look at it and see if you could help us. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=187.0s)]
*  And I called Barbara back and said, I think I think that there's a mistake here because it says that he was sentenced to 50 years. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=192.0s)]
*  I mean, that's no bullshit. I could not believe what I was reading. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=203.0s)]
*  And then I read about what Sheldon had accomplished while in prison. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=206.0s)]
*  And then his earliest date of release was, I think, 2049. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=212.0s)]
*  And he had already served 25 years. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=216.0s)]
*  So I was just blown away by the level of accomplishment and the mental wherewithal that he possessed to accomplish what he did while incarcerated. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=221.0s)]
*  And then the path he's taken in the eight months since he's been out is it's it's we talk about [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=237.0s)]
*  on these episodes, how do you make change happen? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=245.0s)]
*  He's living it and making it happen. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=247.0s)]
*  So I thought it would be just fascinating to go through, like I said, his life, how he got to where he was, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=250.0s)]
*  why he got this, what his thoughts are and our thoughts are on the sentence he received, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=259.0s)]
*  why that happens too often to people of color. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=264.0s)]
*  And I know there's one thing I want to say, and I'm going to shut up and really let Sheldon talk and you talk. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=268.0s)]
*  I get I get this a lot. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=274.0s)]
*  Why are you always bringing up race when you talk about the system? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=277.0s)]
*  And my response to that is if you don't talk about how it impacts the system, even for people that have been found guilty, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=281.0s)]
*  it's like it's like having a conversation about President Biden and ignoring the very obvious apparent cognitive deficiencies he has. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=292.0s)]
*  It would be like talking about Donald Trump and not recognizing that he seems like an unhinged lunatic. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=305.0s)]
*  It would be like talking about Kamala Harris and ignoring that she didn't do much to advance criminal justice reform. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=315.0s)]
*  You have to confront it. It's just it's there. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=323.0s)]
*  Is it that all people that get wrongfully convicted are people of color? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=327.0s)]
*  No, but most of them. Is it that all people of color get disparate sentences? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=331.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=337.0s)]
*  So that's why I thought that this is an important conversation to have. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=340.0s)]
*  And getting to know Sheldon, just thought he he has a remarkable story to tell in a perspective on on his circumstances, the system. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=344.0s)]
*  And he's someone that's taken responsibility for what he did. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=353.0s)]
*  And I think is a living example of what can happen if we think long and hard about [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=357.0s)]
*  if someone's life is worth just throwing away and putting behind bars so that they can rot in a dank cell, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=365.0s)]
*  because he would have been 70 years old when he got out way past his life expectancy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=372.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things that's happened through all of our conversations that we've had on the show is it highlights how insanely broken the criminal justice system is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=379.0s)]
*  and how little oversight there is and how few people are looking at these individual cases and that you can have one judge who does what they did to you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=390.0s)]
*  And no one's looking. No one cares. No one pays attention. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=402.0s)]
*  And until someone like you goes in and starts combing over this and then coming up with a strategy for, you know, to actually apply real justice or at least get someone out of the way. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=406.0s)]
*  I mean, the only way to apply real justice is to have a fucking time machine. Right. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=420.0s)]
*  But it's broken. I mean, it's it's so broken and it seems so overwhelmed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=425.0s)]
*  And the root cause of it is never addressed. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=432.0s)]
*  The root cause of I mean, I've said it ad nauseum, but I'll say it again. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=436.0s)]
*  Where the fuck did we come up with a hundred and whatever billion dollars to send to Ukraine? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=442.0s)]
*  And we don't have any money to to try to do something about these insanely impoverished, crime-ridden, gang-ridden, drug-ridden communities. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=448.0s)]
*  We don't do anything. We have nothing. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=461.0s)]
*  I mean, this is my take on this whole make America great again thing. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=464.0s)]
*  You want to make America great again? Make it so there's less losers. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=468.0s)]
*  Make it so that more people have a fucking chance. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=472.0s)]
*  The idea that everyone starts on the same line. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=475.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not talking about equality of outcome. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=479.0s)]
*  That's not possible. But equality of opportunity is possible. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=483.0s)]
*  That's a possible goal. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=488.0s)]
*  At least we could advance that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=490.0s)]
*  At least we could do something to just change the course of who knows how many people's lives. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=492.0s)]
*  And we don't do a fucking thing about it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=501.0s)]
*  I mean, we're looking at each other because we just had we just like had lunch before we came. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=503.0s)]
*  It's like the precise conversation that we had. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=507.0s)]
*  I told you this is a motherfucker that gets it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=511.0s)]
*  Oh, I know. It just makes no sense to me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=514.0s)]
*  It makes no sense to me. And it's not a subject of any presidential debates. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=517.0s)]
*  It's not a subject of anybody who's running for Congress or run for Senate. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=521.0s)]
*  We have to fix this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=525.0s)]
*  This is a problem that's been going on for decades and decades back through Jim Crow, back all the way to slavery, the same same communities. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=526.0s)]
*  And we don't do anything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=534.0s)]
*  Pull that a little redlining everything. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=536.0s)]
*  Pull that mic up a little bit. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=539.0s)]
*  Yeah, just just that's good. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=541.0s)]
*  That's good. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=542.0s)]
*  I mean, it's wild. It really is wild. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=544.0s)]
*  And, you know, and the race part of it is a major factor. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=547.0s)]
*  It's a major factor. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=554.0s)]
*  And it's a factor that gets ignored when people start talking about racism, systemic racism in the country. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=556.0s)]
*  Talk about sentencing. How come that's not talked about? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=561.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's a vestige of that's a vestige of slavery. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah. Segregation. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=568.0s)]
*  Jim Crow, redlining everything. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=570.0s)]
*  Exercising your right to a jury trial. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=573.0s)]
*  Yeah. Being punished twice. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=575.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's hard to know where to pick up because we just had this conversation. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=577.0s)]
*  But you're you know, look, well, let's preface the the episode by saying this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=583.0s)]
*  We are doing something about it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=590.0s)]
*  I keep telling you that this this forum that keeps paying dividends, we are we are making progress. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=592.0s)]
*  We are opening people's minds. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=599.0s)]
*  I'm getting letters from prosecutors. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=601.0s)]
*  I'm getting letters from sheriffs. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=603.0s)]
*  I got a letter from a sheriff in Oregon last week, and he sent me a badge and said, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=605.0s)]
*  I want to show you how committed I am to trying to make change happen. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=613.0s)]
*  And it was from this show. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=617.0s)]
*  So we're doing it. We're addressing it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=619.0s)]
*  We're making it happen. Why politicians don't I you know, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=621.0s)]
*  what drives someone to want to get into politics these days is for a different psychiatrist. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=626.0s)]
*  Fucking I have no clue what the allure is. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=634.0s)]
*  But you know, like there's such a swirl of ego and power struggle and divided loyalties. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=638.0s)]
*  I can't even wrap my head around it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=645.0s)]
*  But you know, we're doing it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=647.0s)]
*  We're helping. We got to do it grain of sand by grain of sand until we have a sandcastle. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=649.0s)]
*  So that's what we're doing. So I do think we're making a difference. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=655.0s)]
*  But you know, it's crazy because she Sheldon and I are the same exact age. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=659.0s)]
*  And we didn't know that until we were on our way down days apart. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=664.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he he flew when we flew down. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=668.0s)]
*  It was the first time he'd ever been on an airplane. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=671.0s)]
*  Wow. What's that like? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=675.0s)]
*  Fucking weird, right? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=678.0s)]
*  I was it was I actually loved it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=680.0s)]
*  I was I was very excited. I'm kind of like an adrenaline. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=683.0s)]
*  I like the adrenaline rush, just the speed of it and just the whole idea of just you know, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=687.0s)]
*  I had this analogy in my head when I was up in the clouds and I'm looking down and I said to myself, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=694.0s)]
*  I said, I just came from the bowels of hell, spending 25 years in prison. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=701.0s)]
*  And now I'm in the sky above the clouds and the heavens, headed to a destination to talk about change [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=708.0s)]
*  and to talk about all of the things that brought me to this place today. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=717.0s)]
*  And, you know, the conditions in which I grew up and, you know, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=722.0s)]
*  how social conditions play a role in the decisions that we make or the lack of achievements or opportunities. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=726.0s)]
*  Like Joe just said a couple of minutes ago, you know, those opportunities are very important [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=733.0s)]
*  and being able to start that line where everybody is not necessarily equity, like equitable. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=737.0s)]
*  But, you know, everybody has that same opportunity. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=744.0s)]
*  You have a chance. You have a chance. Yeah. A real chance. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=747.0s)]
*  Well, so tell us about your upbringing. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=751.0s)]
*  So I'm a Coda. My mother's deaf. My father's deaf. My sister's deaf. My aunt is deaf. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=755.0s)]
*  I grew up in a deaf household. What's a Coda? A Coda is a child of deaf adults. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=761.0s)]
*  That's crazy. This is the second podcast in a row I'm doing with someone who's like that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=766.0s)]
*  Moshe Kasher, who was on yesterday, his parents are deaf. He signs and, you know, he's he had to translate for his mother his whole life. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=770.0s)]
*  Same with me. So as a child growing up, my mother's also white. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=778.0s)]
*  My grandmother came to America in 1918 from a boat from Sicily. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=782.0s)]
*  My father is Nigerian. He's African. So there was this always this contrast where, you know, I wasn't really sure where I belonged that, you know, kids are cruel. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=787.0s)]
*  So growing up, you know, kids would say, oh, you're a mulatto, you're a half breed and oh, you're adopted. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=797.0s)]
*  And for a long time, I kind of suffered as a child with an identity crisis, not really knowing where I fell at on either side, what my identity was, who I was supposed to be. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=804.0s)]
*  And my father, I'm also a product of intergenerational incarceration. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=815.0s)]
*  My father was incarcerated when I was young at an early age. He did about 15 years. I was incarcerated. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=820.0s)]
*  My grandfather was incarcerated. My great grandfather was a slave. And my son killed somebody when he was 12 years old. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=828.0s)]
*  So that there's this cycle of incarceration based on the conditions, the social conditions and where I come from. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=837.0s)]
*  I grew up in New York City, Harlem, on the borderline between the East Side and the West Side on Fifth Avenue. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=844.0s)]
*  You hear Fifth Avenue, you're like, oh, wow, you live in a nice place. OK. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=850.0s)]
*  Crack era Harlem, 80s, 90s. You know, and I grew up, you know, protecting my mother, interpreting for my mother. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=855.0s)]
*  My mother could hardly ever keep a job because of her handicap. There was always somebody that would replace her. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=863.0s)]
*  A lot of people saw my mother as a victim. She was a white woman in on 112th Street in Lenox Avenue, an all black community. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=869.0s)]
*  So as a child, I grew up protecting my mother. So I never really I feel like in hindsight, I didn't really have an opportunity to be a child. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=878.0s)]
*  I had to grow up and be a man early in my life in order to be able to protect my mother. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=888.0s)]
*  And a lot of people didn't even know that my that that I was that I could hear. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=893.0s)]
*  So there were times where I would be standing there with my mother and like people would just be making all type of all type of random comments and just disrespectful, you know, just hateful stuff. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=897.0s)]
*  And I would sit there as a kid, just kind of like looking up like like, dude, I can like hear you. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=907.0s)]
*  So, you know, I think my life took a significant turn. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=914.0s)]
*  And when I was in the fifth grade, I was always pretty smart. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=919.0s)]
*  But, you know, as as being smart and growing up in these neighborhoods, you know, the school systems are not really equipped to handle the number of children that's coming through. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=923.0s)]
*  So you have one teacher and like 30 kids and me just being who I was, I was always pretty smart. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=934.0s)]
*  And when I was finished with my work, I would kind of just clown around. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=940.0s)]
*  I had this teacher in the fifth grade, my math teacher. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=943.0s)]
*  And what he would do was he when you acted out in the classroom, he would call you to the front of the classroom. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=946.0s)]
*  He had a stack of rulers today. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=952.0s)]
*  He would be arrested back then. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=954.0s)]
*  But it was back then it was permissible. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=956.0s)]
*  It was considered as, you know, just punishing kids. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=958.0s)]
*  And he would call you to the front of the classroom. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=961.0s)]
*  He would make you stick out your hand and he would put salt. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=964.0s)]
*  He had a big salt shaker that he kept on his desk and he would sprinkle salt in your palm. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=967.0s)]
*  And he would smack the ruler into your hand and the salt would kind of embed itself into your palm and would kind of have like a little burning sensation. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=971.0s)]
*  So one day I decided that I was tired of it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=978.0s)]
*  And he called me to the front of the classroom and I put my hand out. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=984.0s)]
*  And when he swung, I moved my hand and he almost fell over. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=988.0s)]
*  He chased me around the classroom. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=991.0s)]
*  I ran out to the hallway. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=993.0s)]
*  He chased me into the hallway. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=994.0s)]
*  I grabbed the fire extinguisher off the wall and I sprayed him until he fell. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=996.0s)]
*  That was my reaction too. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1000.0s)]
*  I was like, he sounded like he deserved it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1002.0s)]
*  And he was cursing. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1004.0s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1005.0s)]
*  But long story short, I sat in the back of the police car for three hours as they determined my fate as a 10 year old. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1007.0s)]
*  Put me in handcuffs and everything. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1014.0s)]
*  And I had a counselor at that time. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1017.0s)]
*  And I guess she convinced them to send me to a hospital. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1019.0s)]
*  So they sent me to Mount Sinai Hospital psychiatric unit. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1024.0s)]
*  And I remember them sticking me with a needle. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1028.0s)]
*  10 year old kid, man. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1030.0s)]
*  Just, you know, just in a straight jacket being escorted to a hospital. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1032.0s)]
*  They stick me with a needle. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1037.0s)]
*  And so for months from Mount Sinai, I went to Metropolitan. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1039.0s)]
*  And I attempted to escape from Metropolitan and they sent me to a more secure area. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1043.0s)]
*  What's Metropolitan? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1049.0s)]
*  Metropolitan Hospital. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1050.0s)]
*  It's also a psych ward. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1052.0s)]
*  So why did they send you to a psych ward for that? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1053.0s)]
*  I guess they, you know, I was considered as a young black kid who's out of control with behavioral issues. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1057.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not sure exactly the gist of the conversation that took place. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1064.0s)]
*  But from what I've gathered now in the future is that my mother felt that she would rather see me in a hospital than to see me in a jail. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1068.0s)]
*  Because it was either that or they told her that they were going to send me to Sparford. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1078.0s)]
*  So I went through that just being subject to just a whole bunch of different medications. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1083.0s)]
*  Melarell, Haldor, lithium, Cojitin. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1090.0s)]
*  And then they transferred me to Pleasantville. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1093.0s)]
*  From Pleasantville I went to Hawthorne. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1096.0s)]
*  And, you know, and I'm going to be honest, this is where I learned how to become a criminal because prior to that I was just a kid. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1099.0s)]
*  They put me in this place where, you know, I was around older kids and these kids were really like about that life. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1104.0s)]
*  There was stuff, there was really bad stuff happening. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1112.0s)]
*  If you look up Hawthorne, see the nose to this day it's been closed for allegations of sex trafficking and child abuse. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1114.0s)]
*  Just so, because we know it because we're from New York, but those are juvenile detention facilities. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1121.0s)]
*  They're like group homes. Yeah, they're like juvenile detention facilities. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1127.0s)]
*  So they considered me as a person, they put what they called a pin on you and it's a person of interest, a person in need of assistance. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1130.0s)]
*  And they put you in these places and they just kind of just leave you there. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1139.0s)]
*  So I finally got out of there. I went through a lot there. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1144.0s)]
*  I was molested by a counselor. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1147.0s)]
*  And I finally escaped from there. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1150.0s)]
*  And I just went back into the streets at 13 years old. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1154.0s)]
*  And I just was offended for myself. I was out in the streets. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1158.0s)]
*  So it was three years of that? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1161.0s)]
*  Three years of that. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1162.0s)]
*  For one instance. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1163.0s)]
*  For one instance. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1165.0s)]
*  Where a guy's trying to hit you with a fucking roar. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1166.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1168.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1169.0s)]
*  And you know I always look back and I see that as a trajectory in my life that just changed everything. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1171.0s)]
*  I went from, you know, it changed me as a person. I lost my innocence. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1178.0s)]
*  I felt like after I left that place I was a darker person because of the things that I saw and the things that I went through. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1182.0s)]
*  So I come back and we're talking about this is 1988. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1190.0s)]
*  Crack at Rahalem. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1195.0s)]
*  You know you got kids 13, 14 years old making a thousand dollars every two, three days. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1197.0s)]
*  Selling drugs. Looking out on the corners. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1203.0s)]
*  This was like real stuff. You see New Jack City. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1206.0s)]
*  New Jack City was for real back then. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1209.0s)]
*  The people who grew up after that do not understand pre-crack and post-crack. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1211.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Big difference. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1217.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1218.0s)]
*  Devastated my community. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1220.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1221.0s)]
*  And how the fuck did that happen? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1224.0s)]
*  Like how the fuck did that happen? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1227.0s)]
*  When you go through the whole story of it and you go through like, I mean come on man. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1229.0s)]
*  Like I had Freeway Ricky Ross on here twice. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1234.0s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1237.0s)]
*  I ain't got to say it. He said it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1238.0s)]
*  So last night we were talking about this. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1239.0s)]
*  We were talking about like what do we want to accomplish today? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1242.0s)]
*  And last night when we were talking he's like well you know the CIA brought crack into, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1248.0s)]
*  I said you might want to stay away from that but here we are. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1257.0s)]
*  The fuck out of staying away from that man. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1260.0s)]
*  My friend Michael Rupert, rest in peace, he was the guy who stood in front of the city council on television and exposed it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1262.0s)]
*  He was a former Los Angeles Narcotics Officer. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1270.0s)]
*  And he said I personally witnessed the CIA selling drugs in the inner cities of Los Angeles. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1273.0s)]
*  And that was the Freeway Ricky Ross situation where they were using that money to fund the Contras versus the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1281.0s)]
*  It's really not as crazy because last night Sheldon's telling me about it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1290.0s)]
*  And I spent a long night into the early morning hours reading some of what you told me to read. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1295.0s)]
*  It's really not in dispute that it happened. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1303.0s)]
*  Not in dispute at all. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1306.0s)]
*  And what was, well I'm going to let Sheldon tell you. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1308.0s)]
*  What blew me away about it was that not only was it known how addictive it was, it was also known how easy it was to reproduce the process. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1311.0s)]
*  And how much cheaper it became. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1322.0s)]
*  Yeah, not only that, the differences in sentencing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1324.0s)]
*  The differences in sentencing. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1328.0s)]
*  That's the wildest thing. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1329.0s)]
*  One to five is like a... [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1331.0s)]
*  One to five ratio. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1332.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1333.0s)]
*  And then you had the Nelson, the Rockefeller drug laws that came into effect that required mandatory minimums and etc. etc. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1334.0s)]
*  So when we talk about social conditions and we talk about situations that were created for the purpose of what? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1343.0s)]
*  You know, you separated families. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1352.0s)]
*  You had mothers who, and really grandmothers who had to take care of the children because the mothers were in the streets smoking crack. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1355.0s)]
*  And the fathers were either in the streets using drugs, selling drugs, or in prison with astronomical sentences. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1364.0s)]
*  And removed from the family structure in totality because of these conditions. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1371.0s)]
*  So now you have the child just kind of left to fend for itself. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1377.0s)]
*  And we're not even talking about the children who were born that were subject to mothers who, you know, the crack baby, right? [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1380.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1388.0s)]
*  And that's just, I mean the list just goes on and on when we talk about social conditions and we talk about the long term effects of these conditions. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1389.0s)]
*  These conditions and how it produces behavior like Ivan Pavlov, one of my favorite psychologists, he talks about stimulus and a response, right? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1399.0s)]
*  A classical condition. And so you introduce the stimulus and then you have a response which equals to the condition that we see. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1407.0s)]
*  And you're also talking about what we were talking about earlier. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1417.0s)]
*  You're still dealing with these communities that are still suffering from segregation, Jim Crow. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1425.0s)]
*  And they throw crack in it, like just gasoline on a fire. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1426.0s)]
*  It's crazy because we've had this conversation in the abstract. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1430.0s)]
*  We've had this conversation, you know, about this very subject. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1434.0s)]
*  And then the more I got to know Sheldon and his story, I said, well, here was someone that not only lived it. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1438.0s)]
*  And I want to make clear one thing that has always struck me about Sheldon is his vulnerability, but also his honesty. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1445.0s)]
*  He's like, I'll be the first to tell you out of the gate, I did it. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1456.0s)]
*  I could have made better choices. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1461.0s)]
*  He's not asking for a pass based on his conditions. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1464.0s)]
*  What he's always said to me was, I just want people to consider how it may have impacted me. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1468.0s)]
*  So and to me, you just can't ignore it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1475.0s)]
*  It doesn't say, well, poor Sheldon. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1478.0s)]
*  I think that because I guess, you know, I know him the human being. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1481.0s)]
*  So I like a trip out when people are like, anybody that murders or robs or does it, lock them up and throw away the key. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1488.0s)]
*  I always feel like, well, look, why don't you explain to me how you have gotten to know somebody that has been brought up in different conditions than you were? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1498.0s)]
*  How long have you sat and listened to them? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1513.0s)]
*  How long have you considered how that might have impacted them and compared it to the conditions you grew up in? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1516.0s)]
*  How many people like him have you gotten to know? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1522.0s)]
*  So, again, I'm trying to walk a fine line between sounding preachy and just saying, let's just consider the circumstances in which he was born. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1525.0s)]
*  We're both 48. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1536.0s)]
*  I don't want to get into, you know, my family struggled financially, but had different opportunities. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1539.0s)]
*  My mom was a school teacher. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1547.0s)]
*  My dad was a knock around Brooklyn guy that did what he could do to, you know, provide for his family and wasn't always great at it, but he was a wonderful man. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1549.0s)]
*  But I can't ignore that I had different opportunities than Sheldon did. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1558.0s)]
*  So when he gets out and then he arrives back on the street, you know, I don't think anyone's going to argue with the fact that you're impacted and molded from 10 to 13 and forward 13 to 18 by who are the people you're around? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1563.0s)]
*  What are the conditions you're born in? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1581.0s)]
*  And I never even went back to school after that. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1583.0s)]
*  So I'm talking about after the fifth grade, I went back to school maybe for a week when I was 17 to Washington Irvin High School. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1585.0s)]
*  I went to school for a week and I just dropped back out. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1593.0s)]
*  I just saw no purpose in going to school. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1596.0s)]
*  And I really didn't go back to school and really educate myself until I went to prison. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1599.0s)]
*  Today I'm pursuing a master's in human services. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1605.0s)]
*  Before we get to your master's, why don't you explain to you get back at 13? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1608.0s)]
*  So I get back into my community at 13 and I'm just kind of not only am I not only am I like trying trying to wean myself from all of the narcotics that have been pumped into me for these last three years, I'm talking about I gained so much weight. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1613.0s)]
*  I went from a slim kid to being fat because of the medications that they was getting. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1631.0s)]
*  So what are they giving you? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1635.0s)]
*  They were giving me Haldor, lithium, Thorazine, Melaryl, and another medication called cogin. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1637.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that I'm aware of. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1645.0s)]
*  And I'm talking about I was just like heavily sedated. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1648.0s)]
*  And that's what they do to all the kids. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1651.0s)]
*  And that's what they did to most of the kids. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1653.0s)]
*  They just want to keep them calm and quiet. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1654.0s)]
*  Keep them calm and quiet. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1656.0s)]
*  Keep them calm and quiet. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1658.0s)]
*  Are they giving you any counseling when you're in there? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1660.0s)]
*  Are they talking? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1664.0s)]
*  It's superficial. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1666.0s)]
*  It's not really it's not you know you got a bunch of kids who sit around in a group and you know they do a feelings check. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1668.0s)]
*  But the counselors really the counselors as far as I was concerned the counselors didn't really care because they were there. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1674.0s)]
*  There was so much going on. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1679.0s)]
*  The counselors were just there for a check. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1681.0s)]
*  There was so much going on that was that was above and beyond what the counselors could control. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1682.0s)]
*  It was just ridiculous. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1688.0s)]
*  You had the kids going down into White Plains breaking into cars stealing getting high going across the campus having sex with the girls. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1690.0s)]
*  It was just insane what was going on. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1698.0s)]
*  And I you know I learned how to become this person. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1701.0s)]
*  I learned how to survive there. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1706.0s)]
*  I learned you know what it meant to go and steal a Benz box. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1708.0s)]
*  Remember the Benz boxes where you can snatch them right out the car people used to hide them. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1712.0s)]
*  I learned how to you know break into a car with the older guys and how to take a Benz box and sell it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1716.0s)]
*  So I learned how to survive there. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1722.0s)]
*  I mean I've always known how to survive superficially. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1724.0s)]
*  But from from I just feel like at that point I was put into a place where instead of getting real therapy or real help I was just kind of put into a place. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1727.0s)]
*  And I was I was like I was malleable. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1738.0s)]
*  You know I was I was young. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1741.0s)]
*  I was impressionable. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1742.0s)]
*  And this is what I was seeing. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1743.0s)]
*  These became my role models. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1745.0s)]
*  These were the guys that that I respected that I looked up to. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1747.0s)]
*  They you know they were selling drugs. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1752.0s)]
*  They didn't have a care in the world. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1754.0s)]
*  They had all of the girls. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1756.0s)]
*  And you know ironically prison in my community was almost like a rite of passage. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1758.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1764.0s)]
*  And my community when you went to prison and you came back and you didn't you didn't tell on nobody and you were able to hold it down. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1765.0s)]
*  And where it got back to the streets that you you didn't get robbed or you know you didn't get pumped. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1773.0s)]
*  People looked at you differently treated you differently. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1778.0s)]
*  I remember when I was 15 years old I wanted to go to Rikers Island so bad that I lied to the officer. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1780.0s)]
*  I got arrested for smoking. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1787.0s)]
*  I got arrested for smoking weed. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1789.0s)]
*  Weed is legal now. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1790.0s)]
*  But back then like weed was a thing. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1791.0s)]
*  Like if they saw you smoking weed that gave them justification to get out stop you take you down to the precinct run you for warrants and all kind of other stuff. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1794.0s)]
*  You sat in the bullpens for three four days before you even got out. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1801.0s)]
*  And I remember lying to the officer. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1805.0s)]
*  He said how old are you. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1807.0s)]
*  I said I'm 16 because I wanted to go to Rikers Island so that I could come back and be around the older guys and tell them hey listen I went I still got my sneakers you know and the girls and everybody just treated you different. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1808.0s)]
*  And it's really sad. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1821.0s)]
*  But that was a reality that I was faced with. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1823.0s)]
*  So I come back. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1827.0s)]
*  I'm 13 and I'm going through this stuff. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1828.0s)]
*  My mother's still struggling. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1830.0s)]
*  She's on SSD which is Social Security for Disability. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1832.0s)]
*  My father's in prison. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1836.0s)]
*  And it's just I just started selling drugs. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1840.0s)]
*  Guy offered me an opportunity to be a lookout. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1845.0s)]
*  He said listen kid I just need you know I'm gonna give you seventy five dollars a day. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1847.0s)]
*  I just need you to stand on that corner. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1850.0s)]
*  And when you see the police car just yell oh shit oh shit. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1852.0s)]
*  That was like a little thing. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1855.0s)]
*  And I would just stand in eventually I just slowly moved up the ranks and I and I became this person that I feel like I was never meant to be. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1857.0s)]
*  But because of the conditions and because of where I was at and because I what I saw what I was exposed to made me into someone else. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1865.0s)]
*  It turned me into into into this person that I was never meant to be. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1874.0s)]
*  And I just you know just when you're in these these these when you're in this melting pot of just insanity you you you know you lose sense of what's what's permissible and what's not and what's impermissible right. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1879.0s)]
*  You know I'm committing crimes and it just doesn't even matter no more. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1893.0s)]
*  I was never the guy you know to hurt any old people my era. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1898.0s)]
*  You know when you see old people come through you help them with their bags and we have respect for our elders. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1901.0s)]
*  And that was something that was always taught to us. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1906.0s)]
*  Now these kids is just that's a whole nother story. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1909.0s)]
*  But yeah I'm just and I'm committed and I'm getting arrested for little stupid crimes driving without a license. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1913.0s)]
*  Standing on a corner little small petty drug cases. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1920.0s)]
*  And I'm just I'm just kind of just moving through my life with no purpose. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1928.0s)]
*  But I'm providing for my family. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1934.0s)]
*  My mother doesn't you know at the end of the month we don't have to worry about just eating grits and cheese no more you know we can eat chicken and velvet shells and cheese. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1937.0s)]
*  You know and for some people that's significant you know I can buy a couch now I can buy a real couch with that that that's comfortable. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1945.0s)]
*  I can buy a TV for my mother I can you know set up a cable the way she can watch HBO all of these little small things that I wasn't able to do that she couldn't really do for herself after she paid the rent. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1952.0s)]
*  And that was significant and it made me feel like I had a purpose it made me feel like a man when in all actuality you know many of the values and the morals that I adopted growing up. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1963.0s)]
*  Which is so warped and so misplaced like Scarface the movie right you know you have this oh I don't work I don't break my balls in my word for nobody right you know and I remember one time a friend of mine he came to pick me up. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1976.0s)]
*  He was on a run from the cops he had a warrant out for his arrest he had a car full of drugs and a car full of guns and because I gave him my word I felt like I couldn't back out of the situation nothing bad happened but it's just the idea of sometimes growing up and adopting these values and these morals. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=1987.0s)]
*  And you begin you begin to take them on as part of your characteristics and you just you just make you end up making really really bad decisions that can cost you for the rest of your life like my son like when my son when he when he got into a he got into a fight with the Asian guy they called him the Columbia law student killer right. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2006.0s)]
*  And he gets into a fight with this Chinese guy and this is not to take away anything from that man's family and you know as a man as his father I felt some type of way. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2026.0s)]
*  But the guy goes into the street and gets hit by a car and he dies. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2036.0s)]
*  But this is how fast your life can change from just one simple mistake. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2040.0s)]
*  And I just feel like you know a lot of times these conditions are created and there's really no there's no alternatives. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2046.0s)]
*  I had never been on a plane like I said like I never even thought about going on a plane. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2056.0s)]
*  So I'm growing up in this community. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2062.0s)]
*  My father's gone. My mother's you know she's deaf I ended up having a son. My son was born in 1993. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2066.0s)]
*  And that just made things that just exacerbated the issue right so now I'm really you know what am I going to do now you know I have a son I have someone to look at and despite how many times I said that I was never going to be who my father was. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2075.0s)]
*  My actions were actually setting me up to be exactly who my father was and removed me from my son's life. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2091.0s)]
*  And in 19 I caught the gun charge that that that that triggered the felony that allowed them to be able to sentence me the way that they did in 1994. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2100.0s)]
*  I also caught another case at that time I was I was I was what you call giving out consignment on drugs to people in particular. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2113.0s)]
*  I gave consignment to and I ended up getting arrested for a case. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2122.0s)]
*  And when I sent someone to go pick up the money from them. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2128.0s)]
*  It kind of just was like you know whatever I'm not paying them. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2132.0s)]
*  So when I came home on one guy in particular I ran into him with his girlfriend. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2136.0s)]
*  He'll be that case got dismissed right. The gun charge. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2142.0s)]
*  No the one that you were away for. You got arrested for something. You're in jail. Yes. These guys figure since you're in jail. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2146.0s)]
*  Fuck it we're not going to pay him. Yeah I'm not going to pay. And then the case that you were arrested for got dismissed. Got dismissed. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2154.0s)]
*  I got to leave. So then you come home. So I come home and you know I need my money. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2160.0s)]
*  I need my money. I'm just just just just me being honest is just miss being straight. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2167.0s)]
*  No I gave you something and we had an understanding that you were going to pay me. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2171.0s)]
*  And when I came home when I finally located this particular individual he had his girlfriend with him. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2177.0s)]
*  And this guy owed me five thousand dollars for some drugs that I gave him on consignment. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2184.0s)]
*  I gave him an eighth of a kilo which is one hundred and twenty five grams of cocaine. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2189.0s)]
*  And when I saw him he had a bunch of jewelry on. He was with his girlfriend. She had a bunch of jewelry on. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2197.0s)]
*  I said hey man where's my money at. Oh yeah I was going to pay you. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2201.0s)]
*  As far as I was concerned his jewelry was we was even. So I robbed him and I took his jewelry and his girlfriend happened to be there. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2208.0s)]
*  And unfortunately she got caught up in the situation. I had a bunch of young guys with me and they robbed her as well. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2219.0s)]
*  And he got hit in the head with the gun right here on the side of his head and he had two stitches. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2228.0s)]
*  And they gave me twenty five years for that case. Did you hit him in the head. No one of the guys that I was with hit him in the head. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2235.0s)]
*  And he identified me in a photo array unbeknownst to me. He identified me in a photo array. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2245.0s)]
*  This guy you know as far as I was concerned he was in the streets just like I was. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2252.0s)]
*  So right I didn't really understand that you know like I said we go back to morals and values and principles and how warped they can be right. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2256.0s)]
*  In my mind at the time this is a guy who I gave something to. He's living an illegal life. I'm living an illegal life. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2264.0s)]
*  So as far as I was concerned at that time it was fair game. In hindsight as I as I moved on and I became more mature and I began to reevaluate myself I realized how wrong that was. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2271.0s)]
*  But that was later on. At this time I committed the crime and I just kept moving. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2283.0s)]
*  Another guy that I ran into he also owed me some money. He owed me seven thousand dollars and it kind of went along the same ways. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2290.0s)]
*  He was selling drugs out of an auto parts store. He was a Spanish guy. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2297.0s)]
*  I got word that this is where he was at and he was selling drugs and I was going to get my money. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2303.0s)]
*  And the same circumstances kind of ensued. Saw him. Hey what's going on. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2308.0s)]
*  You know reading in between the lines and outside the margins without really going into all of the details I robbed him because he owed me seven thousand dollars. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2313.0s)]
*  Did he get physically hurt. No he didn't get touched. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2323.0s)]
*  Got roughed up a little bit but there was no physical there was no physical harm. Nothing. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2328.0s)]
*  Going back to morals and values and principles right in my mind he was fair game. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2336.0s)]
*  He's selling drugs I'm selling drugs you owe me money. I came to take what you have. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2342.0s)]
*  In that world that was considered as permissible. These are one of the rules of something that was permissible. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2347.0s)]
*  In that world. Long story short in December 1997 I get arrested for both cases really for one of them for the one with the guy and the girl. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2354.0s)]
*  And then the other case drops with the auto parts store. I said they were selling drugs out of the auto parts store. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2366.0s)]
*  I am in the process of going to court I'm going back and forth to court I'm on Rikers Island at the time. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2374.0s)]
*  It's just crazy on Rikers Island. That's when the gangs was involved. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2380.0s)]
*  Prior to that a year before that I had got involved with the gangs. I was I was blood. I was a gang member. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2386.0s)]
*  This is where the cut come from on my face. I have a bunch of stab marks from just being in those environments and being on Rikers Island and just being in those environments. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2393.0s)]
*  Rikers Island and just. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2403.0s)]
*  Warring with other rival gangs mostly Latin Kings and yet does. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2406.0s)]
*  My final offer before trial was 23 years. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2415.0s)]
*  Which kind of blew me away because my lawyer kept telling me that my maximum sentence was 25 years if I went to trial. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2420.0s)]
*  So in my mind I it just didn't make no sense to me why would I forfeit my rights to an appeal if there's only a two year difference. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2426.0s)]
*  I told the judge I would take 15 years right now. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2435.0s)]
*  I acknowledge that I had that I had made some mistakes and I had done some things that that were wrong and I said I'll take 15 years right now. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2439.0s)]
*  He refused to accept my plea offer and I went to trial and I ended up getting 50 years. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2448.0s)]
*  Five zero and so they give you 25 for each case is 25 for each case. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2456.0s)]
*  Consecutive. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2463.0s)]
*  So and I remember. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2467.0s)]
*  I remember like blowing trial and just not really understanding like what was being there but not like it was like almost surreal and I remember when I went and got sentenced and the judge said 50 years now. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2471.0s)]
*  Mind you I had a black lawyer a black judge and a white prosecutor. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2484.0s)]
*  And I remember when he said 50 years he said he went into all of these. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2491.0s)]
*  Reasons why he was sentencing me the way that he was sentencing me. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2499.0s)]
*  There was never no post. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2504.0s)]
*  There was never no. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2505.0s)]
*  They're supposed to do a report prior to your sentencing and it's called a post supervision interview. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2508.0s)]
*  Pre sentencing into an investigation is called the PSI pre sentencing investigation there was never no pre sentencing investigation. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2516.0s)]
*  There was never no mitigating evidence presented on my behalf to highlight why I may have made some of the decisions that I made. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2523.0s)]
*  And he just called me a menace to society and he just gave me 50 years. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2531.0s)]
*  And I remember when I when I first got the downstate which is a processing facility and they give you what they call is a time computation sheet. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2537.0s)]
*  And on the time computation sheet it gives you all of the numbers like the beginning of your bid how much jail time you have. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2546.0s)]
*  And I just remember 2049 that's all I kept looking at. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2553.0s)]
*  And I was like 2049. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2559.0s)]
*  Are they fucking serious. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2564.0s)]
*  Since 1998 1999. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2566.0s)]
*  And I'm trying to do the math and I'm just like 2049. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2570.0s)]
*  I'm like that's 50 years from now. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2574.0s)]
*  And I remember going to the law library and I forget how I get the world arm in that. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2578.0s)]
*  And something just says look up life expectancy. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2585.0s)]
*  And I look up my life expectancy and as an African American man my life expectancy at that time was 67 years old and I did the math. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2588.0s)]
*  And I said I'm going to die in prison. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2596.0s)]
*  I just really believe that I was going to die in prison. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2602.0s)]
*  One thing I learned really really quickly when I got to prison was that prison does two things to you. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2608.0s)]
*  It brings out the best or brings out the worst. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2613.0s)]
*  And what I saw was I saw individuals who were at their worst and I saw guys who were at their best. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2616.0s)]
*  The guys who were at their best were guys who were involved in education post-secondary education programs. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2624.0s)]
*  They were running the program. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2630.0s)]
*  They were running the violence groups. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2632.0s)]
*  They were running the substance abuse groups. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2633.0s)]
*  And I remember saying to myself I want that. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2637.0s)]
*  And I remember just being involved in so much bullshit because I was in a gang. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2640.0s)]
*  And I was I was I was top of the food chain. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2646.0s)]
*  I had my own nation. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2650.0s)]
*  I wasn't just like the random gang member. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2651.0s)]
*  I had a whole nation under me. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2656.0s)]
*  And I was just in and out the box in and out the box solitary confinement which has been considered as unconstitutional now. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2660.0s)]
*  And I remember just having these moments of reflection and just asking myself like what are you going to do. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2669.0s)]
*  Can you spend the next 48 years living like this. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2676.0s)]
*  I said I couldn't do it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2683.0s)]
*  And I had lost all my privileges. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2685.0s)]
*  They took everything from me. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2689.0s)]
*  I was in Southport at the time which is closed now. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2690.0s)]
*  It's a solitary confinement facility in New York state. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2694.0s)]
*  And I was on a loaf which is also unconstitutional now. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2698.0s)]
*  So the loaf is a dietary restriction that they give you. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2701.0s)]
*  It's a chunk of bread and it has cabbage and carrots in it. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2705.0s)]
*  And they give you like a quarter of a cabbage and they give you a cup of milk when they can't take any more of your privileges. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2709.0s)]
*  This is what they would give you six days out the week on the seventh day you would get a hot meal breakfast lunch and dinner. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2714.0s)]
*  And then it would go back for 21 days. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2720.0s)]
*  They would do the six and one six and one six and one. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2722.0s)]
*  And it was at that moment where I really said I have to change my life. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2726.0s)]
*  I have to change my life. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2732.0s)]
*  I just can't do this. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2734.0s)]
*  I had a wife. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2737.0s)]
*  I had family still. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2738.0s)]
*  My son was growing up. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2739.0s)]
*  He was hearing stories about my so-called notoriety. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2742.0s)]
*  And I just didn't want to I just didn't want to be that dad. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2748.0s)]
*  Like I really was looking at myself and really evaluating asking myself like what the fuck are you doing. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2754.0s)]
*  I was still so I was smoking a lot of weed at the time. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2761.0s)]
*  I was drinking on jailhouse hooch and I was at my worst. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2764.0s)]
*  And I had to I had to figure out how to get to my best. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2771.0s)]
*  So I decided to when I got out of solitary confinement I did 42 days on the loaf. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2775.0s)]
*  I went from being 210 pounds to 168 in like a matter of seven months. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2783.0s)]
*  And I got out of there like that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2790.0s)]
*  And I didn't want to do it again. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2791.0s)]
*  I got out of there like I'm going to do something bad. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2793.0s)]
*  And that's when I got out of there like I just couldn't. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2795.0s)]
*  It was just really like deflated me. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2797.0s)]
*  And when I got out I made a decision that I was going to walk away and I didn't care about what the consequences was. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2801.0s)]
*  And I said to myself I've been doing bad for so long I'm going to try to do something good. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2806.0s)]
*  getting to school program, I got my GED. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2813.0s)]
*  I left the gangs alone, which was a benefit for them [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2816.72s)]
*  because I was what you call an authoritarian. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2819.52s)]
*  I was a rule guy. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2823.36s)]
*  I'm still a rule guy. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2824.52s)]
*  I like rules. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2825.76s)]
*  I like rules, I like structure, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2826.9s)]
*  I like things to be a certain way. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2828.12s)]
*  And it was to their advantage to get rid of me anyway. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2830.42s)]
*  Plus I knew a lot of the guys who were at the top. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2833.48s)]
*  Why was it to their advantage to get rid of you? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2835.92s)]
*  Because I was the type of person who would say, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2838.0s)]
*  you're doing that for what reason? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2843.64s)]
*  Nah, you can't do that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2845.44s)]
*  The rule says that you can't do this, you can't do this. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2847.04s)]
*  This is what the rules say. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2849.68s)]
*  And I was- [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2851.76s)]
*  The rules of the prison or the rules of the streets? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2852.6s)]
*  The rules of the gang. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2853.92s)]
*  The rules of the street. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2854.76s)]
*  Yeah, there was rules. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2856.32s)]
*  Give us a for instance. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2858.66s)]
*  Okay, so for instance, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2860.64s)]
*  I could be in a whole nother facility. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2864.36s)]
*  Let's say I'm in Greenhaven and a guy's in Attica [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2865.76s)]
*  and they want to do something to him [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2869.88s)]
*  because they feel like he's not sharing his proceeds [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2873.3199999999997s)]
*  of drugs that he's bringing into the facility. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2879.12s)]
*  The rules say you can't do that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2881.68s)]
*  That's his property, that's his belongings. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2885.56s)]
*  So I was a rule guy and they just, you know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2887.9199999999996s)]
*  it was to their advantage to get me out of the way. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2889.8799999999997s)]
*  So when I decided to take a step back, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2891.8399999999997s)]
*  they were like, yes. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2894.04s)]
*  And it was to my advantage as well. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2896.96s)]
*  And this was in 2005. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2900.48s)]
*  So there was no resistance? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2902.88s)]
*  None. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2904.0800000000004s)]
*  And at that time, this is where a lot of the, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2906.0800000000004s)]
*  what they call set tripping began. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2908.6400000000003s)]
*  The organization began to implode on itself. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2911.48s)]
*  The gang organization? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2915.88s)]
*  The gang organization. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2916.7200000000003s)]
*  There was a lot of infighting, sets against sets. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2917.5600000000004s)]
*  And I was just always against that. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  And it was time for me to go. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2924.92s)]
*  And I didn't care whatever the consequences was. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2926.0800000000004s)]
*  I was fortunate that there weren't any consequences. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2928.6400000000003s)]
*  But I didn't care what the consequences was. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2933.1600000000003s)]
*  I just walked away. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2935.1600000000003s)]
*  And then that begins your journey. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2936.8s)]
*  This begins my journey. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2939.2400000000002s)]
*  I got into school, I got my GED. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2940.4s)]
*  From there, I got involved in correspondence courses. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2943.6800000000003s)]
*  I started interacting with guys who were teaching [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2947.1600000000003s)]
*  ART, aggression replacement training. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2949.8s)]
*  And I started to begin to understand [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2951.84s)]
*  how these concepts work, what positive visualization is. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2954.0400000000004s)]
*  Deep breathing, how to remove yourself, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2958.48s)]
*  conflict resolution, all of these ideas of change [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2960.6s)]
*  began to take place with me. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2965.72s)]
*  Substance abuse, I stopped smoking weed, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2969.12s)]
*  I stopped smoking cigarettes. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2971.0s)]
*  I was smoking like 30 cigarettes a day. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2972.08s)]
*  I mean, I'm literally having chest pains [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2974.54s)]
*  from smoking cigarettes. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2977.7599999999998s)]
*  And I realized that I wanted to live. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2979.12s)]
*  And the only way that I was gonna be able to live [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2983.12s)]
*  and walk out of prison was to remove myself [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  from these substances. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2987.72s)]
*  I seen so many guys get carried out. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2990.0s)]
*  I seen guys dying. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2993.32s)]
*  Not just from just being stabbed [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2996.2000000000003s)]
*  or with altercations from officers. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=2999.0s)]
*  I seen guys dying from, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3001.54s)]
*  one guy I knew he used to drink so much hooch, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3003.6s)]
*  his liver failed on him one night. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3006.76s)]
*  He died in the cell that night. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3008.36s)]
*  The morning when they came to do that count, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3009.6800000000003s)]
*  he was frozen, he was stiff as a log. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3011.16s)]
*  But these are the things that I was seeing. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3014.12s)]
*  And I was really in a situation [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3015.6800000000003s)]
*  where I had to ask myself, do I wanna go out like that? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3018.84s)]
*  And I didn't wanna go out like that. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3024.56s)]
*  Tell me about Jailhouse Hooch. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3026.92s)]
*  How are they making that? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3028.48s)]
*  So there's a bunch of ways they can make it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3030.52s)]
*  You can use fruit juice, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3033.76s)]
*  but a lot of guys use tomato paste. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3035.7200000000003s)]
*  Tomato paste, water, and sugar. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3038.6800000000003s)]
*  You need a kicker, which is like what they call, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3040.1600000000003s)]
*  like a mash. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3044.78s)]
*  You would call it a mash, they call it a kicker. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3046.6s)]
*  Get a plastic bag, you put it in a plastic bag. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3049.08s)]
*  You let it blow up, it goes through the process, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3052.3199999999997s)]
*  the carbon dioxide process. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3054.36s)]
*  I did a whole paper on ethanol when I was in Cornell, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3056.04s)]
*  so that I could learn how the process was. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3061.72s)]
*  And it's pretty good stuff, especially if you distill it. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3065.72s)]
*  But it's bad for you because it has a component in it [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  called methane, and it goes straight to your brain. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3073.04s)]
*  In the streets when distillation [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3077.56s)]
*  places or facilities, they distill it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3081.2s)]
*  They remove that part of the alcohol, the methane. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3083.36s)]
*  But in prison, guys just drink it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3087.3199999999997s)]
*  It's just like, I don't give a fuck. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  Or you make the fruit juice. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3092.72s)]
*  Same thing, plastic bag, sugar, kicker, mash. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3095.0s)]
*  What is the kicker? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3099.2s)]
*  The kicker is to accelerate the process. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3100.48s)]
*  I know, but what does it consist of? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3102.44s)]
*  Usually spoiled fruit, some spoiled bread with mold on it [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3103.76s)]
*  because it begins the process of fermentation. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3109.32s)]
*  It's like a mash. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3113.32s)]
*  So this shit's gotta be super toxic for you. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3115.36s)]
*  Oh, super fucking toxic. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3117.28s)]
*  Dude's is dropping like flies, man. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3119.6000000000004s)]
*  Like flies. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3123.1600000000003s)]
*  When you hear going forward how Sheldon changed his life, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3126.84s)]
*  not just the correspondence courses, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3131.84s)]
*  but all of these various counseling programs, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3141.6400000000003s)]
*  outreach programs, his connections to the outside world [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3145.48s)]
*  which he'll talk about, is that the impossibly sick, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3149.92s)]
*  fucking twisted, horrifically sad irony to all of this [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3155.36s)]
*  is that it took prison to save him. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3168.08s)]
*  And why couldn't he be saved as a kid? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3173.96s)]
*  As a kid, that's what I am really trying [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3179.2400000000002s)]
*  to sort of put energy towards now. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3185.04s)]
*  When you asked him earlier, wasn't there counseling [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3188.64s)]
*  in the group home? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3193.28s)]
*  And if you see what this counseling is like, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3195.92s)]
*  obviously I can't cast aspersions on every counselor [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3201.64s)]
*  in a group home across America, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3204.76s)]
*  but I've had people on the podcast with me [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3206.24s)]
*  and I'm listening to their anger management classes. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3211.9599999999996s)]
*  I won't mention who it is, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3216.72s)]
*  but I'm listening to the anger management class [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3217.9199999999996s)]
*  that they take. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3220.0s)]
*  And it's fucking, it's on Zoom. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  It's run by a guy that can't fucking turn his camera on. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3226.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's like, it is, it's bedlam. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3231.36s)]
*  There's just people screaming, hey man, I can't hear you. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3237.48s)]
*  What the fuck did you just say? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3241.2400000000002s)]
*  You hear not just the anger and the frustration, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3243.1200000000003s)]
*  but the guy's inability to control the situation, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3245.6000000000004s)]
*  to control the technology, let alone giving out, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3249.52s)]
*  real advice. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3256.8s)]
*  Real advice and constructive feedback [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3257.6400000000003s)]
*  on how different people are. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3259.88s)]
*  He's checking a box, this guy, to do a job. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3262.0s)]
*  Is that happening with everyone? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3264.12s)]
*  It's not happening with everyone, but again, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3266.2s)]
*  just the paradox here is that this insane, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3270.2799999999997s)]
*  inhumane sentence actually saved Shelton. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3276.0s)]
*  But why aren't there those programs, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3283.3599999999997s)]
*  that thought that implementation in his community [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  to save him as a kid? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3291.8799999999997s)]
*  And I don't just take cases. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3294.96s)]
*  The Perlmutter Center, where I'm the executive director, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3300.12s)]
*  the Perlmutter Senator for Legal Justice [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3303.2s)]
*  at Cardozo Law School, we get a massive amount of mail. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3305.56s)]
*  And we get a lot of people calling us [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3311.6s)]
*  to help out on cases. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3313.04s)]
*  I want to help as many people as we can, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3314.68s)]
*  but people that I think can succeed, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3317.12s)]
*  or that we can help succeed when they get out. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3319.68s)]
*  And on paper, you can see pretty quickly [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3322.56s)]
*  what somebody has done with their time. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3328.5s)]
*  I've sat with people in institutions all over the country [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3332.7999999999997s)]
*  where I say, what programs are you in? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3337.72s)]
*  And I feel like an idiot asking, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3340.0s)]
*  because I'd be a fucking puddle on the floor. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3342.04s)]
*  I asked him many times, how often did you cry? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3345.8s)]
*  How did you extract yourself from the gang? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3352.28s)]
*  How did you sleep at night with the noise? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3355.96s)]
*  Shelton told me about this thing called a human harpoon [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3360.48s)]
*  that people make out of magazines and a sharpened toothbrush. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3364.64s)]
*  Can you fucking, the mind fuck on this, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3369.04s)]
*  they stiffen the pages of a magazine with toothpaste, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3374.16s)]
*  soap, water, let it dry, let it dry, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3381.2799999999997s)]
*  so that they could basically work it into a rod. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3383.72s)]
*  You keep on working the paper between your hands, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3386.8s)]
*  and then you attach with soap, newspaper, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3390.48s)]
*  a sharpened toothbrush handle at the end of it. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3395.8s)]
*  Or what? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3401.0s)]
*  A bone. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3401.84s)]
*  Or a bone from something that they ate in the mess hall. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3402.6800000000003s)]
*  From something that you ate in the mess hall. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3406.6800000000003s)]
*  And then you're walking past their cell, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3408.0s)]
*  and you're, all of a sudden you get fucking stabbed [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3410.6800000000003s)]
*  with a harpoon, so I'm thinking, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3415.6000000000004s)]
*  or have feces thrown on you. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3418.88s)]
*  So I'm trying to process all of that. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3420.92s)]
*  And to be able to navigate that hell, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3424.8s)]
*  and come out halfway sane. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3428.04s)]
*  And I'm just, I'm so, it hurts me deep in my fucking guts [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3431.04s)]
*  to hear that I'm hearing you talk, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3441.96s)]
*  and then I'm thinking this is what it took to save you. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3444.3599999999997s)]
*  When I think about, he was 10 years old, my son's 11, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3449.8399999999997s)]
*  and that, it's hard to listen to. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3455.84s)]
*  And yeah, it's hard to process that you were able [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3460.84s)]
*  to have that wherewithal to sit a day [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3464.6400000000003s)]
*  in solitary confinement, let alone 42 days. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3466.88s)]
*  And so your process, when you decide [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3472.04s)]
*  that you're gonna try to do good, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3476.56s)]
*  like how difficult was the process of trying to- [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3479.48s)]
*  It was lonely. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3483.84s)]
*  Establish an education. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3484.6800000000003s)]
*  It was lonely. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3486.56s)]
*  I had, on one side I had the guys who I used to run with [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3488.1200000000003s)]
*  saying, what the fuck is he doing? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3492.28s)]
*  And then I had the guys who were actually doing good [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3495.52s)]
*  just watching me to see if I was going to crumble or fail. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3498.8s)]
*  You had a handful of guys that committed me [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3505.28s)]
*  and said, yo, I applaud you, I got you, man. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3508.04s)]
*  If you need some help, I can help you do this, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3510.2400000000002s)]
*  I can help you do that, but I felt like everybody [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3512.8s)]
*  in the world was watching, including my family, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3517.0s)]
*  because they didn't believe it. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3520.0s)]
*  Up until the point to where I graduated from Cornell, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3521.0800000000004s)]
*  my cousin told me, she said, when you called me [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3524.52s)]
*  and invited me to the graduation, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3528.2400000000002s)]
*  she said, I didn't believe it. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3530.8s)]
*  I didn't believe nothing you had told me [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3532.48s)]
*  prior for the last 10 years, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3535.1200000000003s)]
*  anything that you said you did [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3536.4s)]
*  until I saw you at that graduation. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3538.04s)]
*  So I had family, everybody just kind of [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3540.8s)]
*  just waiting for me to fail. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3543.36s)]
*  But I just felt like I was just determined to succeed. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3548.6000000000004s)]
*  I just had this energy in my spirit. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3551.32s)]
*  And it was the will to live. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3557.92s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, it was the will to live. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3561.1200000000003s)]
*  I had read, when I was in solitary confinement, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3562.8s)]
*  I read Victor Frankl's, Man's Search for Meaning. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3565.4s)]
*  And one of the things that struck me as being so powerful, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3568.72s)]
*  he says, if you have a why, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3572.3999999999996s)]
*  then you have a reason to live. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3575.44s)]
*  And this is a guy who was in a concentration camp [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3577.3199999999997s)]
*  during the Holocaust, and he found a reason to live. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3580.3999999999996s)]
*  He found a reason, and I'm sitting in the cell [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3585.3199999999997s)]
*  and I'm asking myself, do you have a fucking reason to live? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3588.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think about my family, and that was my reason. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3593.4s)]
*  And I wanted to beat the system. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3603.2400000000002s)]
*  And that was my way of beating the system. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3607.84s)]
*  I'm not gonna let you motherfuckers kill me. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3610.76s)]
*  And that was my spirit. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3616.36s)]
*  And I know it was only one way for me to accomplish that. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3618.1600000000003s)]
*  So like I said, I started going to school, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3621.2400000000002s)]
*  I did the correspondence courses, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3623.1600000000003s)]
*  I got involved in the Cornell Prison Education Program, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3624.4s)]
*  I obtained my associate's degree, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3628.84s)]
*  and then I went on to obtain my bachelor's [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3632.08s)]
*  in behavioral science for Mercy. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3635.88s)]
*  But in this process, I'm going through, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3638.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm mentoring other young men. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3643.4s)]
*  Now guys are looking at me and saying, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3645.08s)]
*  hold on, wait a minute, man, this guy is onto something. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3647.6400000000003s)]
*  I got guys on both sides now saying, yo, can you help me? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3651.08s)]
*  I started working in the law library. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3656.64s)]
*  I discovered that I had a knack for complicated things, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3658.36s)]
*  case law, and I was helping guys, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3661.44s)]
*  and I was actually helping guys get out of prison. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3663.88s)]
*  And I started running the programs. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3669.08s)]
*  And I think that's something. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3672.56s)]
*  What programs did you run? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3673.88s)]
*  So I ran aggression replacement training. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3675.3199999999997s)]
*  And how many years in do you start doing this? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3677.84s)]
*  About nine years in, eight years in. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3682.08s)]
*  I got arrested in 1997 and about 2005, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3687.08s)]
*  this is when I started to make my transitions, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3693.08s)]
*  about eight years in. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3695.08s)]
*  And it felt good. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3700.08s)]
*  It felt good. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3702.08s)]
*  It felt good to be able to call my family [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3704.08s)]
*  and send them pictures and invite them to these events [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3706.68s)]
*  where they can actually see me change. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3710.08s)]
*  They can see actual, tangible change. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3712.08s)]
*  It felt good for the guys that I knew [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3718.08s)]
*  that were coming to me and asking me for help. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3721.08s)]
*  I was helping guys with their GEDs. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3723.08s)]
*  I became a tutor in the program. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3725.08s)]
*  And the rewards that I felt, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3730.08s)]
*  it didn't even matter anymore about [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3734.08s)]
*  when I was gonna get out, right? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3736.08s)]
*  It was just now about how can I help other people [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3739.08s)]
*  not go through what I went through and wait so long? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3743.08s)]
*  Because I feel like I wish I had somebody [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3747.08s)]
*  that would have came along at an earlier stage. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3750.08s)]
*  And like he said, don't wait till I fall. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3753.08s)]
*  Catch me before I fall. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3756.08s)]
*  And that's part of my motto now [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3758.08s)]
*  and some of the work that we do [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3760.08s)]
*  at the Queens Defenders, the alternatives to incarceration. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3762.08s)]
*  And this is why I'm so passionate about [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3765.08s)]
*  a lot of the work that I do now. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3767.08s)]
*  I'm trying to catch these kids before they fall. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3769.08s)]
*  I don't wanna wait till they're falling. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3774.08s)]
*  And I wanna show them the way. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3779.08s)]
*  And I feel like I'm a credible messenger [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3780.08s)]
*  because when they see me, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3784.08s)]
*  they know that I came from the same place they come from. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3786.08s)]
*  Like Josh was saying earlier, right? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3789.08s)]
*  There's a difference between being qualified and certified, right? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3790.08s)]
*  You could read a hundred books about drug abuse, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3794.08s)]
*  but how qualified are you to really tell somebody [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3798.08s)]
*  who's sick on heroin [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3802.08s)]
*  and they're ready to do anything that they can [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3804.08s)]
*  for a bag of dope of what you went through? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3806.08s)]
*  You can't. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3808.08s)]
*  And this experience is priceless. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3809.08s)]
*  You said it way better than I did. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3815.08s)]
*  Certified versus qualified. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3817.08s)]
*  And that's why I'm just sitting back watching [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3821.08s)]
*  the work that Sheldon is doing now. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3825.08s)]
*  What's your official title at the Queens Defenders? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3829.08s)]
*  Client Advocate. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3832.08s)]
*  We just created the Yelp. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3835.08s)]
*  We titled it Yelp, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3837.08s)]
*  me and two other brothers that I was incarcerated with formerly, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3839.08s)]
*  Bruce Bryant and Rashad Rouhani. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3842.08s)]
*  We're Client Advocates. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3846.08s)]
*  We run the Youth Emergent Leadership Program, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3847.08s)]
*  and we work directly with the district attorneys [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3849.08s)]
*  and the judges at the courts [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3852.08s)]
*  dealing with the alternative to incarceration program. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3855.08s)]
*  A lot of the young kids that catch the gun charges, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3858.08s)]
*  we bring them into our program. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3860.08s)]
*  We help them with job readiness training, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3863.08s)]
*  whether it's OSHA training. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3866.08s)]
*  We help them get their GEDs. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3868.08s)]
*  We direct them to different programs. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3870.08s)]
*  Like we got a program called Hood Coding, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3872.08s)]
*  and this is also a guy who was previously incarcerated, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3875.08s)]
*  and he teaches coding to younger kids [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3878.08s)]
*  inside the inner cities in the projects. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3882.08s)]
*  Like coding as in computer coding? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3884.08s)]
*  Like computer coding. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3886.08s)]
*  He teaches coding, and we get them into our program. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3887.08s)]
*  We help them with their resumes, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3891.08s)]
*  because one of the main things we realize is that [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3892.08s)]
*  outside of everything else, a lot of these kids, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3895.08s)]
*  they're impoverished. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3897.08s)]
*  They don't have nothing. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3899.08s)]
*  So we want to be able to try to help them [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3901.08s)]
*  with some type of employment, right? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3903.08s)]
*  That's number one, and then we take them through our program. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3905.08s)]
*  We have a 36-week, 10-point program. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3908.08s)]
*  It deals with conflict resolution. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3910.08s)]
*  It deals with knowing your rights, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3913.08s)]
*  how to have a conversation with an officer. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3915.08s)]
*  One of the things that I take pride in [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3917.08s)]
*  while I was incarcerated, I was also in the theater program. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3920.08s)]
*  I played Macbeth on the stage. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3924.08s)]
*  I also was on the debate team. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3929.08s)]
*  We debated against Stanford, Harvard, and Yale [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3931.08s)]
*  on the topic of the future of automation, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3933.08s)]
*  and we crushed them. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3935.08s)]
*  But one of the things I learned in those arenas [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3936.08s)]
*  is critical thinking and critical analysis, right? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3940.08s)]
*  How do you critically think about a situation? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3944.08s)]
*  And also looking back, I realized something about myself [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3946.08s)]
*  is that I did not have a term that I coined [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3950.08s)]
*  called situational cognizance, right? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3954.08s)]
*  As a kid, for some reason, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3958.08s)]
*  I felt like I was not able to see [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3961.08s)]
*  the long-term consequences of my behavior. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3963.08s)]
*  It was like a wall there. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3967.08s)]
*  And I think a lot of these younger kids [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3970.08s)]
*  are also suffering from the same thing. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3973.08s)]
*  And the system sets you up. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3975.08s)]
*  The system tricks you because you catch these cases, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3977.08s)]
*  and what they do is they slap you on the wrist, right? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3981.08s)]
*  You catch this gun charge, and they say, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3984.08s)]
*  you never know, we're just going to give you six months. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3986.08s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3988.08s)]
*  What they don't tell you is that gun charge is a pretext now [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3989.08s)]
*  to enhance your sentence when you catch another case. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3994.08s)]
*  So it's almost like a form of entrapment, right? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=3998.08s)]
*  And a lot of these kids don't understand that. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4001.08s)]
*  They think that these cases that they're catching [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4003.08s)]
*  are just going to disappear. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4005.08s)]
*  They don't realize that there's a paper trail being established [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4007.08s)]
*  that's being created. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4010.08s)]
*  There's a profile being created against you. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4011.08s)]
*  And when you reach a certain threshold, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4013.08s)]
*  there's a term that I like to say, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4016.08s)]
*  they're going to knock your fucking head off. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4018.08s)]
*  And you're going to find yourself, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4021.08s)]
*  a lot of these kids find themselves in situations [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4022.08s)]
*  where they get 25 years for an assault. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4024.08s)]
*  You remember Scared Straight? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4027.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4031.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4032.08s)]
*  I think the effectiveness of Scared Straight [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4035.08s)]
*  was because of the messenger. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4037.08s)]
*  So you're seeing the change right now. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4039.08s)]
*  And this is not meant to blow sunshine up your ass [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4044.08s)]
*  because you get plenty of that and you deserve it. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4049.08s)]
*  But I was in a situation last time I was here [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4052.08s)]
*  where I felt a little bit hopeless. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4056.08s)]
*  And now I'm trending toward more hopeful [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4058.08s)]
*  because Bruce Bryan, who was on the show, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4062.08s)]
*  is a client advocate at the Queens Defenders. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4065.08s)]
*  And I don't wear that as a feather in my cap, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4069.08s)]
*  but that was just me. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4073.08s)]
*  It was validation that if I get behind this man [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4076.08s)]
*  and give him new life, do my part in it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4080.08s)]
*  Lord knows there were others. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4085.08s)]
*  Steve Zeidman at CUNY Law School. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4086.08s)]
*  And if it wasn't for general honesty, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4091.08s)]
*  I'm adamant about to this day, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4093.08s)]
*  if it wasn't for Josh and Allison Hart actually going to, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4095.08s)]
*  and Derek as well, Derek Hamilton, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4100.08s)]
*  speaking to the district attorney, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4102.08s)]
*  we were at a plateau where they just didn't, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4104.08s)]
*  they just was like, nah. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4108.08s)]
*  But I don't want it to be about me at all. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4110.08s)]
*  Here's what I wanted to say, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4112.08s)]
*  is that you now are seeing the connections. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4113.08s)]
*  And so Legal Aid was representing Bruce. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4117.08s)]
*  There was an army of people that all believed [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4122.08s)]
*  that he could make change happen [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4125.08s)]
*  and do positive things when he got out. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4127.08s)]
*  So now he's a client advocate at the Queens Defenders [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4129.08s)]
*  doing this kind of work, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4132.08s)]
*  trying to explain to judges, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4135.08s)]
*  this person, don't let them be another Sheldon Johnson. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4137.08s)]
*  Don't let them be another me or Derek Hamilton. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4142.08s)]
*  They deserve counseling. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4146.08s)]
*  They deserve a second chance. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4148.08s)]
*  They deserve to help really be rehabilitated. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4149.08s)]
*  And then Sheldon comes over [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4153.08s)]
*  and starts working at the Queens Defenders, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4156.08s)]
*  which is, it's like the appointed counsel [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4159.08s)]
*  for people that can't afford an attorney, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4165.08s)]
*  they're criminal defense lawyers. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4169.08s)]
*  So to watch them out there advocating [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4171.08s)]
*  and trying to change hearts and minds about the community, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4176.08s)]
*  you have to be on the ground doing it [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4180.08s)]
*  and getting in front of people. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4182.08s)]
*  And I know I said it before, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4184.08s)]
*  I'm very thoughtful in who I bring with me. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4188.08s)]
*  Look at this beautiful mind [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4191.08s)]
*  and how he articulates himself and educated himself. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4193.08s)]
*  And you want to tell me [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4196.08s)]
*  that this couldn't have happened earlier? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4198.08s)]
*  He doesn't need anyone's sympathy [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4202.08s)]
*  and he's not asking for it. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4206.08s)]
*  It's something I admire quite a bit about him. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4207.08s)]
*  Whenever anybody, he doesn't want poor Sheldon, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4210.08s)]
*  how could you have gone through this? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4214.08s)]
*  And he stops them. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4216.08s)]
*  I've seen him do it right in their tracks. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4217.08s)]
*  Listen, I just don't know that my life was worth throwing away. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4219.08s)]
*  But to watch them now on the other side of it, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4224.08s)]
*  the change that we talked about that I'm like, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4227.08s)]
*  how do we change it? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4229.08s)]
*  How do we do it? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4230.08s)]
*  It's starting to happen. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4231.08s)]
*  Could we use Jeff Bezos to sit down [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4233.08s)]
*  and think through how we can build a community center [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4239.08s)]
*  in East New York, in Harlem? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4243.08s)]
*  Yeah, we could. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4246.08s)]
*  The means are out there to do it. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4248.08s)]
*  All it takes is one person listening to this episode [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4251.08s)]
*  that tells someone, that knows someone, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4255.08s)]
*  and then progress is starting to happen [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4258.08s)]
*  and we can just do it on the ground. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4261.08s)]
*  But the reason why I mentioned Scared Straight is because, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4263.08s)]
*  sure, I could go in there and talk to these kids. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4266.08s)]
*  They're not going to fucking listen to me. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4269.08s)]
*  They're just not. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4271.08s)]
*  I might be certified, but I'm not qualified. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4272.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4279.08s)]
*  I didn't, I can't, I can sympathize, but I can't empathize. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4280.08s)]
*  You know, I go through that talking sometimes, like, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4287.08s)]
*  you know, to fighters that I manage, right? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4291.08s)]
*  I do it with Shakur Stevenson. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4294.08s)]
*  You know, he's like a little brother to me. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4296.08s)]
*  I love him. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4299.08s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like, you know, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4300.08s)]
*  the message might be better coming from Jay Prince [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4303.08s)]
*  than it is from me because he's more qualified. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4306.08s)]
*  I try to wrap my head around what Shakur went through as a kid [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4309.08s)]
*  and growing up in Newark and the circumstance, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4313.08s)]
*  but, you know, I think that there is a disconnect, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4315.08s)]
*  and I have to be big enough to recognize that [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4318.08s)]
*  and say, yeah, you know, maybe I'm not the right person, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4321.08s)]
*  but, you know, you're telling me he's not going to, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4325.08s)]
*  and they're doing it. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4328.08s)]
*  They're getting judges to change their mind. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4329.08s)]
*  They're getting prosecutors to think twice. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4331.08s)]
*  We just got one guy. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4334.08s)]
*  He shot at his brother [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4335.08s)]
*  without going into the details of his case. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4341.08s)]
*  He has attempted murder charge, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4343.08s)]
*  and we now have him in our program. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4345.08s)]
*  They originally were talking about giving him 15 years. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4348.08s)]
*  He's been in our program for a couple of months. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4351.08s)]
*  We set him up. We help him get his resume. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4354.08s)]
*  He's working towards his GED, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4356.08s)]
*  and he's in the hood coding program. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4358.08s)]
*  We also have him in an aggression replacement training program. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4360.08s)]
*  And now the district attorney is considering [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4363.08s)]
*  giving him five years probation. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4366.08s)]
*  So they went from 15 years, and this kid is doing amazing. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4369.08s)]
*  Like, he's just picking up the coding. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4374.08s)]
*  The guy that I spoke to, he said that this kid is just, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4377.08s)]
*  he's like a sponge. He's just soaking it up so fast. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4381.08s)]
*  But this is just one example of how we kind of level the playing field [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4384.08s)]
*  and create opportunities. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4389.08s)]
*  I think that key, that word you spoke about earlier, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4391.08s)]
*  is so crucial to the context of this conversation. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4394.08s)]
*  Opportunities, right? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4399.08s)]
*  How do we create the opportunities [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4401.08s)]
*  for these kids to be able to provide? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4403.08s)]
*  Living in New York City ain't no joke, man. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4405.08s)]
*  The cost of living is ridiculous. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4407.08s)]
*  So how do we create these opportunities? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4411.08s)]
*  How do we, so now also what we're doing, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4413.08s)]
*  we're going to the schools, we're talking to the teachers. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4415.08s)]
*  We're talking to the teachers and the principals, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4418.08s)]
*  and we're asking them, we're not even going to wait [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4420.08s)]
*  until you get to the courtroom. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4423.08s)]
*  We're asking the teachers and the principals, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4425.08s)]
*  who in your classroom do you think needs help? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4427.08s)]
*  Which kids in your classroom are the most, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4432.08s)]
*  giving you the most trouble? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4434.08s)]
*  And they give us the names, and we go and we talk to them, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4436.08s)]
*  and we're getting them involved in our program. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4438.08s)]
*  But it's all about opportunity. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4441.08s)]
*  Well, kids sometimes need to see someone, not sometimes, always, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4444.08s)]
*  need to see someone who's done something [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4449.08s)]
*  from a similar situation. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4452.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4454.08s)]
*  Where they realize, like, there's a path out of this. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4455.08s)]
*  Because if you don't see a path out of this, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4458.08s)]
*  you just see a path towards doing what the other people [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4460.08s)]
*  in your environment are doing. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4462.08s)]
*  And that's how all human beings react. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4464.08s)]
*  If you're in a bad environment with a bad group of human beings, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4466.08s)]
*  the chances of you going down that same path are extraordinary. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4470.08s)]
*  Environment and behavior. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4474.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4475.08s)]
*  And from someone like you, they can see this is not a given. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4477.08s)]
*  There's a way to do this. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4482.08s)]
*  There's a way to get out of this. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4483.08s)]
*  And there's a guy who's already gone the wrong way who could say, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4484.08s)]
*  you know what, I figured it out, and I'm going to help you. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4487.08s)]
*  And the difference between someone like you saying it [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4492.08s)]
*  versus some uninspired counselor is massive. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4494.08s)]
*  It's massive. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4499.08s)]
*  And it speaks to you and your character that you want to do this, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4500.08s)]
*  that you've dedicated yourself to doing this. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4504.08s)]
*  That's where real change comes from. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4506.08s)]
*  That's where real help comes from. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4508.08s)]
*  Real help comes from someone, as you said, who's qualified to do it. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4510.08s)]
*  Comes from the same place that you came from and that you can identify. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4514.08s)]
*  Because being able to identify is a critical component, like you said. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4517.08s)]
*  Like, you know, is this someone who can identify, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4522.08s)]
*  empathize with what I'm going through, where I'm at right now in my life? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4528.08s)]
*  Like a lot of the young kids, they're involved in the gangs. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4533.08s)]
*  And we have this reculturalization program, right, [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4538.08s)]
*  where we're trying to teach them, because in many of our communities, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4543.08s)]
*  the gangs have become a part of the culture. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4547.08s)]
*  Like, you have parents who are gang members. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4550.08s)]
*  You've got the kids who are in communities. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4552.08s)]
*  And it's just saturated with gang culture, language, dress, music, food, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4555.08s)]
*  everything else. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4565.08s)]
*  So we're trying to extract them out of these places and say, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4567.08s)]
*  okay, this is something that you can do differently. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4570.08s)]
*  We're taking them to different places. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4573.08s)]
*  We're taking them to HBCU so that they can see what people who look like them [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4575.08s)]
*  look like when they're going to college. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4580.08s)]
*  This can be you. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4582.08s)]
*  This is some of the take them into classrooms to meet with the professors. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4583.08s)]
*  We have a financial literacy course where Chase Bank actually works with us, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4588.08s)]
*  and we teach them how to establish credit, how to open up a checking account, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4593.08s)]
*  how to open up a savings account. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4597.08s)]
*  And at the end of that particular five-week program, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4598.08s)]
*  we actually take them to the bank and we give them $25 so that they can open up [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4602.08s)]
*  their own bank account so that they can understand the difference between [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4606.08s)]
*  the money that you obtain from the streets and the money that you get working [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4609.08s)]
*  legitimately is two different kinds of money. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4612.08s)]
*  You can't appreciate the money that you get from the streets, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4615.08s)]
*  but that money that you've been working all week for, eight hours a day, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4619.08s)]
*  40 hours a week at the end of the week, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4623.08s)]
*  and you can see that direct deposit when it goes into your account. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4625.08s)]
*  You can take that card and you can actually utilize it to withdraw your money [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4628.08s)]
*  out the bank. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4632.08s)]
*  That's a big difference. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4633.08s)]
*  Civic engagement. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4636.08s)]
*  How can some of these kids feel like they have a voice in their communities [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4637.08s)]
*  when they're not making no decisions in their communities? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4642.08s)]
*  We go into the rallies. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4646.08s)]
*  We take them to the rallies out of Albany. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4647.08s)]
*  Yesterday they went to a rally. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4649.08s)]
*  Last week we went to a rally about treatment, not jails, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4650.08s)]
*  how to set up what they call diversion courts for people who have substance [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4653.08s)]
*  abuse problems. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4660.08s)]
*  Instead of sending them to prison, they need treatment. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4662.08s)]
*  And the money that they save is clear. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4665.08s)]
*  It's clear. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4668.08s)]
*  When you do the math, the money that you save, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4669.08s)]
*  it costs almost up to $70,000 to incarcerate one person. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4671.08s)]
*  But then there's the issue of privatized prisons, which is insane. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4677.08s)]
*  That's disturbing. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4681.08s)]
*  It's so disturbing. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4682.08s)]
*  They're using human beings as batteries to generate money. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4683.08s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4687.08s)]
*  Yeah, we're trying to take the charge out of their battery. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4688.08s)]
*  We're trying to pull the plug out of the wall because these aren't [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4693.08s)]
*  controversial statistics, and I'm not going to start spewing them, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4697.08s)]
*  but we incarcerate at a rate that dwarfs any other Western country, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4701.08s)]
*  any other civilized country. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4710.08s)]
*  Anywhere in the world, really. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4713.08s)]
*  So in any event, I was doing a relative comparison. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4715.08s)]
*  So how do we put those privatized prisons out of business? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4718.08s)]
*  We have to start on the ground. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4723.08s)]
*  It's almost like a rallying cry to myself because we get a lot of, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4726.08s)]
*  not a rallying cry to myself, but a lot of people are like, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4733.08s)]
*  not a rallying cry to myself, but the way I got from being a little [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4739.08s)]
*  less intimidated by the mountain to climb was taking a step back, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4746.08s)]
*  really after the last episode, and saying, well, what have we done [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4753.08s)]
*  and how have we changed things? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4756.08s)]
*  Listen, I wasn't born a civil rights lawyer that was working on [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4758.08s)]
*  innocence cases. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4763.08s)]
*  I have a trial strategy company called DRC. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4764.08s)]
*  We do focus groups, mock trials on big cases, right? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4768.08s)]
*  Try to unfold the thinking of jurors in a jurisdiction where the case [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4772.08s)]
*  is going to be tried, and we make demonstrative aides, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4777.08s)]
*  and we are alleged experts in jury selection. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4780.08s)]
*  And that became a platform. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4783.08s)]
*  I said, how can we use this as a platform now that I'm operating [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4786.08s)]
*  in the Perlmutter Center as well? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4791.08s)]
*  So just being in the boxing industry, speaking to Jay-Z's team at [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4794.08s)]
*  Roc Nation and Jay-Z and his mom, how can we do this? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4801.08s)]
*  And he has something called the Sean Carter Foundation. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4805.08s)]
*  It's a remarkable, it flies way under the radar. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4809.08s)]
*  Have you ever heard of it? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4812.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4813.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4814.08s)]
*  Do you know what it does? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4815.08s)]
*  Not exactly. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4816.08s)]
*  All right. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4817.08s)]
*  It's kind of remarkable that people know it because of his name, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4818.08s)]
*  and they've heard it, but no one really knows what it does. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4824.08s)]
*  They take children from really from all over the country. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4827.08s)]
*  A lot of them are in the tri-state area that have difficult circumstances. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4832.08s)]
*  A lot of them come from single-family households, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4837.08s)]
*  and they're not just mentoring them from high school, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4840.08s)]
*  but they are trying to do some of the things that Sheldon talked about. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4847.08s)]
*  They do a college tour. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4852.08s)]
*  It's run by a woman named Danya Diaz and really Gloria Carter [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4854.08s)]
*  and a woman named Miss Archer. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4860.08s)]
*  And I saw what they were doing, and I said, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4862.08s)]
*  If we took these kids and created a fellowship program [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4865.08s)]
*  where we pay their last year of college, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4869.08s)]
*  and five of them do it every summer [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4872.08s)]
*  and work on wrongful conviction cases at my consulting firm at DRC, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4876.08s)]
*  and also are a resource to my students who are taking an internship [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4881.08s)]
*  for the Perlmutter Center and are working on wrongful conviction cases, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4886.08s)]
*  and have them start a social media campaign. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4890.08s)]
*  They spearheaded the Free Bruce Bryant social media campaign. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4895.08s)]
*  And watching this program, these kids, if they're given the opportunity, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4899.08s)]
*  three of them now work for me full-time. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4906.08s)]
*  One of them is the mail intake coordinator at the Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4909.08s)]
*  So she is receiving mail from inmates [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4914.08s)]
*  and helping screen which cases we might want to investigate. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4917.08s)]
*  Her name is Samilia McFarland. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4921.08s)]
*  There's an old girl that works at my firm doing advertising and publicity. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4923.08s)]
*  Her name is Jala Madri. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4930.08s)]
*  She made a presentation to me the other day. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4932.08s)]
*  I was fucking blown away that this girl was, she was passionate about marketing, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4935.08s)]
*  not advertising, marketing. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4941.08s)]
*  And she works at my consulting firm, and she made a presentation to me, you know, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4944.08s)]
*  that had a level of detail and ideas about how we can become, you know, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4950.08s)]
*  increase our awareness. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4957.08s)]
*  And I was just thinking to myself, you know, all right, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4959.08s)]
*  so this is the change that we're making happen. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4962.08s)]
*  And it was just an idea that I had. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4965.08s)]
*  I didn't actually think that Jay-Z and his mom and Donnie would go for it. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4967.08s)]
*  So I was reluctant to pitch them the idea and just being able to say, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4973.08s)]
*  well, what do you have to lose by, you know, putting it out there? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4978.08s)]
*  And they have been remarkably supportive. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4981.08s)]
*  So I think that, like, there's a lot of people that want to help. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4984.08s)]
*  You know, Sheldon and I were talking about it before we came, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4988.08s)]
*  and we often think, like, how can listeners help? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4991.08s)]
*  There is not, if you have an idea like I had, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4995.08s)]
*  just try to put the next foot in front of the foot that's behind you. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=4998.08s)]
*  And just keep walking forward and don't be afraid to ask. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5002.08s)]
*  There is not a public defender's office in this country. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5006.08s)]
*  There is not a civic engagement organization that if you call them and say, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5010.08s)]
*  I want to volunteer or I'm interested in helping, that will turn you away. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5016.08s)]
*  You just have to say, all right, I could sit here and talk about it and, you know... [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5023.08s)]
*  Until it happens to you, right? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5030.08s)]
*  You know, we talk about not to cut you off, right? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5033.08s)]
*  No, I need cutting off. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5036.08s)]
*  You talk about, like, remember the opioid crisis, right? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5038.08s)]
*  You know, it's been an opioid crisis in my community since I can remember. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5041.08s)]
*  People were dying off heroin. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5045.08s)]
*  And it didn't become an issue until it was affecting white America, right? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5047.08s)]
*  But my thing is, had you dealt with it from the beginning, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5053.08s)]
*  it would have never became a situation later on. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5057.08s)]
*  So it's this idea where people, we have a tendency to say, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5060.08s)]
*  okay, I'm just going to turn away and I'm not going to pay attention to it. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5063.08s)]
*  I'm going to turn a blind eye. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5067.08s)]
*  I'm going to act like it doesn't exist until it hits home. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5068.08s)]
*  And then sometime when it hits home, it's too late. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5071.08s)]
*  Yeah, like, I think it takes, like, something to happen to somebody [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5075.08s)]
*  for them to become an advocate, right? [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5081.08s)]
*  Michael J. Fox wasn't a Parkinson's advocate until it happened for her. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5084.08s)]
*  But that's great that he decided to do that. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5088.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5090.08s)]
*  Remarkable. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5091.08s)]
*  But I think that Sheldon makes a great point, right? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5092.08s)]
*  We're a society that likes to sit back and complain. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5097.08s)]
*  We want to react instead of responding. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5105.08s)]
*  Like, one of my favorite things to do is I have severe anxiety about dying. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5108.08s)]
*  But for whatever reason, maybe this balances me out at an airport [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5116.08s)]
*  when a flight gets canceled, even if it's hopefully my flight. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5122.08s)]
*  Not hopefully, but I get a better view of it if it's my flight. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5127.08s)]
*  To watch people stand up and, you know, get frustrated, berate, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5132.08s)]
*  raise their voice at the fucking ticket attendant, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5141.08s)]
*  it's a remarkable exercise and it's a social experiment, I think, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5147.08s)]
*  that if people really were able to hover over the room and watch themselves, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5153.08s)]
*  they'd be like, why am I yelling at the ticket attendant? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5157.08s)]
*  There's only two real possibilities of why this plane is not going to fly on time. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5160.08s)]
*  There's either a mechanical problem or weather. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5166.08s)]
*  Do you want to fly in either of those situations? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5169.08s)]
*  And to watch people just complain and they get, I don't know what they're getting out of it, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5174.08s)]
*  but I just find myself trying to A, have an awareness about myself not to do that [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5181.08s)]
*  and rather than get intimidated by the problem, try to just keep putting one foot in front of another. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5189.08s)]
*  And then when the flight gets canceled, maybe I could read something interesting and catch up. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5196.08s)]
*  It's inconvenient or come up with an idea. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5202.08s)]
*  I mean, trust me, I'm an average guy of average intelligence that just, I think I have like more tenacity. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5205.08s)]
*  So I don't, if I can help make some of this stuff happen, other people can make it happen. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5215.08s)]
*  And I, Sheldon asked me, should I go to law school before we came here? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5221.08s)]
*  And I said, I can't. I changed my mind, by the way. I might have an opinion now. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5226.08s)]
*  But I told them like most of the lawyers that I find that are most effective aren't the smartest. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5230.08s)]
*  They're not the savviest. They possess something that most lawyers don't, which is common sense and street smarts. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5236.08s)]
*  And they marry that with what they learned in school. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5251.08s)]
*  And they're able to sort of that perfect stew, I think, is what leads to a successful advocate, counselor, attorney, whatever you are. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5255.08s)]
*  And oftentimes there's so much of an emphasis placed on your grades and what score did you get? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5266.08s)]
*  And how much of that really ends up fucking mattering at the end of the day? It matters. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5272.08s)]
*  But does it matter to the degree we place an emphasis on it in our society? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5277.08s)]
*  I'm not sure. But my whole thing is rather than like be intimidated by the problem, I think it's recognizing that it exists. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5283.08s)]
*  Just decide one discrete thing you want to do to try to help make a change happen. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5296.08s)]
*  And then, you know, again, just try to get some forward momentum and you'd be surprised at the buy in that you get. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5302.08s)]
*  I think that that's why this platform is so important because it allows people to start sharing ideas, reaching out to us, and we're taking them up on it. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5310.08s)]
*  I've told you before, we've been contacted by, you know, a major law firm, Greenberg Trorig, and, you know, a really awesome attorney that's working on the case of Pierre Rushing. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5321.08s)]
*  This guy, Jordan Grotzinger, who's just thought he was a corporate attorney. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5333.08s)]
*  Had nothing to do with this kind of work. Listen to the podcast. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5338.08s)]
*  He's a passionate, passionate advocate. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5342.08s)]
*  And he's going to get justice one of these days for Peter Rushing. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5346.08s)]
*  We've tried to help apply pressure through this show by having people reach out to the DA and write letters on his behalf. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5350.08s)]
*  It's, you know, has it worked yet? It's working. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5360.08s)]
*  We're going to get there at some point. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5364.08s)]
*  So, you know, that's my objective, you know, with continuing to do these stories, because you're right. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5367.08s)]
*  The privatization of prisons and the industrial prison complex, is that a solvable problem? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5376.08s)]
*  I'm not sure. I think it's, I think that it's too much of a giant to slay unless we start pulling the electrodes, not the Neuralink electrodes, pulling the electrodes out of the sockets and taking energy out of it as much as we can until they're like, well, we don't have any fucking people. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5384.08s)]
*  You begin sabotaging pieces of the machine, right? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5408.08s)]
*  Because, you know, a lot of these corporations are what you call well-oiled machines, right? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5411.08s)]
*  And it's like a watch. When you open up a watch, you see so many intricate pieces, right? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5418.08s)]
*  And if you sometimes, if you break the right piece in the watch, the whole watch ceases to keep time. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5422.08s)]
*  And it's just, you know, it's just a poor excuse for, it's like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound, you know, for the government to allow these corporations to privatize and say, okay, okay, it's not our problem anymore. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5434.08s)]
*  We're going to pass the buck and let somebody else deal with it. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5450.08s)]
*  Now you have these corporations who they really don't, they really don't care about, you know, rights and humanity and cruel and unusual punishment and due process. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5455.08s)]
*  They don't care about none of this stuff. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5465.08s)]
*  Well, to allow it to exist in the first place, you have to ignore that people will be incentivized like every other industry, like the pharmaceutical industry, like the military industrial complex, like everything else. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5467.08s)]
*  Once they start acting as a corporation, which all corporations, it is in their best interest to try to maximize the amount of profits they make always. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5480.08s)]
*  If they have shareholders, it's their responsibility to those shareholders to maximize profits with each quarter. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5490.08s)]
*  Now, when that happens with human beings in prisons, you can bet your fucking sweet ass they're going to lock as many people up as they can. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5496.08s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5504.08s)]
*  That's their commodity. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5505.08s)]
*  We know for a fact that happened. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5506.08s)]
*  We know for a fact that prison guard unions, they work hard to make sure that laws are not changed that will incarcerate people for petty drug offenses. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5507.08s)]
*  Big business. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5517.08s)]
*  Big business. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5518.08s)]
*  For example, I was supposed to go testify at a congressional Senate hearing on what they call slave wages, right? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5519.08s)]
*  So you have this corporation called Corcraft. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5528.08s)]
*  I don't know how familiar you are with Corcraft. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5531.08s)]
*  Is that when they use prisoners? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5533.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5535.08s)]
*  They use prisoners. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5536.08s)]
*  At Auburn, they make license plates. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5537.08s)]
*  At Clinton Correctional Facility, they make mattresses and t-shirts and underwear. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5539.08s)]
*  Each facility has a different dance. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5543.08s)]
*  I was just reading an article today about that. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5544.08s)]
*  I was just reading an article today about food manufacturers that use prisoners to sell commercial food. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5546.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5554.08s)]
*  And they essentially work as slaves. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5555.08s)]
*  That's quick chill. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5557.08s)]
*  So you have a whole bunch of different entities under this one large umbrella, right? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5558.08s)]
*  And I remember I was getting paid $0.17 an hour at one point in time, $0.19 an hour, for operating these big machines. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5565.08s)]
*  And they were producing just like a mass amount of... [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5576.08s)]
*  Corcraft is actually a Fortune 500 corporation. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5579.08s)]
*  And they function. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5584.08s)]
*  And they regulate out of the prison industrial complex. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5586.08s)]
*  There it is. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5590.08s)]
*  U.S. prisons is part of a hidden workforce linked to hundreds of popular food brands. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5591.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5595.08s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5596.08s)]
*  Frosted flakes. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5597.08s)]
*  So a lot of times we walk into the supermarket and we see these products and we don't realize what's going into making these products. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5598.08s)]
*  You hear about these slave shops in China and all of this stuff. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5607.08s)]
*  And people campaign to say, oh, well, we're not going to support that. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5612.08s)]
*  But what are you actually supporting here in your own country? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5615.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5619.08s)]
*  Right now. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5620.08s)]
*  Unbeknownst to you. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5621.08s)]
*  Unbeknownst to you, right? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5622.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5623.08s)]
*  And I mean, if you have a label on everything you buy, like this may contain harmful substances, this may be bad for your health. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5624.08s)]
*  GMOs. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5631.08s)]
*  Why the fuck don't you have a label? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5632.08s)]
*  This is made by prisoners. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5634.08s)]
*  This is made by people making $0.13 an hour or whatever it is. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5635.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5638.08s)]
*  How do you not have that? [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5639.08s)]
*  Because wouldn't that change the way people would buy things? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5641.08s)]
*  Well, and the most important. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5643.08s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5646.08s)]
*  Including countries that, OK. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5647.08s)]
*  So the goods are prisoners produce wind up in the supply chains of a dizzying array of products found in most American kitchens from frosted flake cereals, ballpark hot dogs to gold metal flour, Coca-Cola and rice land rice. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5649.08s)]
*  They're on the shelves of virtually every supermarket in the country, including Kroger, Target, Aldi and Whole Foods. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5663.08s)]
*  Some goods are exported, including the countries that have had products blocked from entering the US for using forced or prison label. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5671.08s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5679.08s)]
*  13th Amendment. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5680.08s)]
*  Yep. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5681.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5682.08s)]
*  Slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5683.08s)]
*  And we go back to Jim Crow. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5687.08s)]
*  That's what they did. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5689.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5690.08s)]
*  Right after the Emancipation Proclamation, post antebellum, you know, they created these laws to convict the freed slaves so that they can continue to force them into free labor. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5691.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5705.08s)]
*  And it just continues today, like 13th Senate hour, 17th Senate hour, 19th Senate hour. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5706.08s)]
*  During the pandemic, Great Meadows Correctional Facility had these guys working 24 hours a day making hand sanitizers in mass. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5710.08s)]
*  That place is the scariest fucking place. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5721.08s)]
*  That place traumatized me. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5724.08s)]
*  That place is like, it was one of the first prisons that I went to in New York State to visit with a potential client. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5725.08s)]
*  And I almost peed down my leg. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5732.08s)]
*  I mean, it looks like, feels like, is like what you saw in the Shawshank Redemption. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5736.08s)]
*  Swarovski and Attica. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5743.08s)]
*  Check this out. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5744.08s)]
*  What you're seeing on the screen is not some new thing. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5745.08s)]
*  You know, speaking of the Shawshank Redemption, Stephen King writes a lot that is rooted, I'm not talking about Cujo. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5749.08s)]
*  I'm not talking about, you know, his horror writing. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5759.08s)]
*  His short stories, most of them are rooted in some sort of truth. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5762.08s)]
*  Rita Hayworth in the Shawshank Redemption was a short story that he wrote that ended up getting made. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5767.08s)]
*  I think it was part of Apt. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5772.08s)]
*  Pupil or one of his books of short stories. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5773.08s)]
*  And you remember in the Shawshank Redemption where they had this precise thing where it was they came up with this idea, you know, the warden came up with an idea for a work program where they were profiting. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5776.08s)]
*  That was true back then. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5788.08s)]
*  He was basing that on something that was happening in the Northeast back then. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5790.08s)]
*  So, you know, the notion that this is still happening shouldn't be that shocking. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5794.08s)]
*  It's just like, what is what is our news cycle? [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5801.08s)]
*  Pay attention to, you know, and, you know, and how do you how do you make sure that this kind of stuff doesn't keep happening? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5804.08s)]
*  My idea is you need people on the ground that are working on policy and reform. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5812.08s)]
*  So at the Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice at Cardozo, we have a policy advisor. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5820.08s)]
*  She's our name is Sarah Chu, who knows forensics. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5827.08s)]
*  She's a scientist and like one of the more respected in my mind, the most respected reform advocate about how we stop using junk science like bite marks and and you know, blood splatter, blood splatter, ballistics, even fingerprints to some extent. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5831.08s)]
*  And yeah, and lobbying to make sure that laws get changed. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5848.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's like at the end of the day, the scariest part about all of this is that the politicians that we poke fun at, I poke fun at everybody has a field day. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5854.08s)]
*  These are the fucking people. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5867.08s)]
*  These are the people that are sitting in some white fucking building. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5870.08s)]
*  The prosecutors and the prosecutors are the worst. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5874.08s)]
*  And well, before you get to the prosecutors, these are the people writing the laws. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5877.08s)]
*  These are the people writing the statutes. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5881.08s)]
*  They need to be influenced by people like Sarah Chu, other great people that work in policy and reform advocate. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5884.08s)]
*  There's a woman named Rebecca Brown, her and Sarah Chu. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5892.08s)]
*  Both used to be at the Innocence Project. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5895.08s)]
*  Sarah came to work with me. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5897.08s)]
*  Rebecca Brown is a great one that are working boots on the ground and trying to change and educate really. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5899.08s)]
*  I mean, how much does your local representative or a state senator really know about how dangerous it could be to draw conclusions about the directionality of how blood hits drywall versus how it hits lucite? [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5906.08s)]
*  How bite marks leave an indentation on someone's skin? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5926.08s)]
*  You could, I could, a qualified, certified actually, strike qualified, a certified odontologist, totally, total horse shit, could take one of these skulls and make the same case that the bite marks left on someone's leg came from this side. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5932.08s)]
*  The bite marks left on someone's leg came from this set of teeth, Sheldon's teeth, your teeth or my teeth, and convince four juries four times, 100% of the time. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5955.08s)]
*  That you're guilty. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5966.08s)]
*  That you're guilty. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5967.08s)]
*  A skilled odontologist could do that. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5968.08s)]
*  When bite marks were, you know, became subject of a report that everybody should read, the National Academy of Sciences did a report in 2009 that should have changed our criminal justice system. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5970.08s)]
*  It had the most, the most qualified, certified scientists from all over the world study all of these disciplines of forensic evidence, all of these disciplines of forensic science and come to the conclusions that none of them, none of them were supported by scientifically, a scientifically credible body of evidence. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=5985.08s)]
*  They weren't, there was no repeatability. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6011.08s)]
*  There was no reliability. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6013.08s)]
*  The scientific method that you learn in grade school, could you could apply it to any of them and they would all fail the test. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6015.08s)]
*  Which are the standards for admissions at trial. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6021.08s)]
*  And it talks about, it talks about the standards for admissions at trial, the Daubert standard, the Frye standard. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6023.08s)]
*  It's just, is it credible in the scientific community? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6028.08s)]
*  And they come to a resounding no on everything except for DNA. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6031.08s)]
*  And DNA is still fraught right now because there are all these new technologies. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6036.08s)]
*  I shake your hand this morning and then I later pick up a knife and, you know, stab someone and your DNA ends up on the knife. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6041.08s)]
*  From the sweat on his hand. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6050.08s)]
*  Yeah, because there is such sensitive, what they call low copy or touch DNA that can now be detective, that can now be detected. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6051.08s)]
*  And the mixture can be untangled and they can say, well, Joe Rogan's DNA is on the knife. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6061.08s)]
*  Where was he at this time? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6068.08s)]
*  There's a case of a guy named Emmanuel Fair in Seattle where he was implicated in a murder because he was at a party on Halloween when this girl got murdered. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6070.08s)]
*  He ended up getting, you know, sitting in prison for I think seven or eight years before he finally got acquitted. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6078.08s)]
*  So this report should have turned forensic science on its head and no one gives a fuck. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6086.08s)]
*  Bite mark evidence. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6093.08s)]
*  Until it hits home. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6095.08s)]
*  Well, bite mark evidence is still admissible in all 50 states. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6096.08s)]
*  So, I mean, you know, look, we could sit, I could sit and bang my head against the wall about it or I could, you know, just keep on speaking up when you're in front of a judge. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6101.08s)]
*  How often, Sheldon, do you hear from an attorney, well, I don't want to piss off the judge. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6111.08s)]
*  All the time. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6115.08s)]
*  Your right, your absolute obligation when you're defending someone is to piss off the judge if they're not doing their job. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6116.08s)]
*  To protect their rights, their constitutional rights. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6126.08s)]
*  That's what the Constitution was designed for. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6130.08s)]
*  And it's so interesting when you think about the Constitution, right, and the founding fathers and the Bill of Rights and how it has just transferred over hundreds of years. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6132.08s)]
*  And to today and how our rights are still fundamentally protected. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6143.08s)]
*  But, you know, when we talk about when we talk about rights, there's two different worlds. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6149.08s)]
*  Like, you know, his rights and my rights may be two different kinds of rights because of where we come from and because the color of our skin, unfortunately. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6153.08s)]
*  I answer prevention is worth a pound of cure. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6163.08s)]
*  And you and you constantly keep hitting on the fact that, you know, why do you wait for a problem to end up at your doorstep before you decide to do something about it? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6165.08s)]
*  You know, you have like he said, you have people at all of these different organizations reach out. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6177.08s)]
*  Google is very effective. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6184.08s)]
*  I've only been home nine months and I've pretty much learned how to how to navigate Google pretty good. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6186.08s)]
*  Better than most. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6192.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's actually pretty easy to be able to find different organizations like he talks about the people at his organization, Sarah Chu. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6194.08s)]
*  And we have Gina Mitchell at Queens Defenders, who is our policy coordinator. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6203.08s)]
*  And we work on so many different subjects. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6209.08s)]
*  Reach out. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6212.08s)]
*  Reach out. Change is real. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6214.08s)]
*  But it has to it has to begin somewhere. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6216.08s)]
*  You have to just be willing to take a step forward. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6219.08s)]
*  It doesn't matter where you from, how old you are, Republican, Democrat, rich, poor, black, white. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6221.08s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6229.08s)]
*  You know, I look like I took a picture of a guy, homeless guy on the train station a couple of days ago, and I posted it on my Instagram page. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6231.08s)]
*  And it just blows me away how. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6240.08s)]
*  And I'm just going to be straight. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6245.08s)]
*  I'm kind of I have an issue with the whole immigration thing because I feel like like he said, like Joe said earlier, like you have 70 million dollars that you can give to a whole another country yet. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6247.08s)]
*  You know, you're not addressing the issues right here at home right now. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6258.08s)]
*  Like, you know, I worked for Department of Homeless Shelters. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6263.08s)]
*  I've worked in there. I've seen it with my own two eyes. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6267.08s)]
*  Like, and then you have citizens, you have veterans that come back from wars and can't even get the same services that people from other countries come here and get immediately. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6270.08s)]
*  They get housing vouchers. They get education vouchers to everything. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6279.08s)]
*  Like, you know, make America great again. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6283.08s)]
*  If you're going to make America great again. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6286.08s)]
*  Focus on the people, the citizens, the people who put you in office. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6290.08s)]
*  It's just I don't know. It's like, you know, what does that even mean? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6297.08s)]
*  Look, I've been reading what I've been reading this book called Thinking Fast and Slow. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6302.08s)]
*  Have you heard? It's a fucking phenomenal. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6306.08s)]
*  I highly recommend it. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6309.08s)]
*  It's about how your brain works and why we believe what we believe and the two systems of our brain. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6311.08s)]
*  And one is the quick judgment and the other is the slow it down and critically think about it. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6320.08s)]
*  And there are all these, you know, puzzles in it where he makes the point by saying, like, consider the following and the studies that have been done on someone just repeating the same words over and over again and how that translates into people feeling that it's a credible and B that the person [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6327.08s)]
*  uttering the words has some credibility or astounding just by keeping make them. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6349.08s)]
*  I mean, Trump might be, in my opinion, a little nuts, but he's, you know, a little crazy. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6356.08s)]
*  He's crazy like a fox, though. He knows if he keeps on saying those words, those those words are going to stick. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6363.08s)]
*  If he keeps saying witch hunt, people are going to start repeating it and they do. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6369.08s)]
*  So, you know, maybe think a little like I don't even know what it means. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6374.08s)]
*  I just know that we need to start like having some individual thought before we just like this group think about other people and you know how they're different and lock them up and throw away the key and, you know, I just think like we should all slow down and really think. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6381.08s)]
*  Yeah. And what I what I hope to bring is, is these stories where you get to know the person. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6401.08s)]
*  He's no outlook. I'm deeply deeply flawed. Sheldon we the first to tell you like, I did some fucked up things. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6407.08s)]
*  But when you when you watch what he's doing, you know, why can't, why can't we make people in these communities. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6416.08s)]
*  Why can't we make them great again by giving them a better chance. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6429.08s)]
*  Like you said at the outset of the episode, let them hit the starting line. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6435.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know what you were saying earlier about building a sandcastle when greenest at a time. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6439.08s)]
*  I think from my perspective, the feedback that I get, it's these conversations we've had. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6447.08s)]
*  We've had quite a few of them now. They they have changed a lot of people's ideas on how the prison prison system is structured, what the problems with it are, how many people are wrongfully incarcerated, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6454.08s)]
*  how incredible some of these people are wasted, potential locked away forever for something never did. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6468.08s)]
*  And they didn't break. Instead, they got stronger and wiser and more intelligent and more educated and came out better. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6474.08s)]
*  And they're they're they're incredible human beings. And how many of them are just being wasted? Yeah, that's my much potential. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6482.08s)]
*  I mean, this is what you want, though, right? You don't want you don't want somebody to go into the prison system and come out worse. Right. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6489.08s)]
*  And which happens, which happens, right? And then we hear about these horrific incidences or people getting pushed onto the train tracks because you have a guy who has a mental illness. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6495.08s)]
*  And instead of getting the services that he needs, you put him in prison. You sedated him for three, four years, five years. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6505.08s)]
*  You sent them to a parole board. The parole board let him out. Two days later, he pushes somebody into the train tracks. Right. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6512.08s)]
*  This is this is not what you want. Yeah. So how do you prevent these things from happening? Right. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6518.08s)]
*  By being proactive, by being responsive instead of being reactive. Don't wait for something to happen. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6524.08s)]
*  But you said something that Joe said, something that is worth sticking for on for a second. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6531.08s)]
*  These are most of the time, these are the miracles that are coming out. Right. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6538.08s)]
*  I mean, most of the time, you're right. The the cycle of from the street to prison, back to the street to prison, most of the time. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6543.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm just saying it in plain English. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6551.08s)]
*  Most of the time, it's churning out monsters because what else would you expect? Right. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6555.08s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's a great book called In the Belly of the Beast about a guy that went to prison and he describes what it did to him psychologically, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6563.08s)]
*  what it did to him, to every cell in his body. And then he goes out and he he murders someone. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6576.08s)]
*  And he writes this book just explaining, I want you to understand what this did to me. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6585.08s)]
*  I read it when I was in college and I should read it again. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6591.08s)]
*  I probably have a different perspective on it now. It might hit home even more. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6596.08s)]
*  But, you know, yeah, these are the these are talk about grains of sand on a beach. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6600.08s)]
*  You know, if you look at the population of people that keep getting churned out of correctional institutions, most of them are not getting corrected. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6606.08s)]
*  It take, you know, why do I like to spend my time with these guys? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6614.08s)]
*  Because I hope some of their strength rubs off on me somehow. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6619.08s)]
*  When I came home, right, in May, it took me almost 30 days to get any type of benefits or help. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6624.08s)]
*  And I had to call this lady. I called this guy. I put in for the snap, the food stamps, the benefits, the little bit of benefits that I have, right. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6633.08s)]
*  Or that I could that I could possibly acquire to help me navigate and kind of transition back and reintegrate back into society. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6640.08s)]
*  And I had a conversation with a lady on the phone and she told me she said, you don't qualify for emergency services. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6649.08s)]
*  And I said, what? I said, Miss, I just spent 25 years and five months incarcerated. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6657.08s)]
*  If that is not a qualification, then what is? Oh, sir, I'm just telling you, you don't qualify for it. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6666.08s)]
*  I said, I need to speak to your supervisor. It took me two days to get to her supervisor. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6671.08s)]
*  But when I finally got to her supervisor, her supervisor, oh, I'm going to look into it. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6676.08s)]
*  And they finally gave me my benefits. But I'm saying all of that to say that there's there's there's these institutions in place that need to change. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6681.08s)]
*  And for the people who are listening to this and you're directly involved in these institutions, there has to be a conscientious response to what classifies as an emergency. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6691.08s)]
*  A person should not. I should not have had to wait 30 days. What if what if I didn't have family resources? What if I didn't have anything? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6707.08s)]
*  And how much does that incentivize you to go right back to crime? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6714.08s)]
*  Right. You know what I'm saying? How much would that have incentivized me to go out and commit a robbery or steal a piece of pizza like a guy out in California where they have the three strikes laws and then I'm giving this guy 20 years for stealing a slice of pizza because he's starving. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6717.08s)]
*  This is this is real stuff. This is stuff that's really happening. Nobody offered me anything. I had to actually go out. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6732.08s)]
*  Do they give you any sort of guidelines of what you can do to reintegrate the society or do they just release you? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6741.08s)]
*  They just release you. They gave me $40. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6748.08s)]
*  And a bus ticket. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6754.08s)]
*  And I had a little I had a little J pay a debit card because I had a couple of dollars in my account that they gave me with a little bit extra money on it. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6757.08s)]
*  They have some programs that you're supposed to be entitled to prior to release. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6766.08s)]
*  But it's but it's a joke because the programs don't teach you any real skills. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6772.08s)]
*  Right. Like one of the one of the most one of the most significant hurdles I had upon my reintegration is was technology. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6778.08s)]
*  Right. I hadn't I've never I've never had a cell phone in my life. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6787.08s)]
*  I sent out my first email in 2019 from a tablet that they gave me an Auburn Correctional Facility. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6792.08s)]
*  I don't know what a PDF that I went online and they said I had to convert my application into a PDF before I could submit it. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6799.08s)]
*  Excuse my language. I didn't know what a PDF. What the fuck is that? [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6810.08s)]
*  You know so these are some of the things that when we when we talk about opportunities right and leveling the playing field and recidivism right. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6817.08s)]
*  Someone being able to get out and not have to be in these situations where they feel like the whole world is against them and they really don't know what to do. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6827.08s)]
*  They can't get the services that they need. They don't know how to navigate the basics of technology. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6837.08s)]
*  Microsoft Excel I was fortunate I was in the computer program while I was incarcerated and I was able to you know as my role in the Cornell Prison Education Program I put myself into a position to where I was. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6843.08s)]
*  I was I knew what Excel spreadsheet was. I knew what a Word document was but a lot of these guys that's coming out they don't know what that is. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6856.08s)]
*  But you skipped the PDF course. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6863.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6865.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6866.08s)]
*  I don't even know how to convert something to a PDF. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6869.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6871.08s)]
*  Like you know so. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6872.08s)]
*  Pretty simple. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6873.08s)]
*  I'm sure but I don't know how to do it. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6874.08s)]
*  Yeah I'm saying. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6875.08s)]
*  If I saw that in an email I'd be like fuck. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6876.08s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6878.08s)]
*  You know it's crazy you know there's a there's a great program in New York called Hudson Link. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6880.08s)]
*  Where they I think it's a college program and they do a lot of great reintegration. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6885.08s)]
*  They they provide a lot of great reintegration services and they're right like a few blocks from Sing Sing Prison and you were part of. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6892.08s)]
*  Shout out to Hudson Lake. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6901.08s)]
*  So I obtained my degree of mercy from Hudson Lake. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6903.08s)]
*  Sean Pika runs the organization amongst many other formerly incarcerated individuals. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6907.08s)]
*  Sean Pika is also formerly incarcerated. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6913.08s)]
*  They have a post-secondary education program on the inside and they also have a post-secondary. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6915.08s)]
*  They're actually paying for my master's right now to go back to school. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6921.08s)]
*  They have a housing reentry program called New Beginnings. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6925.08s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6929.08s)]
*  That's where I went when I first got released. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6930.08s)]
*  But you know going back had it not been for these these formerly incarcerated individuals like I don't know where I would have been. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6932.08s)]
*  Had I had to depend on my my elected representatives you know my elected assembly and senators like I would be you know I would probably be trying to steal a loaf of bread out the grocery store. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=6941.08s)]

*  When I saw him he told when Bruce got out he came to Hudson link. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7080.08s)]
*  They have like a it looks like a like a thrift shop and it kind of is but it's only for people getting out. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7087.08s)]
*  So you could go in and get some clothes. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7094.08s)]
*  You could go get. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7096.08s)]
*  That was Kiki's Kiki Dunstons. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7097.08s)]
*  That was her thrift shop. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7099.08s)]
*  She created that. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7100.08s)]
*  So I so when Bruce gets out he had needed clothes. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7101.08s)]
*  We said we'll bring you some clothes. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7104.08s)]
*  He said no Hudson link has this great little spot by. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7105.08s)]
*  So well while he was still the warden he came while Bruce was picking out things to congratulate him and wish him well. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7108.08s)]
*  And I so yeah I mean I not only did I talk to him as he told me when I retire I'm going to come work with these guys. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7117.08s)]
*  So yeah when I saw him at this event called the United Justice Coalition. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7124.08s)]
*  He's in a booth working for JJ on the Frederick Douglass side with us. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7128.08s)]
*  And I saw him and he looked at me and he goes I told you Josh. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7133.08s)]
*  And I just walked up I gave him a big hug. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7137.08s)]
*  He like recoiled. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7140.08s)]
*  I was like come on baby hug me. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7141.08s)]
*  And he came he came in he's like man it's like he's like it's life changing. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7144.08s)]
*  You know it really is. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7149.08s)]
*  And we had a great talk about it. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7150.08s)]
*  He was telling me how you know just being on the outside with these guys that I saw in you know not only in prison uniforms but in a construct that I was the head of. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7152.08s)]
*  And now they're the ones inspiring me. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7162.08s)]
*  We need more. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7164.08s)]
*  My cap is speaking of Michael Capra right. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7165.08s)]
*  So prior to my release we me and Bruce Bruce Bryant were working so hard to get this guy out of prison. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7168.08s)]
*  Me and Bruce Bruce Bryant were working so we created a number of programs. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7178.08s)]
*  One of them was a civic engagement in New York where we actually teach incarcerated individuals on their rights to vote how they vote how do you go to a booth how do you register to vote etc etc. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7183.08s)]
*  And Michael Capra was pivotal in allowing us to be able to create these programs and have a platform in the school building. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7195.08s)]
*  One of them in particular that we are trying to work on now is dyslexia right. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7204.08s)]
*  And this might this blew me away and it may you may see according to the Department of Correctional Education 47 percent of the incarcerated population all across the United States have some type of dyslexia or reading disability right. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7211.08s)]
*  That's almost half of the individuals that are in the Department of Corrections that have some type of reading disability right. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7228.08s)]
*  So when you look at and that's the tip of the iceberg right. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7237.08s)]
*  So when you look at the bottom of the iceberg right and you go and you delve even deeper into that right. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7240.08s)]
*  What are the key factors that played in this person actually you know what are the what's the correlation between incarceration and illiteracy right. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7246.08s)]
*  And there are there are currently no programs in any Department of Corrections throughout the United States that's actually screening men for dyslexia or to determine who can read and who can't read. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7256.08s)]
*  So so how do you wow. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7270.08s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7273.08s)]
*  However a study of Texas prison inmates by the University of Texas Medical Branch estimated that approximately 80 percent of prisoners and sample groups struggled with their literacy skills and that half were likely to be dyslexic so half of them dyslexic 80 percent of them struggle to read. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7274.08s)]
*  So so when we talk about when we talk about recidivism and we talk about preparing someone to be reintegrated back into society right. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7292.08s)]
*  The Department of Corrections has failed. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7302.08s)]
*  How can you say you're going to rehabilitate somebody reading for me right. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7305.08s)]
*  I believe that reading is a fundamental right. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7309.08s)]
*  My grandmother used to read to me when I was a kid. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7311.08s)]
*  I lay in her lap and she would read to me and it wasn't even about what she read to me but it was the connection that she and I had together and just being there with her and it made me respect the idea of what it means to read right. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7313.08s)]
*  But when we talk about like going going back to the PDF thing right. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7327.08s)]
*  A guy comes home and and and he's supposed to go online and fill out an application but he can't even read. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7331.08s)]
*  How is he supposed to follow basic instructions during transportation and trying to get onto the train and navigate through all of the basic necessities in life. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7339.08s)]
*  And he can't even read. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7353.08s)]
*  This this is even there's an even more startling picture to that right. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7355.08s)]
*  What about due process. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7360.08s)]
*  Right. A guy's in a courtroom and a lawyer is giving him paperwork and he can't even read. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7363.08s)]
*  So there's there's there's no system in place. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7372.08s)]
*  And I think that there's something that needs to be that needs to be addressed. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7376.08s)]
*  I want to get to what were the circumstances that got your sentence reduced and how did that come about. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7380.08s)]
*  OK. So I can't even count how many motions I filed throughout my incarceration for 40 10s with this emotion to vacate. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7386.08s)]
*  Ritter Eric Omnibus which is an appeal to a judge to the appellate division to overturn your appeal your right to appeal. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7398.08s)]
*  I filed a motion called the Domestic Violence Justice Survivors Act and I knew that the motion was going to get denied because I didn't qualify for the motion for the motion. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7411.08s)]
*  But my spirit told me to do it. My intuition told just valid and I filed it. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7425.08s)]
*  And in the process of filing that motion that's when I met Allison Hart and Barbara Zoloff at the Center for Appellate Litigation. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7432.08s)]
*  And they have what they call is the years program youth emergent assisted resentencing program. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7441.08s)]
*  And what they do is they look for individuals who meet a certain age bracket when they were sentenced a crime and then the sentencing that's attached usually disparaging sentences. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7448.08s)]
*  And so the motion got denied. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7462.08s)]
*  But in the process I connected with Allison and they reached out to me and they said hey listen. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7465.08s)]
*  We think you qualify for the program. We think you're the poster child for this program based on the circumstances. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7472.08s)]
*  And it that began the process of my release. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7481.08s)]
*  I think what paid what played a significant role was what I had done while I was in prison because that's one of the major things that the district attorney's office had looked at. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7486.08s)]
*  That's one of the major things that Josh and Allison and everybody had brought to the attention of these people say OK you know you have a guy who has these set of circumstances. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7497.08s)]
*  But look at what he has done while he was incarcerated. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7508.08s)]
*  Look what he has been able to accomplish. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7511.08s)]
*  And he did all of this under the pretenses that he was never going to get out. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7513.08s)]
*  So we were going back and forth. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7520.08s)]
*  We filed a bunch of paperwork. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7523.08s)]
*  We had to get a bunch of documents sent out a whole bunch of documents and they put together what they call is a mitigation packet and a mitigation package just outlines everything my circumstances my sentence my crime. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7525.08s)]
*  Accountability and a whole bunch of other factors. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7540.08s)]
*  And they submitted it. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7545.08s)]
*  It was a 440 20 in New York State which is a motion to resentence or motion to vacate the sentence. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7547.08s)]
*  And initially the ball was rolling. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7554.08s)]
*  The district attorney's office had initially conceded to the motion saying we're not going to oppose the motion. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7558.08s)]
*  And then something happened. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7567.08s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what happened but maybe Josh. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7570.08s)]
*  He has more of a background insight. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7573.08s)]
*  I have more of a background insight. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7577.08s)]
*  And at that time me and Bruce were working I didn't know Josh and Bruce said yo listen man I'm going to talk to my man Josh Dubey. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7580.08s)]
*  He knows some people that know some people and I didn't know that he was working with Derek Hamilton. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7589.08s)]
*  Derek Hamilton and I had worked in the law library together so I think when he mentioned to Derek he said you know my nickname was Superb. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7593.08s)]
*  That was that was my nickname in prison. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7600.08s)]
*  And he said you know a guy named Superb. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7605.08s)]
*  Yeah I know Superb. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7607.08s)]
*  So him and Derek got together along with Allison Harp and Barbara Zoloff and they went back to the district attorney's office in full force. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7608.08s)]
*  They had all kind of me guys. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7620.08s)]
*  You could probably know I mean I don't know you know the details more than I do. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7622.08s)]
*  Well I mean listen I don't want to get too much into the details because I don't think they matter. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7625.08s)]
*  I think they matter and I think I want to make sure that the credit is given where it belongs which is probably to Sheldon first before transforming his life and to Barbara and Allison because these are two amazing attorneys that saw potential and the injustice in what was done to Sheldon and who he had become and they got to know him. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7631.08s)]
*  You know and I'm on the phone with Bruce and these prison calls if they're not a legal call these prison calls are like sometimes they just end real abruptly. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7654.08s)]
*  You know it's like oh shit oh shit oh shit I got to go buy you know or oh they're giving me a hard time they're doing account now I got to go buy or sometimes it'll just click off. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7664.08s)]
*  So Bruce is you know about to get out. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7675.08s)]
*  He's got his clemency is granted. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7680.08s)]
*  He had he had gone to the parole board with a claim of innocence which is so rare and got granted the parole pending his the reinvestigation of his case. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7683.08s)]
*  But he has clemency with no strings attached other than being on probation until they make a final decision on his innocence and he's on the phone with me going yo yo you got a I got this guy Sheldon Johnson right here and he wants to talk to you. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7697.08s)]
*  He's his his lawyer knows your cousin and I was like what the fuck is this guy talking about and I was like Bruce man I got to worry about getting you out and this was going on for like a full month. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7717.08s)]
*  And you know he's right here he's right here wants to talk to you so I'm not talking to anyone else I'm dealing with your case I got to get you out. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7729.08s)]
*  He's like please talk to Alison she's been at your house before. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7737.08s)]
*  You know you got something you got your lines crossed somewhere. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7742.08s)]
*  So I finally like paid attention to it. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7747.08s)]
*  I had a million other cases going on and Bruce was our first client at the Perlmutter Center and we were like you know really lining things up for his release. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7752.08s)]
*  And I speak to Sheldon's lawyer and she said you know I'm actually friends with your cousin and when she organized the baby shower for your first for your daughter was my oldest Lila. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7761.08s)]
*  She said I was at your house for your baby shower I remember your wife Jillian real well. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7776.08s)]
*  She's like tells me I remember your house and I'm like this couple come on you can't make this shit up connections connection and now. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7781.08s)]
*  I mean in New York City it was just too wild. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7790.08s)]
*  So I said send me send me the mitigation submission and that was when I read about Sheldon and I went to Derek Hamilton who is a one man cyclone of justice. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7794.08s)]
*  You know he's been on the show he's just he is doing he just does so much for so many people he's like I know him he's an amazing guy we got it we're going to get him out. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7809.08s)]
*  So right in the middle of it's there's so many Trump things where there's cameras all outside that I forget. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7820.08s)]
*  I forget what it was. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7829.08s)]
*  Pushing it back they said oh it's too much going on. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7831.08s)]
*  What was it what was it though it was him being indicted or. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7833.08s)]
*  It was him being indicted and then they were saying that it was too much police activity there that they just kept trying they just kept pushing it back. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7837.08s)]
*  So what happened was there was like we we were at the district attorney's office on a different case that we're working on and we asked to speak to the district attorney of New York and let him know that we were now representing Sheldon along with the Center for Appellate Litigation. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7844.08s)]
*  And made a passionate plea on Sheldon's behalf and I don't want to go too much into the details but we were ended up you know kudos to the Manhattan district attorney's office for for actually you know paying attention and and seeing that Sheldon was worthy of a second chance and really the that the sentence did not fit the crime. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7861.08s)]
*  And the twist on Sheldon's story that I it's like a head scratcher to me that I asked him about was the judge that sentenced him as a black man. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7886.08s)]
*  And you know I said to Sheldon that did that ever strike you as I mean here's a African American judge that looks at this young young black kid and should understand his circumstances and have a better understanding of it and not want to throw away his life. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7899.08s)]
*  And I said so what do you do with that fact and Sheldon Sheldon said well I'll let you respond to it because he said something to me that I didn't really I mean this judge now you know sits as a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7923.08s)]
*  I don't know what to make of that I don't know I just seems so strange to me that that is who you know said this guy's not worthy of redemption. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7939.08s)]
*  One of the things that I expressed to Josh when we had this conversation was that just in my just in my experiences dealing with judges and prosecutors and correctional officers in particular who are black right. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7955.08s)]
*  They struggle with this idea that they feel that they have to be harder on their own people for one to make an example and so that their colleagues don't think that they're being weak or showing favoritism because oh this guy is black so you're showing him favoritism. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7974.08s)]
*  But the idea of like what Josh is saying like you would think that someone who's in this position as a judge he's an arbitrator right he is supposed to be someone who is in a position of power and authority should be able to look down. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=7993.08s)]
*  And I mean maybe maybe maybe he saw something I don't know what his experiences was I can't speak to that. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8010.08s)]
*  I think that you know maybe he saw me as as a menace you know but I do honestly believe that you know we need these people to be able to look at things from an objective right because when you when when as a person of color and in a position of power like a lot of times it's a subjective reality. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8020.08s)]
*  That's attached to personal feelings and experiences and a person who's in that position should be in a position to to be more objective right. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8048.08s)]
*  We talk about objectivity and I think that's what it boils down to you know subjectivity versus objectivity right. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8060.08s)]
*  I think what you're talking about too is expressed by I know a lot of guys that have been that have had dealings with black cops black guys having deals with black cops and they will tell you man they will go out of their way oftentimes to show that they're not showing any favoritism. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8068.08s)]
*  Like they have to show because their minority in their precinct and they they go out of way to show that they fit in with that culture. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8088.08s)]
*  Right so so so you know and you know Sean just to speak to what he said right like when I was in upstate New York or Auburn and Clinton and Attica you had a sprinkle of maybe one or two black cops and the black cops were always the worst. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8098.08s)]
*  Because like he just said you know they are minority and they don't want to be ostracized by their co-workers or made to seem as if they're showing favoritism towards the prisoners so they go out of their way to just be extra. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8118.08s)]
*  That's what we used to say he's just being extra. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8133.08s)]
*  He wants to enforce all of the rules with a white cop might say this guy got a pot and I so you know it in prison you know we have like you know you have pots guys cook and you have a high issues the like a coil that's detached from a hot pot and you use it to make food. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8136.08s)]
*  There's been times when you know you'll have a white cop that are coming to sell and it's contraband you're not supposed to have it you'll have a white cop that are coming to sell and you'll see a pot and he's just like he's just using that to cook. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8156.08s)]
*  Then you have a black cop that are coming to be like no he can't have that you know and it's and it's just it's just it's just it's just interesting. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8168.08s)]
*  And I think it goes and I think it goes back even farther than that right when you go back all the way into slavery you know you had the house nigga in the field niggas use my language for using those words right you could use them we can't right you know I'm saying and that the idea of the person the guy who was in the house. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8178.08s)]
*  He was harder on his own people his fellow slaves than some of the some of the overseers may have been all the slave masses so it's this this transferred psychological state where you know a person feels like they have to just go above and beyond to like like Joe just said to show that oh I'm not showing favoritism. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8198.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8221.08s)]
*  Well I'm not speaking you know this whole talking white. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8222.08s)]
*  God it's such a fucked up system. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8225.08s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8227.08s)]
*  It's so fucked up and every time we have one of these conversations I leave and I just drive and I think when I'm driving home just like what the fuck. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8228.08s)]
*  Like the just the sea of human beings that are entrapped in this system. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8237.08s)]
*  What is the number of incarcerated individuals in the United States right now. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8243.08s)]
*  Two million. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8246.08s)]
*  So that's more than the population of Austin actually 1.9 to rounded off as two. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8249.08s)]
*  Roughly Austin and the surrounding areas. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8257.08s)]
*  So interesting that all these people Austin right Texas Texas taxpayers pay 3.5 million dollars in taxes towards prisons. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8260.08s)]
*  3.5 million dollars. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8273.08s)]
*  How much of that could be saved if it's invest. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8274.08s)]
*  I mean it would be a fascinating study if one state would implement what we're talking about like community outreach programs starting at a grassroots level. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8277.08s)]
*  How much money would be saved by the state. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8289.08s)]
*  So investing that money. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8291.08s)]
*  So for example right on the 17th of this month we went to I told you we went to the rally treatment not jails right. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8292.08s)]
*  So the idea of the treatment not jails is to have a diversion court that deals with substance abuse and give the judges the discretion to send people who clearly have substance abuse issues into a program as opposed to incarceration. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8300.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8315.08s)]
*  And for every dollar that is spent in this program you save two dollars and twenty one cents. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8316.08s)]
*  I mean there are studies we could go through you know incarceration in the federal prisons and the state prisons and at the risk of sounding like stat machines. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8322.08s)]
*  You obviously see Sheldon is very well versed I am as well. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8334.08s)]
*  But the point is is the short answer is we would save a ton of money and be able to invest in people and things to make people happy not sad to engage in enjoyment not suffering. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8338.08s)]
*  So productivity not dependent. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8355.08s)]
*  Wouldn't it just take one governor to implement something like this that would show that there's a benefit financially for the state. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8358.08s)]
*  But look who they're beholden to you mentioned it earlier. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8366.08s)]
*  Then they have to worry about how will that impact my electability. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8369.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8373.08s)]
*  Because is the corrections officers union the police union are they going to get behind me in the next election. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8374.08s)]
*  You know it takes I think when you take a step back from a governor like we have a guy who is the D.A. Brooklyn his name is district attorney Gonzalez. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8380.08s)]
*  And you know we have an amazing relationship with him the Perlmutter Center Derek Hamilton especially where we're able to go to him and his and the people that work with him and say look we have a client right now that's in prison for I think 30 years on a 30 year sentence for a six dollar robbery. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8390.08s)]
*  And at a drug house and the diversion programs the drug diversion programs that are available now weren't available back then. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8410.08s)]
*  He's 69 years old. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8418.08s)]
*  So you know we're really hoping I think we're very close to the finish line of getting him released. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8421.08s)]
*  So you know I think that the short answer is yeah it would take a governor to implement a program to be able to point funds in the right direction. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8428.08s)]
*  And you talked about just one second you talked about HBC use FAMU in Florida. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8443.08s)]
*  The only land grant HBC you in the state is the disparity in funding of that school versus other schools in the state is is not a matter of you know it's a matter of fact. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8451.08s)]
*  I was recently arguing on behalf of these students that just want to be funded the same way Florida State University of Florida and all the other public universities are like two weeks before my argument on the state's motion to dismiss the United States government. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8471.08s)]
*  The United States Department of Education sent a letter to the governor in Florida and said here are the statistics. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8493.08s)]
*  Now this is all traceable to what they call de jure segregation. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8501.08s)]
*  There there was the you know and please fund the school appropriately. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8507.08s)]
*  Well the judge just dismissed the case a few days ago and I would invite people to go online and read the decision because we're going to appeal it to the 11th Circuit in Atlanta but it wasn't it wasn't a it's not a matter of of there's no controversy. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8512.08s)]
*  There's no argument that no we are funding it appropriately. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8531.08s)]
*  FAMU was founded on a slave plantation. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8536.08s)]
*  A former slave plantation. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8540.08s)]
*  And you know when I brought that up at the oral argument the judge won nuts on me. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8543.08s)]
*  What? No, you're saying it's a slave plant? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8548.08s)]
*  I'm saying that's where it started and if you take a thread and pull it forward through time the United States Office of Civil Rights in the 1970s in the 1990s went to the state of Florida and said you are not funding FAMU appropriately. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8550.08s)]
*  And they entered into these consent decrees with them where they had to do what's called destroy vestiges of de jure segregation because since Brown versus Board of Education there was another Supreme Court decision called Fortis which talked about how do you establish that a pattern or practice is traceable to segregation. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8568.08s)]
*  And the state of Florida just is ignored it. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8590.08s)]
*  So does Governor DeSantis have the ability to make sure that FAMU is funded appropriately? [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8594.08s)]
*  Or is Governor DeSantis going to worry more about Florida State University being somehow shortchanged in the national championship and earmark funds to challenge the college football folks to make sure I mean are you fucking kidding me? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8602.08s)]
*  I went to Florida State. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8624.08s)]
*  I think it's fucking it's lunacy. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8626.08s)]
*  So the answer to your question is yes but he's not going to do it for whatever political reasons he has. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8630.08s)]
*  Why not fund the school so that there is some you know a level playing field you know. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8638.08s)]
*  And it's a controversial subject amongst ignorant voters. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8645.08s)]
*  It's a controversial subject amongst ignorant voters because all all Governor DeSantis has to say is he took a page out of Trump's book because he knows it works is all he has to say is woke woke woke woke woke woke woke. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8649.08s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8664.08s)]
*  What does it mean? [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8666.08s)]
*  It means different things to different people. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8667.08s)]
*  All I'm saying is look at the statistics and you cannot come to any conclusion but that FAMU, the only HBCU that is a land grant institution in Florida meaning that they were granted land, is funded disproportionate to any other college in the state. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8669.08s)]
*  And there is no reason for it other than that it is a vestige of segregation. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8688.08s)]
*  And you know really the state has the burden to say no there is a justified reason for it under the law. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8694.08s)]
*  I'm just giving it to you in plain English. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8702.08s)]
*  They don't put anything forth. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8704.08s)]
*  I mean I had the judge asking me questions in the oral argument on the motion to dismiss questions like this. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8707.08s)]
*  Well well couldn't it be that Florida State University had better a better boosters club and that they were able to raise more money. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8714.08s)]
*  And I said you're absolutely right you're making my argument for me. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8724.08s)]
*  When you are struggling to make sure that the microscopes work in your science labs, which one of my clients will tell you is the case, and you have dilapidated buildings, are you worrying about starting a fundraising organization and boosters? [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8727.08s)]
*  Well couldn't they have gone and lobbied the legislator? [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8744.08s)]
*  Yeah they could have. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8747.08s)]
*  Who was running the legislator in Florida? [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8748.08s)]
*  You know and so when you start to run into arguments like that the writing sort of on the wall, and we have to now take it up with the you know the 11th Circuit in Atlanta and try to get that decision overturned. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8751.08s)]
*  This was on a motion to dismiss where the standard is just I have to take all of the facts that the plaintiffs are alleging as true and assume them to be true at this stage. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8764.08s)]
*  So it's you know the point is the problem would not exist if the governor just said you know what I just got these statistics from the Department of Education. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8776.08s)]
*  Let's just fund FAMU proportionate to how we fund every other school and they just don't and what they fall back on is well you know there's merit based funding. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8787.08s)]
*  I mean start peeling the layers of that so you look at the graduation rates, you look at other metrics. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8799.08s)]
*  Quantifiable. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8807.08s)]
*  Yeah I think you see the flaw there right. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8809.08s)]
*  So yeah it can get frustrating at times and what you know like what I have a choice now. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8811.08s)]
*  Do I fold up the tent? No you go to the Court of Appeals and you make your case and you just keep on fighting and trying to get it right. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8818.08s)]
*  So to piggyback off of what you just said right you know when you say can the governor do these things right. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8826.08s)]
*  Yes they can. A lot of times these objectives are long term and it takes time to quantify them. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8835.08s)]
*  So when we speak about quantifying like these examples of what are the circumstances surrounding the lacking of funding. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8844.08s)]
*  A lot of times these governors are more concerned about whether or not this is going to come out during election year and people are going to you know whether liberals or conservatives are going to go against them and vote against them because they supported education of incarcerated individuals. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8854.08s)]
*  I remember when I was going to Auburn and I was in the Cornell Prison Education Program this was in 2014. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8875.08s)]
*  You had correctional officers families outside the facility protesting as the volunteers were coming into prison with signs saying does my kid have to get convicted in order to get a free education. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8884.08s)]
*  The idea was that we were receiving a free education because we were incarcerated which is not the case. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8902.08s)]
*  The idea is that education has been proven to prevent recidivism. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8908.08s)]
*  Individuals who have been shown to acquire associate's degrees and bachelor's degrees are like 91, 92 percent less likely to return back to prison. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8915.08s)]
*  So this is quantifiable evidence of how you take money and you allocate it into one project so over the long run you can save money. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8927.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8939.08s)]
*  So it can be done. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8940.08s)]
*  The response to that is not stop prisoners from being educated. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8941.08s)]
*  It's like make it easier for everybody. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8945.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8947.08s)]
*  That's the response. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8948.08s)]
*  I think the easy answer though to your question of why I don't focus my attention on governors is am I leaving this in people like Bill Clinton's hands when he was the governor of Arkansas. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8950.08s)]
*  That fucking guy. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8963.08s)]
*  Am I leaving it in the hands of Andrew Cuomo. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8964.08s)]
*  That fucking guy. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8966.08s)]
*  That guy wouldn't answer a fucking letter. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8968.08s)]
*  Wouldn't return. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8972.08s)]
*  You know his clemency program was to not have a clemency program. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8973.08s)]
*  So he was too busy hugging people. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8978.08s)]
*  He was too busy rubbing shoulders. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8980.08s)]
*  Stealing fields. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8982.08s)]
*  Oh am I bad? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8987.08s)]
*  I ain't mean it. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8988.08s)]
*  I was just. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8989.08s)]
*  That's just your opinion. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8990.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8991.08s)]
*  So I think that the time energy and resources are better spent. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8992.08s)]
*  I think the private sector comes up with better solutions oftentimes at helping like watch how what are they called the virtuous cycle. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=8997.08s)]
*  The virtuous cycle works like this. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9007.08s)]
*  When I saw the work that Alison Haupt and Barbara Zoloff were doing at the Center for Appellate Litigation I said this is this is like you know God's work. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9009.08s)]
*  This is like beautiful stuff they're doing and they're on a shoestring budget. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9021.08s)]
*  So rather than be like you know the civil rights community can be interesting. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9025.08s)]
*  It brings out the best and the worst in people. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9031.08s)]
*  A lot of these civil rights organizations you know again you throw human beings into any endeavor together are going to fuck it up. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9034.08s)]
*  They like to argue and get like I mean egos and look what happened to me by coming on the show and some folks tried to censor me and I just wouldn't have it. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9040.08s)]
*  So I saw the work that they were doing and I said you know what do you do you need help. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9055.08s)]
*  And they said we need help. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9060.08s)]
*  We need we have to do these mitigation reports and we have to hire people like in Sheldon's case to assess him a clinical psychologist a social worker whatever it is. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9061.08s)]
*  And we don't have the money to get the reports done and there's just two of us. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9072.08s)]
*  So the Perlmutter Center is providing them with the money to do those reports. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9077.08s)]
*  Steve Zeidman at CUNY is like he's this guy that I think that he's responsible single handedly for over 50 clemencies in the state of New York. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9083.08s)]
*  Amazing phenomenal guy. He's coming actually he's coming to Queens Defenders to do we're getting ready to start a clemency initiative at Queens Defenders. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9094.08s)]
*  He's coming to train a bunch of guys. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9101.08s)]
*  He's just this guy. Yeah he's that doesn't surprise me. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9103.08s)]
*  He's a guy that just he's a letter writing machine and he keeps the pressure on and he just doesn't give up on people. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9106.08s)]
*  And you know he needs help and we're looking for ways to collaborate. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9113.08s)]
*  So we said what what is it that moves the needle to these clemency units at governor's offices because the governor is not paying attention. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9118.08s)]
*  They have a battery of people that listen to these cases and what they do are videos. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9126.08s)]
*  He does these really great videos that are like a day in the life and to show and to sort of humanize the client so they're not just on paper and pictures and they go and interview them and have them talk about what it would mean to be free and how they've changed themselves. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9132.08s)]
*  So he needed a little bit of help to get these videos produced. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9149.08s)]
*  So we've agreed to donate some funds there. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9153.08s)]
*  And I think it just like having this this more synergistic approach rather than have it be about me or put my name on the door. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9156.08s)]
*  Let me get the credit. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9167.08s)]
*  You know we just all pitch in. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9168.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9170.08s)]
*  To wrap this up. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9171.08s)]
*  If someone's listening to this and they want to reach out they want to help they want to contribute. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9172.08s)]
*  But maybe somebody does want to some Jeff Bezos type character does want to get involved and see if there is something they could do in terms of like some sort of a community outreach center or something that can help. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9177.08s)]
*  What can they do? [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9188.08s)]
*  Who can they reach out to? [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9189.08s)]
*  They can go to the Perlmutter Center for Legal Justice at Cardozo Law. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9190.08s)]
*  It's it's like Sheldon can Google. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9195.08s)]
*  Anyone can Google it. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9198.08s)]
*  There it is right there. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9200.08s)]
*  Yeah there it is. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9201.08s)]
*  And I think Googling it would be faster if you scroll down to the bottom of it you'll find the donate button. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9203.08s)]
*  You know there are ways and there's some of my students. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9211.08s)]
*  There's a give now button. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9215.08s)]
*  We put it all the way to the bottom. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9217.08s)]

*  And you know we're we're on the precipice of a major announcement with one of the most prestigious law firms in the country in a couple of weeks that has agreed to not donate just financial resources but woman and manpower to help litigate these [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9233.08s)]
*  cases. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9QVqtasEhk&t=9251.08s)]
