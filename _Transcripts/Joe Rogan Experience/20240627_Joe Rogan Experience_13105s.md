# Joe Rogan Experience #1903 - Kurt Metzger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5.72s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=13.92s)]
*  Boy, you're going deep, fella. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=14.92s)]
*  I mean, that's why Elon Musk is a success. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=17.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=20.44s)]
*  Because he smoked weed on this show. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=21.44s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=22.44s)]
*  That's like when high school kids do it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=23.44s)]
*  That guy's got a lot of money and I saw him smoke weed on this show. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  That's what happened, bro. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=30.84s)]
*  That was the root of it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=31.84s)]
*  I almost got him fucking like removed from NASA top clearance. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=33.64s)]
*  That's crazy, dude, that you would have to. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=39.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're drinking whiskey for like two hours before we hit that bunt. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=41.64s)]
*  That's wild how slow that aspect, because weed's so legal in so many places you forget [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=47.56s)]
*  that it's not legal still. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=52.2s)]
*  Well, it was legal in California. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=53.56s)]
*  That's what he asked me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=55.5s)]
*  He goes, it is legal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=56.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's legal here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=57.5s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=58.5s)]
*  There's California law and then there's state law. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=59.5s)]
*  Federal law, rather. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=63.78s)]
*  Or also like corporate investor confidence law, I guess, is what he's violating. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=64.78s)]
*  NASA had an issue with it, so it's government. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=69.66s)]
*  Marijuana, still very unfortunately, is still federally schedule one, which means it has [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=73.06s)]
*  no medical benefits, which is hilarious because I'm pretty sure cocaine is schedule two because [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=78.62s)]
*  cocaine has medical benefits. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=84.94s)]
*  Throat, right? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=86.9s)]
*  Like Elvis would get it for his throat. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=87.9s)]
*  Is that what he was saying? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=89.54s)]
*  I mean, officially, that's why they would give it to him. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=91.54s)]
*  I was watching like his entourage, like the guys from his entourage. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=94.3s)]
*  We need to get Elvis some cocaine for his throat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=96.86s)]
*  It was like this medical grade, the kind Robert Evans got busted trying to get the pure liquid [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=99.78s)]
*  cocaine and they would just dip these cotton swabs in and you stick them and they would [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=105.18s)]
*  just sit there and be ripped for hours, he said on liquid. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=108.9s)]
*  It was for his throat. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, it would numb it because they had like I had lidocaine on my nose, which is like [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=112.74s)]
*  a cousin of cocaine, I guess. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=119.1s)]
*  And one of the things that I thought was really interesting about it fucking killed my appetite. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=120.94s)]
*  Like I tried to go to dinner afterwards and was like, God, I don't want to eat anything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=124.58s)]
*  I know I'm hungry. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=128.62s)]
*  I had this delicious steak in front of me and I couldn't eat it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=129.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=132.46s)]
*  Because the lidocaine, like it was still in my throat. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=133.46s)]
*  I could taste it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=135.3s)]
*  It was like, whoa. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=136.3s)]
*  Is that like a similar? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=137.3s)]
*  It's not moving. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=139.3s)]
*  It numbs everything. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=140.3s)]
*  It doesn't get you high, but it does get you feeling weird. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=142.06s)]
*  You don't feel like you're not in any way like high, you know, but you're like, like [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  weirded out. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  I think he gave me like a heavy dose too because he had to clean out my nose and how did he [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=151.73999999999998s)]
*  apply my septum? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=155.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=158.34s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=159.34s)]
*  I don't remember because they put me under. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=160.34s)]
*  I don't remember if it was injections. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't remember what happened because I had to go out for that because it's pretty serious. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=164.34s)]
*  Fucking get in there and shave down your turbinates. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=169.7s)]
*  Oh, I didn't even know this was called. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=173.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's like these bumps in the middle. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=175.46s)]
*  My nose is fucked. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=177.1s)]
*  From getting hit or just? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=178.1s)]
*  Oh, well, from everything. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=179.82s)]
*  I fell down a flight of stairs when I was five years old. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=181.06s)]
*  So I remember, yeah, there's a little photo of me with a black eye when I was five. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=183.02s)]
*  I remember I just slipped and fell down a cement flight of stairs in my backyard when [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=186.02s)]
*  I was five. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=190.9s)]
*  Smashed my nose. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=191.9s)]
*  And so I think from then on, I never had a good nose. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=192.9s)]
*  I think it was pretty fucked up from then on. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=197.10000000000002s)]
*  I was a literal mouth breather until I was 40. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=199.94s)]
*  And then I got my nose fixed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=204.3s)]
*  Oh my God, it was the greatest thing ever. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=205.3s)]
*  I just had always had huge nostril capacity myself. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=207.74s)]
*  Well, a lot of guys start out with huge nostril capacity. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=211.06s)]
*  But if you get hit there enough, a lot of wrestlers and very much boxers, boxers, they [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=214.3s)]
*  get their nose smashed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=221.02s)]
*  MMA fighters get their nose smashed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=222.02s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=223.86s)]
*  And people have stuffed up noses. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=225.42000000000002s)]
*  Remember Randall Texkov? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=227.42000000000002s)]
*  He looked like somebody just spread his nose like butter onto his. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=228.42000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, Artie Lang probably has the most impressive broken nose I've ever seen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=231.82000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=235.86s)]
*  Artie's is collapsed, you know? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=236.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's a crazy story. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=238.70000000000002s)]
*  I just talked to him not that long ago. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=241.9s)]
*  I love that dude so much. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=242.9s)]
*  I love him so much. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=243.9s)]
*  He's such a good, he's like when you're around him, you just want to hug him. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=245.94000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=248.86s)]
*  He's just such a good, he's always been that way too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=249.86s)]
*  I've known that guy for 20 plus years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=251.74s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the, if you, we used to do me and Sherrod's old podcast, Raze Wars, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=254.66s)]
*  and he'd give me a ride back to Washington Heights and it was like the funniest, it's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=259.06s)]
*  like the funniest dude to hang out with that I ever met. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=262.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=265.62s)]
*  His fucking stories, they're so good. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=266.62s)]
*  And even when he sobered up, they were just as good if not better. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=267.62s)]
*  Like I did his, I did a podcast with him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  We used the Skank Studio. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=273.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=275.3s)]
*  Legion of Skank Studio. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=276.3s)]
*  Thanks to them for that because it was pretty awesome of them to let me borrow their studio. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=277.3s)]
*  So we did Artie in there and Artie was like stone cold sober for like over a year, like [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=281.58s)]
*  confident that he's going to keep it together. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  He had a guy with him helping him. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  He was on the ball, on the ball. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=291.3s)]
*  His fucking stories were sharper than ever. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=293.06s)]
*  Sharper than ever. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  It's like you would think, sometimes you think like if a guy sobers up, because some guys [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=297.53999999999996s)]
*  do, they sober up and then they get boring. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=300.82s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=303.06s)]
*  You know, something happens, they lose that wildness. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=304.06s)]
*  No, he doesn't. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=306.58s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=307.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=308.58s)]
*  It brings it down to a manageable... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=309.58s)]
*  You know who else got really better after they got sober is Attel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=311.26s)]
*  Attel was always amazing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=314.02s)]
*  He was always a great, great comic, but being healthier because like he has more energy. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=316.02s)]
*  He just stopped. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=320.98s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=321.98s)]
*  Just stopped. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=322.98s)]
*  When he stopped drinking, like really? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=323.98s)]
*  That was like a whole... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=324.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=325.98s)]
*  I think he, you know, you get captured by a thing that you're known for too. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=326.98s)]
*  Because remember Insomniac? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=330.38s)]
*  He would get hammered in every town. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=331.38s)]
*  It was a fucking great show. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=333.02s)]
*  He told me it was like impossible to do without people throwing like ice cubes at the production. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=334.02s)]

*  But Jake called me and told me what the clip is. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=478.74s)]
*  I guess a producer, a producer from Tucker Carlson, because Chappelle was on SNL. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=482.14s)]
*  I don't know why, but she's at Gas Digital. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=489.5s)]
*  So Dave Smith, you have Dave Smith on. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=491.97999999999996s)]

*  He knows his shit. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=499.97999999999996s)]
*  And Lewis kept recommending him to her. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=500.97999999999996s)]
*  And she goes, oh, you have his number? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=503.78s)]
*  He goes, yeah, he'd love to do it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=505.06s)]
*  She starts texting Dave Smith. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=508.06s)]
*  It's such an honor. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=509.94s)]

*  So they figure out she thinks he's Dave Chappelle for some reason. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=516.46s)]
*  How? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=519.66s)]
*  Well, that was a lot of the mystery was like how you would mix that up. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=520.66s)]
*  It turned out Lewis had said something that literally, like they went back and Lewis realized [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  from texting. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=529.5s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=530.5s)]
*  So he just flubbed a text? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=531.5s)]
*  He told her like Dave is the closest thing I have to a brother about Dave Smith, but [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=532.5s)]
*  she thinks he's Chappelle. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=536.78s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=537.78s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=538.78s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=539.9s)]
*  Because Dave is like one of those guys like Eddie. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=540.9s)]
*  You could say Eddie. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=543.1s)]
*  Everybody knows you're saying Eddie Murphy. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=544.1s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=545.5s)]

*  Like I say it all the time. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=547.5s)]
*  I say Dave. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=548.86s)]
*  I don't even have to bother saying Dave Chappelle. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=549.86s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=552.02s)]
*  Well, around Gas Digital, Dave Smith's you say Dave, probably gonna be Dave Smith. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=553.02s)]
*  But it's something Lewis went and checked his text and that's how he realized it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=557.3s)]
*  OK, so then they get Soder. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=562.06s)]
*  They call Soder to call her up as Chappelle. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=564.74s)]
*  So it's on mute for the podcast. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=567.26s)]
*  And I think his whole thing is he's going to use the name Lewis J. Gómez in every sentence [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=569.98s)]
*  that he says to her. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=574.62s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=576.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=577.34s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=578.34s)]
*  Dave Smith, by the way, is one of the most knowledgeable political guys I've ever talked [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=579.34s)]
*  to. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=583.54s)]

*  It's better if I'm in the studio, too. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=602.26s)]
*  If I was doing it remote, it's not as good. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=604.46s)]

*  Now I didn't get tricked by ... [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=652.7s)]
*  How did you get hooked on it? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=653.7s)]
*  I knew it was heroin when I did it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=654.98s)]
*  So you did it for fun? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=657.1s)]
*  I had a legit prescription at one point from Hurt My Back and then ... [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=658.86s)]
*  Oh, the old Hurt My Back. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=662.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I had a Percocet, which still has, I guess, the Tylenol in it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=664.74s)]
*  And then they were just around. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=670.0600000000001s)]
*  I could get my hands on them, the blue ones. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=672.38s)]
*  Oh. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=674.38s)]
*  So I started taking those. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=675.38s)]
*  I was one of the people that they said, it's not addictive to. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=676.42s)]
*  You knew? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=679.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=680.14s)]
*  By that time, everybody knew it was drugs. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=681.14s)]
*  So I don't blame it on the Sackler family tricked me. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=682.14s)]
*  But they did ... remember breakthrough pain? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=685.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=688.34s)]
*  So I guess that's ... you have a tolerance to heroin and you ... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=689.34s)]
*  It's called breakthrough pain. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=692.82s)]
*  Yeah, they call it ... ooh, the pain somehow broke through. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=694.58s)]
*  You just need a higher and higher dose. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=696.98s)]
*  Yeah, that breakthrough term is a marketing term. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=698.9s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=701.42s)]
*  That's what a breakthrough infection is. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=702.42s)]
*  That's not a medical ... that's a marketing thing. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=704.58s)]
*  They tricked America into getting hooked on heroin. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=707.2199999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=710.2199999999999s)]
*  When we were kids, okay, like in high school, for example, when you heard about a rock star [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=712.2199999999999s)]
*  who did heroin, when I heard about ... I guess it was a little after high school, but Kurt [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=717.9s)]
*  Cobain. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=723.02s)]
*  I was like, God, he's doing heroin? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=724.02s)]
*  Doesn't he know? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=725.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=726.02s)]
*  Doesn't he know? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=727.02s)]
*  That was in my high school. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=728.02s)]
*  I remember thinking that because I didn't do anything. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=729.5799999999999s)]
*  I was just a double witness. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=731.66s)]
*  I didn't drink or do ... you know. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=732.66s)]
*  What was the numbers back then of people who actually did heroin versus now? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=734.34s)]
*  I found out later, later, years later, I found out a whole bunch of people were on heroin [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=737.78s)]
*  in my high school because Tom's River ... remember the pizza connection and all that shit? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=740.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=745.38s)]
*  Really pure heroin was coming in through Tom's River. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=746.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=749.1800000000001s)]
*  High school north was the more ... heroin high was the nickname of it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=750.1800000000001s)]
*  That was a little bit richer kids and that was way more of a thing there, but it was [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=753.58s)]
*  at my school too. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=757.26s)]
*  I was very innocent when it came to drugs because most of my high school years I spent [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=758.26s)]
*  doing martial arts. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=762.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=763.98s)]
*  I really didn't party at all, but my boxing coach when I was 20 was this guy who was a [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=764.98s)]
*  longshoreman. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=770.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, crack? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  He smoked crack? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=773.3000000000001s)]
*  He didn't do anything. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=774.3000000000001s)]
*  He drank a little bit, but big Irish guy. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=775.3000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=777.3000000000001s)]
*  He great fucking guy, but he worked with a guy that was a heroin addict. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  I go, he's a heroin addict and he still has a job. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=782.86s)]
*  He goes, yep. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=784.86s)]
*  He goes every day at lunchtime. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=785.86s)]
*  He goes to this guy, he gets his bag, he sits in his car, he shoots it up, he sits in his [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=788.26s)]
*  car for an hour, and then he goes back to work. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=795.26s)]
*  I go, no fucking way. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=798.3s)]
*  He goes, yeah, and he's fine. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=799.3s)]
*  He goes, but he needs it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=801.7s)]
*  He's got to get it every day, but if he gets it every day, he's very functional. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=802.86s)]
*  I'm like, that's nuts. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=805.74s)]
*  I'm like, how many guys are like that? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=806.74s)]
*  He knew a bunch of people who did heroin. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=808.5s)]
*  I was like, you know a bunch of people that do heroin? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=811.38s)]
*  Who the fuck's doing heroin? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=814.02s)]
*  Whereas now, if you hear, oh, my uncle's on pills, like, ah, fuck another one. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=817.2199999999999s)]
*  It's another one. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=821.8599999999999s)]
*  It's another one. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=822.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, how many of our friends? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=823.8599999999999s)]
*  Taking the needle out of it really takes some stigma away, I guess, and also having it prescribed [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=824.8599999999999s)]
*  by a medical doctor. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=829.5799999999999s)]
*  Shaub had it and people had to take it from him. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=831.4599999999999s)]
*  His friends had to take it from him. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=833.9399999999999s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=835.38s)]
*  Before I knew him well. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=836.38s)]
*  He got hooked on pills. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=837.54s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=839.14s)]
*  He had an oxy problem. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=840.14s)]
*  He got his nose shattered in one of his big fights. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=841.14s)]
*  I think it was Mirko Krokop, hit him with an elbow in the nose. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=844.4599999999999s)]
*  This guy from Croatia is one of the most murderous kickboxes of all time. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=848.62s)]
*  Shaub actually knocked him out. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=851.8199999999999s)]
*  It was like Shaub's biggest win as a professional. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=853.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, he got elbowed in the process of doing that. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=856.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he got his nose shattered in the process. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=857.9399999999999s)]
*  So he got his nose fixed. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=859.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was that fight. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=861.14s)]
*  He got his nose fixed and then in getting his nose fixed, they got him hooked on the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=862.62s)]
*  pills. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=866.78s)]
*  Yum. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=867.78s)]
*  And he was just taking them. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=868.78s)]
*  Like, months after the surgery, he's still taking them. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=869.78s)]
*  And then his buddies pulled him aside. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=871.78s)]
*  You get tolerance pretty quick. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=873.18s)]
*  But it's also when you're not supposed to just get off, right? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=874.78s)]
*  You're supposed to wean yourself off that shit, right? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=877.86s)]
*  Well, you won't. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=879.78s)]
*  It's not like... [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=880.78s)]
*  Actually, Benzos, you could die. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=881.78s)]
*  Benzos, you could die. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=883.78s)]
*  Opiates, you think you're going to die, but you're not. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=884.78s)]
*  Should you wean yourself off? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  Do they like if they medically do it? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=889.54s)]
*  Like if you went check yourself into a rehab and said, hey, I have an oxycontin addiction. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=891.34s)]
*  Well, I didn't have to do that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=894.9s)]
*  They prescribed me Suboxone to quit it. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=896.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=898.5799999999999s)]
*  What I'm saying is like if you went like straight, like you were fucked up and you went straight [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=899.74s)]
*  to a rehab center. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=904.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=905.46s)]
*  Like would they wean you off of it or would they give you Suboxone? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=906.46s)]
*  They give you Suboxone. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=909.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=910.26s)]
*  And what is that? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=911.26s)]
*  That stuff? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=912.26s)]
*  I've heard people talk about that. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=913.26s)]
*  It's like a film. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=914.26s)]
*  It's a little orange film. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=915.26s)]
*  And it... [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=916.26s)]

*  Oh, what's his name? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=918.26s)]
*  I'm blanking on his name. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=919.26s)]

*  You're friends with him. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=925.26s)]

*  That's what that is. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=937.58s)]
*  Is it indica? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=938.58s)]
*  That's real shit. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=939.58s)]
*  No. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=940.58s)]
*  Go. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=941.58s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=942.58s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=943.58s)]
*  I only liked productivity weed. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=944.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=945.58s)]
*  I don't know if that's real, by the way. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=946.58s)]
*  Ari told me a story about him where he was somewhere and he was taken. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=947.58s)]
*  He took some Suboxone after he had done, you know, oxy or something and he got real [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=949.26s)]
*  sick and didn't know what... [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=954.3000000000001s)]
*  So the stuff knocks it out of your system immediately, with a Nail Oxen or something [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=956.06s)]
*  when you take it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=959.9399999999999s)]
*  So you're supposed to be in withdrawal before you take it. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=960.9399999999999s)]
*  So you have to wait until you're sick. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=963.26s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=965.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, when you feel sick and then you can take it because if you don't wait and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=966.3399999999999s)]
*  you still have that stuff in your system, it kicks you into withdrawal immediately. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=970.38s)]
*  Now, is there a concern with people getting on Suboxone? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=974.5s)]
*  Because I remember methadone. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=977.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=979.4599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  When we were... [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=981.4599999999999s)]
*  They'll keep you on it forever, by the way, if you want. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=982.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=984.18s)]
*  I remember the thing when we were playing pool back in the 90s that my friend Johnny [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=985.3s)]
*  B used to call these people the methadoneans. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=989.8199999999999s)]
*  They would come in from the methadone clinic. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=992.2199999999999s)]
*  So there would be like a methadone place that was right down the street and they would go [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=996.66s)]
*  to this methadone place, they'd get their fix, then they'd walk over and come to the [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1000.4599999999999s)]
*  pool hall and they'd just be like slack-jawed, knocking balls around. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1004.02s)]
*  And Johnny called them the methadoneans. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1007.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1009.5799999999999s)]
*  It was so weird. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1010.5799999999999s)]
*  And then they figured out at one point to take Xanax with it and it almost feels like [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1011.74s)]
*  heroin apparently. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1016.0200000000001s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1017.0200000000001s)]
*  Together? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1018.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1019.0200000000001s)]
*  There's an HBO documentary about it. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1020.0200000000001s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1021.0200000000001s)]
*  Like a few years back. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1022.0200000000001s)]
*  But they said that methadone is terrible for you. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1023.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that stuff's probably even more... [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1025.14s)]
*  It's probably worse than heroin. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1027.5s)]
*  Is methadone bad for you? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1029.22s)]
*  Withdrawal from methadone is worse? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1031.78s)]
*  The withdrawal from Suboxone felt worse than the withdrawal from the oxy. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1032.94s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1038.22s)]
*  If I had just called Turkey that, that would have been a less horrible withdrawal. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1039.3s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1042.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1043.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1044.78s)]
*  How long were you taking Suboxone for? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1045.78s)]
*  I don't know, like maybe almost a year. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1046.78s)]
*  Maybe not even, but I was down... [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1051.5s)]
*  I was weaned down to the tiniest bit of it because I was really like... [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1053.38s)]
*  And even the tiniest bit when you got off it completely, you had horrible withdrawals. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1056.02s)]
*  It sucked, dude. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1059.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1060.02s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1061.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1062.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1063.02s)]
*  So you tapered. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1064.02s)]
*  Yeah, I tapered. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1065.02s)]
*  I didn't like... [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1066.02s)]
*  Now, is that similar to methadone? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1067.02s)]
*  Is methadone supposed to be really bad when you try to get off of it too? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1068.1s)]
*  I've never taken methadone. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1069.66s)]
*  I don't know what it's like, but from what I get now, it's mostly Suboxone. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1070.66s)]
*  I don't know if anybody's still taking methadone. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1074.82s)]
*  I'm very ignorant to methadone. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1076.5s)]
*  What exactly is methadone? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1078.34s)]
*  I just know what it is with the thing they used to give you before they had Suboxone. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1081.26s)]
*  They give people when they were hooked on heroin. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1084.22s)]
*  I forgot, Suboxone probably blocks you. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1086.3s)]
*  I think methadone is supposed to do that too, but it blocks you from being able to get high [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1088.22s)]
*  if you relapse. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1090.78s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1091.78s)]
*  There's no reason to take more like... [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1092.78s)]
*  Unless you just get off that fucking Suboxone. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1094.34s)]
*  People get high off Suboxone too, but I didn't get any high off of that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1096.8999999999999s)]
*  I just didn't feel like sick when I was using it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1100.4599999999998s)]
*  We had a guy on a long time ago that was... [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1102.6599999999999s)]
*  He worked in a rehab center and he said a lot of it was a scam. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1104.9399999999998s)]
*  And he said they would get you hooked on their stuff and their stuff was Suboxone. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1107.9799999999998s)]
*  It does start to feel like that. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1112.02s)]
*  If they have you hooked on it and you're not getting high, what is it doing? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1114.78s)]
*  Keeping you... [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1119.54s)]
*  Well, for heroin? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1120.54s)]
*  See, you're not getting high on heroin anymore and Suboxone doesn't make you high. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1121.54s)]
*  So you have to take it to function to get off... [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1125.46s)]
*  That guy you're talking about that goes on his lunch break? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1127.6200000000001s)]
*  That sounds like he was doing just what he needed to feel normal. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1129.78s)]
*  But is this the case with everybody? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1132.7s)]
*  Because that sounds insane to me that you would have to be on something for a full year [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1134.22s)]
*  to get over something that... [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1138.42s)]
*  What would it normally be? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1139.7s)]
*  If you were on those Oxy's and you quit cold turkey and had horrible withdrawals, how long [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1141.42s)]
*  would you feel like shit for? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1147.02s)]
*  Well... [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1148.9s)]
*  A week? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1149.9s)]
*  A month? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1150.9s)]
*  Okay, so that's probably a week or less just the shitty feeling, but then you're not going [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1151.98s)]
*  to be right for a couple of months. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1155.74s)]
*  A couple of months? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1157.3400000000001s)]
*  That's what I've experienced. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1158.3400000000001s)]
*  What was that like when you say weren't right? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1160.3400000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1162.74s)]
*  Just like an off... [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1164.98s)]
*  You're burning out, whatever that... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1166.7s)]
*  I don't know what that receptor is, but... [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1168.5s)]
*  The good one? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1170.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1171.0600000000002s)]
*  The one that makes the heroin. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1172.0600000000002s)]
*  I beat on it quite a bit. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1173.0600000000002s)]
*  So it probably... [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1174.8600000000001s)]
*  Benzos is worse, dude. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1176.7800000000002s)]
*  I think that's the one that... [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1177.7800000000002s)]
*  That's the one that can kill you. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1178.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, not just that, but I think it affects... [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1179.94s)]
*  People I know that came off that, it affected them for a crazy amount of time. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1182.26s)]
*  For you, it was like cognitive decline, dull feeling... [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1185.82s)]
*  No energy. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1188.74s)]
*  No energy. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1189.74s)]
*  No energy. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1190.74s)]
*  But I wasn't really exercising a lot at that point, so that's a lot. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1191.74s)]
*  I didn't even realize how much... [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1196.54s)]
*  Just if you go exercise, the energy... [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1198.62s)]
*  I didn't realize how much... [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1200.54s)]
*  Dude, I say it all the time. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1201.54s)]
*  Nobody wants to listen because I'm a meathead. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1202.54s)]
*  It's a real problem. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1203.54s)]
*  No, there's a deep anger towards the very idea. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1204.54s)]
*  Yeah, there's a deep resistance towards exercise. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1209.5s)]
*  I remember feeling... [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1212.0200000000002s)]
*  Not like I'm mad at somebody that does workout, but I remember feeling like... [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1213.3000000000002s)]
*  I don't remember why, but I remember having that kind of feeling of like... [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1216.3400000000001s)]

*  It's hard to do. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1220.6200000000001s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1221.74s)]
*  When you see something... [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1222.74s)]
*  When someone does something that's hard to do... [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1223.74s)]
*  Also, it's connected to negative things, jocks, douchey male behavior, which I've been guilty [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1225.42s)]
*  of, but that's not all it is. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1230.9s)]
*  I think just non-meathead exercise, like yoga, is fantastic for you. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1236.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1239.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, just for mood stabilizer. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1240.6999999999998s)]
*  I didn't realize... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1241.6999999999998s)]
*  Because the other thing is, especially the whole time I live in New York, I don't think [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1242.6999999999998s)]
*  I was getting sun... [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1246.1s)]
*  I think I probably have vitamin D deficiency in a big way. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1247.1s)]
*  Oh, you 100% do. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1250.6599999999999s)]
*  100%. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1252.6599999999999s)]
*  If you're not supplementing with vitamin D and you live in the Northeast, and it's the [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1253.6599999999999s)]
*  winter time, you have vitamin D deficiency. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1257.6599999999999s)]
*  For food? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1259.78s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1261.7s)]
*  I think you can get vitamin D from some plants, like small amounts of it from some plants, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1263.3799999999999s)]
*  but I think primarily you get it from being in the sun, unless you're supplementing. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1268.7s)]
*  That's what I did first before I was in the sun first, and it felt like I got... [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1272.5s)]
*  Oh, it's the best. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1278.1s)]
*  That's the best way, too. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1279.58s)]
*  By far, the superior way to get vitamin D. Supplementing is just a safety measure, but [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1281.1399999999999s)]
*  you should supplement vitamin D. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1288.74s)]
*  It's really important. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1290.42s)]
*  It's so important for your immune system. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1291.66s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1293.46s)]
*  According to Ron and Patrick and a lot of other people that know a lot more than I do [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1294.46s)]
*  about it, they say it's not even really a vitamin, it's a hormone. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1297.66s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder why you can get it from the sun. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1300.86s)]
*  It's a vitamin. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1304.86s)]
*  It's pretty crazy, but it is a vitamin that you could take it in supplemental form, but [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1306.34s)]
*  it's so beneficial for your immune system. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1312.62s)]
*  At one point in time when they were linking COVID deaths with vitamin D deficiency... [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1314.54s)]
*  It's a times higher survival rate if you had vitamin D levels that were, did you see that? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1320.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's really high. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1323.4599999999998s)]
*  And then the number of people that were in the ICU, the number of them, it was very high [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1324.9399999999998s)]
*  that were deficient in vitamin D. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1329.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1331.86s)]
*  It's just good for your immune system, and it's a mood stabilizer, too, for those poor [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1332.86s)]
*  people that live in Seattle. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1336.4599999999998s)]
*  They need that something to fucking juice their mood up. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1338.54s)]
*  That's the thing that, the most I didn't realize how... [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1341.78s)]
*  Exercise. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1344.9799999999998s)]
*  How much it would even out of move. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1345.9799999999998s)]
*  It's a game changer. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1349.02s)]
*  It's a game changer. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1350.02s)]
*  The reason I had OxyContin in the first place was I hurt my back when I was working out. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1351.02s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1355.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1356.58s)]
*  So it's not like I didn't know. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1357.58s)]
*  I just hadn't done it for a long... [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1358.58s)]
*  The whole pandemic, I didn't do nothing. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1360.78s)]
*  When you just sit around doing nothing, you feel like shit. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1363.06s)]
*  It's just normal. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1365.22s)]
*  You've got to stir crazy. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1366.22s)]
*  It's like oil that's at the bottom of your engine tray, just sitting there. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1367.22s)]
*  It's not getting cranked over. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1371.26s)]
*  It's not getting used. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1372.54s)]
*  You just fucking feel gross, and your body doesn't know what to do. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1374.06s)]
*  Your body's like, why aren't we doing anything? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1377.02s)]
*  You have requirements. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1378.98s)]
*  Your body wants to do things. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1379.98s)]
*  The problem is it sucks. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1381.82s)]
*  You're lazy. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1382.82s)]
*  You get up in the morning. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1383.82s)]
*  I get it. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1384.82s)]
*  I get it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1385.82s)]
*  I fucking 100% get it. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1386.82s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1388.14s)]
*  It's like people think that people who do work out don't feel the exact same way they feel [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1389.14s)]
*  before they work out, because they kind of do. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1393.94s)]
*  There's most of the time when I work out, I don't want to work out. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1396.7s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1399.22s)]
*  Just make myself. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1400.22s)]
*  I get compulsive, so then I'm... [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1401.22s)]
*  How it would be if I get drug or something. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1404.82s)]
*  Oh, so you're just looking forward to it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1406.3s)]
*  That's how I hurt myself, because I've got to be like... [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1408.54s)]
*  I'm not dumb now how I do it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1410.42s)]
*  I don't do any stupid shit that's going to injure me, because I'm not going for glory [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1411.94s)]
*  or something. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1416.66s)]
*  But I would injure myself, because I would try to go too much. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1417.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1421.22s)]
*  That same addictive personality applies to your exercise, too. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1422.5s)]
*  You get obsessive. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1425.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1426.22s)]
*  Then, you know... [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1427.22s)]
*  A few days go by, I didn't do anything. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1428.22s)]
*  I start to feel an urge that I have to... [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1432.5s)]
*  I feel like... [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1435.78s)]
*  Yeah, I get those, too. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1437.02s)]
*  There's probably a lot of mood being held... [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1438.02s)]
*  One of my moods are probably being held together by that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1439.02s)]
*  Well, I think that's most people. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1441.22s)]
*  I think that's the way the human body functions that it's most efficient, is when it's in [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1443.7s)]
*  a fit condition. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1448.86s)]
*  I think the mind works better, the hormones work better, the mood works better, the cognitive [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1450.74s)]
*  function works better, all of it works better. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1455.62s)]
*  The problem is it's just connected to so much douchery, and then it's also hard to do. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1458.42s)]
*  There really is an eternal high school... [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1463.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1466.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, not just with that, with everything. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1467.3799999999999s)]
*  I've never seen it more than now, too, by the way, of a petty... [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1471.6599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't matter what anybody's saying, it's like, what lunch table do they sit at? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1476.6599999999999s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1479.86s)]
*  Do you want to be at the right table or not? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1480.86s)]
*  Well, fucking gyms are weird with that, too, right? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1483.54s)]
*  There's always flexy dudes. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1486.3s)]
*  The one I go to is not like that. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1488.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's all West Hollywood, so... [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1490.3s)]
*  You can go to a bad gym, though, where people are very broed out, and if you're just not [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1492.74s)]
*  into that, you're just like... [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1497.14s)]
*  I've never had anybody like... [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1498.3s)]
*  All the screaming. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1499.3s)]
*  I mean, negative towards other people that are working out there, which definitely happens, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1500.3s)]
*  but sometimes people chalk up and they get fucking crazy and they push each other. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1504.22s)]
*  Let's go, let's go, let's go. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1508.02s)]
*  Now keep in mind, I just go there to get my dick sucked in the bathroom and I'm out. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1510.1000000000001s)]
*  But I go every day. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1514.66s)]
*  Sometimes I want it, but I do it. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1515.66s)]
*  Don't say what the gym is. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1517.82s)]
*  Is it like an upscale gym or is it like a fucking gold gym type situation? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1518.86s)]
*  I like golds. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1523.7s)]
*  Oh, should I not say it? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1524.7s)]
*  Well, I mean, I like that. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1525.7s)]
*  Don't say it. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1526.7s)]
*  Don't say it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1527.7s)]
*  They're going to fucking find you. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1528.7s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1529.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1530.7s)]
*  They're going to find you and try to suck your dick. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1531.7s)]
*  That's what they're going to... [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1532.7s)]
*  That's what he likes. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1533.7s)]
*  Oh, guys, don't come to this... [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1534.7s)]
*  That's what he likes. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1535.7s)]
*  No, well, you ever have trainers? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1536.7s)]
*  I just don't want to be hard-souled on a trainer, because I go hike by my ass and then I do [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1538.7s)]
*  weight, and I don't have anybody even talking to me while I'm doing it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1545.54s)]
*  Well, there's something to that, right? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1549.66s)]
*  It's like a meditative thing. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1550.66s)]
*  You're just doing your work. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1551.66s)]
*  But you definitely should talk to somebody that can show you good form. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1553.34s)]
*  That's one of the most important things. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1557.82s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1559.82s)]
*  Well, so when I joined, because I remember what I paid before. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1560.82s)]
*  I forgot the biggest hassle of it is the bargaining to not get up-sold on all this shit and just [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1564.78s)]
*  get a basic... [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1570.9s)]
*  So I looked up already what the price should be, because you know, like a variant. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1572.02s)]
*  So I showed a dude on the thing, and he had me come over and talk to him on a table, and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1577.26s)]
*  he goes, okay, so what are your fitness goals? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1580.7s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1582.7s)]
*  My goal is never to listen to your up-sells, ever. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1583.7s)]
*  I'm a 46 dude. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1587.7s)]
*  I'm a clown for a living. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1590.7s)]
*  Yeah, but you have to understand, for some people, say I'm an accountant, my wife's been [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1592.7s)]
*  getting on me, I really should exercise, it's good for my health, and you decide to join [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1597.62s)]
*  a place... [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1601.42s)]
*  You know what I'm going to do? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1602.42s)]
*  I'm going to get a trainer. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1603.42s)]
*  So if you would sit down with that guy, you would appreciate that forethought. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1605.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the kind of thing that is... [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1608.3400000000001s)]
*  I know what I want, so if I say I don't want it, and then you're trying to find a new way [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1612.26s)]
*  in, it's so annoying. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1615.66s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1616.66s)]
*  So you told them that you don't want a trainer. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1617.66s)]
*  You ever do any retail where you have up-sell items? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1618.66s)]
*  Unfortunately, no. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1620.8200000000002s)]
*  Okay, so I used to work. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1621.8200000000002s)]
*  I used to manage a Funco land, it was called, when I was like 19. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1622.8200000000002s)]
*  Was that like a kid's playhouse or something? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1627.14s)]
*  It became GameStop. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1629.18s)]
*  It was like... [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1630.18s)]
*  They merged with Electronics Boutique. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1631.18s)]
*  So it was like buying and selling video games, right? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1635.3400000000001s)]
*  And you could play them before you bought them, that was like a huge deal at the time. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1637.3400000000001s)]
*  And every retail has up-sell shit, so we had to sell cleaners for like... [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1640.3400000000001s)]
*  The whole air things? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1646.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, people would blow on their Nintendo cartridges to make them work. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1647.3400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1651.3400000000001s)]
*  So the cleaners work for those. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1653.3400000000001s)]
*  I would say if you were buying an old Nintendo, that's the only way it would probably even [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1654.74s)]
*  work. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1658.2600000000002s)]
*  I remember that for VCRs too, right? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1659.2600000000002s)]
*  Head cleaners. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1660.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, people would blow on it, which is like worse. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1661.2600000000002s)]
*  I'm already trying to sell you a cleaner. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1663.7s)]
*  So they made them for every system, and then you get some kind of warranty with it, and [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1665.42s)]
*  you would like... [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1670.3s)]
*  It's like 15 bucks, you know, the markup's like 200%. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1671.3s)]
*  So you get commission, right? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1673.78s)]
*  And then you have to hit store numbers for the district manager, you know, like you're [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1676.02s)]
*  expected because that's how they can be sure you're providing great service. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1681.02s)]
*  If you don't sell this many, like 25% sales, we know you're not giving the customers great [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1685.18s)]
*  service because customers need a cleaner. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1689.62s)]
*  So if you're giving good service, they have bought the cleaner. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1691.5s)]
*  So it would create like this thing where it was like just fraud in every store because [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1694.1000000000001s)]
*  you got to... [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1699.14s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1700.14s)]
*  You know, if you're managing, you know the people that are good at this bullshit that [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1701.14s)]
*  you put up out front, and some people that are like, you know, the non-social nerds, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1703.66s)]
*  you have them count shit in the back. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1708.5800000000002s)]
*  But there was always some kind of scam going on because it just created that, like you [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1711.02s)]
*  got to hit these numbers. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1714.42s)]
*  And it was amazing. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1715.42s)]
*  I really, I didn't know that that was like how everything works. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1717.98s)]
*  Everything is like, you got to hit these numbers and everybody just, you know, do whatever [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1723.38s)]
*  con job. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1726.58s)]
*  Well, people need incentive, right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1727.58s)]
*  That's like cops. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1728.8600000000001s)]
*  They give cops like a certain amount of tickets they have to write every month in some places. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1730.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1736.06s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1737.06s)]
*  That's a great system. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1738.06s)]
*  What would you do if nobody sped ever? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1739.06s)]
*  What if like, what if nobody sped, everybody followed the rules for like one month? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1742.54s)]
*  What would they do? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1746.5s)]
*  If they really do have a quota. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1747.66s)]
*  And I know cops have told me they have a quota. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1749.22s)]
*  And I know I've read publicly that that's not true. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1751.7s)]
*  I think it depends where you are though. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1754.42s)]
*  What township? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1756.34s)]
*  Well, it depends on what's the rule and what do they actually tell you you have to do. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1757.34s)]
*  Like is that, are they the same thing? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1762.78s)]
*  Like how does that work? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1764.9s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1765.9s)]
*  Let's find out if that's true. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1767.22s)]
*  What? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1768.22s)]
*  Because I know, I mean, maybe they stopped doing that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1769.22s)]
*  Do cops have quotas for how many tickets they have to write? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1771.66s)]
*  Let's find out if that's true. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1775.74s)]
*  I know cops have told me they have it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1776.98s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you it varies a lot. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1778.98s)]
*  So if you have like a corrupt sheriff, he's like, listen, these motherfuckers. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1781.6200000000001s)]
*  It's probably not even corrupt. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1786.1s)]
*  It's like, we're going to get that money. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1787.1s)]
*  It's like just, I'm sure it doesn't even come off as corrupt. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1788.74s)]
*  You know what the craziest corruption one they had? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1791.98s)]
*  What? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1794.1s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1795.1s)]
*  I think they still do it in some states where if you have like 10 grand on you, they just [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1796.1s)]
*  take it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1799.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, right. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1800.14s)]
*  So they pull you over and you're going to buy a car. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1801.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1803.7s)]
*  You have $10,000 in cash on you. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1804.7s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1806.3799999999999s)]
*  Give me that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1807.3799999999999s)]
*  And then they spend it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1808.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1809.3799999999999s)]

*  You have to go to court for it. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1819.1s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1820.6599999999999s)]

*  What are you going to do? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1845.46s)]
*  It's probably drugs. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1846.46s)]
*  Probably drugs. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1847.46s)]
*  Isn't that hilarious? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1848.46s)]
*  Like if you have so much money, that's how lucrative drugs are. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1849.46s)]
*  They assume that if you have a lot of cash on you, you're selling drugs. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1853.1000000000001s)]
*  They don't think you're selling MAGA hats. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1856.38s)]
*  Basically what I see is that it's not legal to have a ticket quota. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1858.26s)]
*  Regardless of the rumors, ticket quotas are a myth. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1863.22s)]
*  In fact, they're illegal in most states. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1865.98s)]
*  But I've seen multiple things that say there's like unspoken evidence suggests there's an [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1869.14s)]
*  unspoken thing about it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1874.94s)]
*  There's always a way around. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1876.5s)]
*  There's lawsuits about quotas in California from ex- [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1877.5s)]
*  It's from ex-police officers. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1880.38s)]
*  Because any job, they're going to judge you by numbers on the board, right? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1883.22s)]
*  How much did you- [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1887.3s)]
*  Of course. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1888.78s)]
*  Ticket quotas have been prohibited in California for 10 years, but police departments are even [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1889.86s)]
*  now facing lawsuits from their own officers alleging that ticket quotas are real. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1893.42s)]
*  Yeah, there's a law about it in Texas. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1899.54s)]
*  So maybe it's like a thing where they try, like, listen, man, you want to get ahead in [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1901.42s)]
*  this business? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1906.7s)]
*  I'm sure it is some- [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1907.94s)]
*  You got to sell the cleaner. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1908.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think everything is that. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1909.94s)]
*  Because there's always a rule. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1912.3799999999999s)]
*  I always hear that about- who was I watching? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1914.46s)]
*  I was watching like, I see there are FBI, CIA guys, but they're talking about- or I [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1918.26s)]
*  think it was a CIA guy talking about selling coke to fund the contra, something like that. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1922.54s)]
*  They're like, that's illegal. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1927.06s)]
*  We're not allowed to do that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1928.58s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, the mafia, it was illegal to sell- it was a death penalty if [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1929.58s)]
*  you were caught selling drugs. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1934.1399999999999s)]
*  And yet somehow, they still sold a lot of fucking drugs. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1935.46s)]
*  A lot of fucking drugs. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1939.06s)]
*  Very strict penalties. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1940.58s)]
*  Probably more strict than even agencies. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1941.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1944.06s)]
*  Everybody outsources. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1945.06s)]
*  It's always outsourcing. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1946.06s)]
*  Yeah, we don't do, what do you call it, gain of function. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1947.74s)]
*  Like, pay a guy to do it. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1951.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we don't do it. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1954.14s)]
*  I'm not guilty of that. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1955.14s)]
*  We don't fund gain of function. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1956.14s)]
*  We fund the lab. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1957.14s)]
*  Yeah, so there's always a way around. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1958.14s)]
*  Remember when they did the- when they got the torture program and they went to- [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1960.14s)]
*  Did you- sorry, go ahead. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1965.5s)]
*  But that was like bringing jobs back to America kind of in a way, because they used to send [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1967.18s)]
*  somebody to a country that does do that. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1970.74s)]
*  And then in the, you know, the second Iraq war when they made it legal, that was what [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1973.22s)]
*  was so creepy about that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1977.9s)]
*  Was to make it like, now we can do it. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1979.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you remember Michael Rupert? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1982.22s)]
*  No. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1986.1000000000001s)]
*  Michael Rupert was a friend of mine. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1987.1000000000001s)]
*  He was a really nice guy. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1988.58s)]
*  He was like one of the first guys to gift me mushrooms. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1989.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1993.7s)]
*  Just randomly as a gift. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1994.7s)]
*  He was a cop who busted the CIA selling crack in South Central and using it to fund the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=1996.38s)]
*  war- [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2005.14s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2007.5400000000002s)]
*  And he called it out in a courtroom on television. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2008.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2010.94s)]
*  I saw a video of it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2011.94s)]

*  No. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2016.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was gonna say. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2017.94s)]
*  No, he wasn't- I don't think it's even suspicious. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2018.94s)]
*  I think he took his own life. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2022.0600000000002s)]
*  I think he was very depressed. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2023.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I bet. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2024.2600000000002s)]

*  No. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2039.94s)]
*  It's a wild movie. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2040.94s)]
*  I don't know what the original premise was, but he sits down and he smokes cigarettes [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2042.3799999999999s)]
*  through this entire film. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2049.74s)]
*  It's just a guy talking and talking about the imminent collapse of civilization due [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2050.74s)]
*  to our dependence on fossil fuels and just wild shit. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2056.2999999999997s)]

*  while it eerily sounds accurate. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2216.98s)]
*  It's like, no, this is crazy talk. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2218.98s)]
*  It's propaganda. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2221.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2222.98s)]
*  Can you speak further into the mics? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2223.98s)]
*  These mics don't seem to be... [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2226.98s)]
*  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2229.98s)]
*  the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2233.98s)]
*  This is on C-SPAN in 96. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2236.98s)]
*  It's still there. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2241.98s)]
*  That's where I'm playing it from. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2242.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2246.98s)]

*  All right. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2252.98s)]

*  Will you please take your seats? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2291.98s)]
*  I will come back to you as we roll back across to the center section. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2295.66s)]
*  Director Deutsch, I will refer you to three specific agency operations known as Amadeus, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2303.74s)]
*  Pegasus, and Watchtower. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2308.8999999999996s)]
*  I have Watchtower documents heavily redacted by the agency. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2310.7s)]
*  I was personally exposed to CIA operations and recruited by CIA personnel who attempted [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2314.66s)]
*  to recruit me in the late 70s to become involved in protecting agency drug operations in this [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2319.42s)]
*  country. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2324.98s)]
*  I have been trying to get this out for 18 years and I have the evidence. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2325.98s)]
*  My question for you is very specific, sir. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2329.02s)]
*  If in the course of the IG's investigations and Fred Hitz's work, you come across evidence [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2331.82s)]
*  of severely criminal activity and it's classified, will you use that classification to hide the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2336.96s)]
*  criminal activity or will you tell the American people the truth? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2343.68s)]
*  Woooooooooooo! [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2350.18s)]
*  Alright, you want to hear the response first from Congressman Julian Dixon and then from [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2357.18s)]
*  the director. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2362.18s)]
*  Wait, wait a minute. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2363.18s)]
*  From your, from your, I'm sorry, sir. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2368.18s)]
*  I will allow the director to speak first. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2374.18s)]
*  Shout out to that lady for taking control, by the way. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2376.18s)]
*  Like a boss. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2379.18s)]
*  If you have information about CIA illegal activity in drugs, you should immediately [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2380.18s)]
*  bring that information to wherever you want. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2389.18s)]
*  But let me suggest three places. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2392.18s)]
*  The Los Angeles Police Department. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2394.18s)]
*  This guy's like something from Colombo. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2405.18s)]
*  I am sorry, others want to hear this answer. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2409.18s)]
*  It is your choice, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Inspector General, or office [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2417.18s)]
*  of one of your congress persons from this. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2424.18s)]
*  I did that 18 years ago, sir, and I got shot at for it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2427.18s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, sir. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2434.18s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2436.18s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, sir. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2438.18s)]
*  And? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2440.18s)]
*  Sir, you have not gotten the mic yet. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2441.18s)]
*  You are not, but wait a minute then, don't speak out of turn. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2443.18s)]
*  Let me say something else. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2447.18s)]
*  If this information turns up wrongdoing, if it turns up wrongdoing, we will bring the [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2448.18s)]
*  people to justice and make them accountable. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2459.18s)]
*  Alright, Congressman Dixon. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2464.18s)]
*  Thank you, sir, for coming. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2467.18s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute here. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2470.18s)]
*  I thought you did not want to be here, but now that you are here, please let us hear [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2473.18s)]
*  and listen. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2480.18s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2481.18s)]
*  Sir, I want to thank you for coming. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2483.18s)]
*  You were at the last meeting. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2486.18s)]
*  The staff probably had the spelling of your name wrong, but we would like to talk to you. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2488.18s)]
*  We have been looking for a couple of days for you, and we want to, we want to make sure [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2495.18s)]
*  that you contact the committee, because obviously you have some valuable information. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2506.18s)]
*  If you want to give it to me privately, if you want to hand it to that aide where I can [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2512.18s)]
*  contact you this evening, please do it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2516.18s)]
*  Don't let us get away without getting a contact for you. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2519.18s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2522.18s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2523.18s)]
*  I'm going to pass it up to him now, so everyone can see that I got it, that would be fine. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2524.18s)]
*  Thank you, sir, and for the record, for the record, Mike. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2528.18s)]
*  Please, please keep the noise down so that we can hear and we can get answers. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2532.18s)]
*  For the record, my name is Mike Rupert, R-U-P-P-E-R-T. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2539.18s)]
*  I did bring this information out 18 years ago, and I got shot at and forced out of LAPD [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2543.18s)]
*  because of it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2547.18s)]
*  I've been on the record for 18 years nonstop, and I'll be happy to give you, Congressman, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2548.18s)]
*  anything that I have. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2552.18s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Rupert. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2553.18s)]
*  Now, if you were cynical and you're watching that, you're like, I think the CIA, fake to [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2557.18s)]
*  CIA guy... [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2563.18s)]
*  Do you think they did? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2565.18s)]
*  ...to go in there. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2566.18s)]
*  I mean, if you were playing 4D chess, no, I don't think so. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2567.18s)]
*  I think nowadays... [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2569.18s)]
*  I think that's really who he is. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2570.18s)]
*  I mean, I know the guy. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2572.18s)]
*  Yeah, I was... [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2573.18s)]
*  Because nowadays, I forget the one whose name... [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2574.18s)]
*  What was she? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2577.18s)]
*  Was she a congressperson? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2578.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2581.18s)]
*  They said it in the description. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2584.18s)]
*  Because I imagine she would be having him taken out of there so he can't say anything. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2587.18s)]
*  Today. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2592.18s)]
*  That's crazy that you're like, hey, let him talk. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2593.18s)]
*  Well, back then, there was no internet. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2595.18s)]
*  You've got to realize, if someone actually had information like that and people suspected [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2596.18s)]
*  it all along, obviously those people weren't shocked. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2600.18s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2603.18s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2604.18s)]
*  Those people in the audience are like, what? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2605.18s)]
*  No way. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2606.18s)]
*  They're selling... [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2607.18s)]
*  They were like, I fucking knew it. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2608.18s)]
*  Everyone was like, I fucking knew it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2610.18s)]
*  That's what they were yelling out. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2611.18s)]
*  Did you ever talk to Rick Ross, the real dude? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2613.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2615.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2616.18s)]
*  The real Rick Ross. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2617.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2618.18s)]
*  That guy's very interesting. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2619.18s)]
*  He was very interesting. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2620.18s)]
*  He's the guy who was in charge of selling the drugs in South Central that was funding the [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2621.18s)]
*  Contras versus the Sandinistas. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2625.18s)]
*  I mean, it's just such... [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2627.18s)]
*  But anyway, you just outsource that and then you have deniability or whatever. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2629.18s)]
*  That's how that works. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2633.18s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2634.18s)]
*  And you can make so much money. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2635.18s)]
*  Or what would you rather do? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2636.18s)]
*  Let all these other people make money doing it? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2638.18s)]
*  These bad people? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2640.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2641.18s)]
*  Somebody's got to make money. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2642.18s)]
*  We have to sell the drugs. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2643.18s)]
*  If the CIA doesn't sell the drugs, who's going to sell the drugs? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2644.18s)]
*  Criminals. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2646.18s)]
*  And also for a good cause. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2647.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2648.18s)]
*  Imagine if that's how they've been funding things forever. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2649.18s)]
*  Imagine if you found out that that's how they fund the UFO program. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2652.18s)]
*  Well, you know, you know what I wonder about that? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2656.18s)]
*  Because that Bob Lazar episode was very creepy when I watched the thing. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2659.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2663.18s)]
*  But to him talking about it, it was eerie to hear him talk about it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2664.18s)]
*  It was very confusing because what he's saying is so out there. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2666.18s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2671.18s)]
*  I'm like, am I a... [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2672.18s)]
*  I'm definitely a fool. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2673.18s)]
*  But am I being a fool here? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2674.18s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's the little eerie part of it. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2676.18s)]
*  But then who would control like... [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2678.18s)]
*  Do you think the president gets to find out about it or do you think it's purely... [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2682.18s)]
*  Supposedly Nixon knew and Nixon took Jackie Gleason. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2685.18s)]
*  Yeah, I know that. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2688.18s)]
*  And Jackie Gleason built a house out of the shape of the UFO that he saw, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2690.18s)]
*  to represent the UFO that he saw. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2694.18s)]
*  And the Jackie Gleason house was for sale just a few years ago. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2696.18s)]
*  It's in like... [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2699.18s)]
*  Was it in like upstate New York? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2700.18s)]
*  I found out about this from this dude who gave me the book Best Evidence by David Lifton. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2702.18s)]
*  He was like a guitarist in a band. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2707.18s)]
*  That's it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2710.18s)]
*  That's the UFO inspired upstate New York house. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2711.18s)]
*  Look at this fucking house. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2713.18s)]
*  Wait, that's not that big a house. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2715.18s)]
*  Well, it wasn't that big a house because he wanted to make it like the fucking UFO. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2717.18s)]
*  So what it was was... [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2720.18s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2722.18s)]
*  I think it's multiple properties. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2723.18s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2725.18s)]
*  So he just started making UFO houses. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2726.18s)]
*  Apparently, this is the rumor. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2728.18s)]
*  What the rumor was was that Jackie Gleason got drunk with Nixon. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2730.18s)]
*  And Nixon's like, you want to see a fucking flying saucer? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2735.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2737.18s)]
*  He's like, yes. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2738.18s)]
*  And then they flew to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2739.18s)]
*  That was the rumor. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2742.18s)]
*  And they showed him like we have actually recovered... [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2743.18s)]
*  They had freezers of them, right? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2745.18s)]
*  I don't know if that's real. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2747.18s)]
*  I've never heard anybody say that they saw a body and have it be like 100% credible. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2749.18s)]
*  Other than maybe that Travis Walton guy who claims to have been abducted in the 1970s. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2755.18s)]
*  He's another one of those guys. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2760.18s)]
*  If he's telling the truth. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2762.18s)]
*  Okay, there are a number of labs we passed through before entering a section. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2764.18s)]
*  Nixon pointed out what he said was the wreckage of a flying saucer enclosed in several large cases. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2767.18s)]
*  Next, he went into an inner chamber. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2772.18s)]
*  There were six or eight what looked like glass-topped Coke freezers. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2774.18s)]
*  I went inside them with a mangled remains of what I took to be children. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2777.18s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2780.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing I remember from this story. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2781.18s)]
*  So I'm conflating this with something else. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2783.18s)]
*  So that's right. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2786.18s)]
*  They did have fucking supposedly dead frozen ones. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2787.18s)]
*  The revelation of the US Secretary holding the corpses of dead aliens shook Gleason to the core. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2791.18s)]
*  And he couldn't eat or sleep for weeks. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2796.18s)]
*  After being confronted by his wife Beverly, Gleason told her the truth about that night and swore her to secrecy. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2798.18s)]
*  The two of them, Jackie and Beverly Gleason, were already in the process of separating. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2805.18s)]
*  The final straw in the relationship would be Beverly breaking her vow and revealing the encounter to the magazine Esquire in 1974. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2809.18s)]
*  As a teaser for a book she was writing about a relationship with the tempestuous, hard-drinking Jackie. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2818.18s)]
*  Oh, the wife sold him down the river. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2824.18s)]
*  I wonder what that article. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2826.18s)]
*  So that article is this where this story first came out? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2827.18s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2829.18s)]
*  Stung and humiliated by the betrayal, Jackie stayed silent until 1986. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2830.18s)]
*  Finally ready to talk, he invited Larry Warren, a flying saucer, evangelist, author, and eyewitness to the Randall Sam... [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2834.18s)]
*  Oops. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2842.18s)]
*  Fucking pop-ups. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2843.18s)]
*  No, I don't want your pop-up. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2845.18s)]
*  No, thanks. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2846.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2847.18s)]
*  Where were we? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2848.18s)]
*  86. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2852.18s)]
*  Eyewitness to the Randall Sam Forest UFO incident to his New York home. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2853.18s)]
*  After a few drinks, Gleason unloaded the whole unbelievable tale to an astonished Warren who spread the story amongst his community. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2859.18s)]
*  However, the story would end there. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2867.18s)]
*  Gleason died a year later having only told his ex-wife and Warren about the once-in-a-lifetime adventure with Nixon. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2868.18s)]
*  The tale would spread like wildfire with the advent of the internet confirming what UFO believers already knew. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2876.18s)]
*  The government knows everything about aliens but reveal it only to the privileged few. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2882.18s)]
*  Huh. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2888.18s)]
*  This is not true. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2889.18s)]
*  Okay, of course, because this is the blog of Skeptoid and not Believe Everything... [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2890.18s)]
*  Oh, this is Skeptoid that wrote this. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2898.18s)]
*  You read on the Internoid, the story doesn't end there. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2899.18s)]
*  In fact, there really is no story. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2903.18s)]
*  The Richard Nixon, Jackie Gleason, dead alien chronicle in a glass case tale now accepted part of UFO internet lore is based almost entirely on hearsay, coincidence, or an imagination and not just the dead alien children in the glass case part. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2905.18s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2921.18s)]
*  Why do they say that? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2922.18s)]
*  Uh, do do do do do do. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2924.18s)]
*  Wait, was the Esquire magazine? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2926.18s)]
*  What is their reasoning for saying that it's not true? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2927.18s)]
*  They're saying it's anecdotal, which is obviously it's anecdotal. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2930.18s)]
*  Scroll up a little bit more. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2932.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2934.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2935.18s)]
*  So it says as critical thinkers, we can't dismiss a story out of hand because it's preposterous, but we can dismiss a story if the facts don't fit together. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2936.18s)]
*  Aha. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2943.18s)]
*  So let's start with the established facts. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2944.18s)]
*  Richard Nixon, Jackie Gleason, Beverly Gleason, and Larry Warren were all real people. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2945.18s)]
*  Beverly and Jackie Gleason were really married, got divorced in 74, 75. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2949.18s)]
*  Jackie and Richard Nixon are friends and played golf on a few occasions. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2954.18s)]
*  Jackie was an enthusiast about paranormal topics with a huge collection of books on the subjects. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2957.18s)]
*  Uh, Florida is a real place. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2963.18s)]
*  Homestead Air Force Base. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2965.18s)]
*  Esquire is a real magazine. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2966.18s)]
*  That's about it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2967.18s)]
*  Uh, little investigation into Nixon's daily diary, uh, reveals that Nixon was in Key Biscayne in February 19th, 1973 for a meeting with the AFL CIO. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2968.18s)]
*  He spent less than 40 minutes speaking and glad handing with guests at Gleason's annual golf tournament at the Inveri, Inveri, Inveri Golf and Country Club, which, uh, at most 10 minutes available to chat with Gleason about UFOs. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2977.18s)]
*  Nothing else in Nixon's diary indicates that the president did or didn't slip his Secret Service detail and go on an alien adventure with Ralph Cramden. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=2992.18s)]
*  But that doesn't mean he didn't do it. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3000.18s)]
*  That just means he didn't write about it in his diary. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3002.18s)]
*  Why would he write about that in his diary? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3004.18s)]
*  Uh, where the story really starts to fall apart is Beverly Gleason's interview with Esquire because it doesn't appear to exist. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3006.18s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3012.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I wanted to- [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3013.18s)]
*  The search of both Esquire's archives and internet in general turned up nothing. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3014.18s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3018.18s)]
*  What did turn up, however, was an article supposedly written by Beverly from the National Enquirer dated August 16th in 1983, discerning readers would note that the Esquire and the Enquirer have different thresholds for veracity and adjust their expectations accordingly. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3019.18s)]
*  That's a very good sentence right there. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3034.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3036.18s)]
*  That's very well-worded. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3037.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3038.18s)]
*  Oh, so it seems like there was no Esquire article, so that's bullshit. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3039.18s)]
*  Yeah, the Enquirer back then, I remember being closer to Weekly World News then, because Enquirer became like celebrity gossip entirely, right? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3043.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3050.18s)]
*  When I was a kid, I remember it having wilder stuff in it. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3051.18s)]
*  Okay, in short, the piece makes Jackie look like a lunatic befitting a spurned wife writing a tell-all about her famous ex-husband, but the book wouldn't show Jack as he's never been seen before to anyone because Beverly never published it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3053.18s)]
*  The Gleason UFO story got picked up by a few other tabloids, but mostly faded into obscurity. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3068.18s)]
*  So here's the thing, though. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3075.18s)]
*  You could, for sure, imagine that his ex-wife wanted to sell a book. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3077.18s)]
*  You could also, for sure, imagine that Jackie would try to stop that book from being sold. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3084.18s)]
*  So there's that. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3089.18s)]
*  Like, maybe he bought her out, maybe, you know, like, how do we know that she didn't actually write a book? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3091.18s)]
*  Now, that's also because Nixon didn't write about it in his diary. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3096.18s)]
*  That doesn't, if Nixon's the fucking kind of guy who likes to get drunk and take people to see UFOs, he's not going to be meticulous about every fucking thing he does all day long. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3100.18s)]
*  And you don't think that they could hide that? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3109.18s)]
*  I like that back then he was only like really open about recording his racist rants. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3111.18s)]
*  But, dude, back then, fucking Lyndon Johnson used to take a shit in front of the reporters with the door open. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3115.18s)]
*  So he could see how big his dick was? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3123.18s)]
*  Well, he was just like, he didn't give a fuck. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3125.18s)]
*  And like he would have a conversation with all of our conversation, but I got to take a shit. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3127.18s)]
*  So he would sit there with his fucking pants down, take a shit in front of them. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3131.18s)]
*  A guy like that, whatever his fucking diary says, that's probably not all that happened. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3134.18s)]
*  That's probably a fucking UFO in that diary somewhere. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3141.18s)]
*  Do you think LBJ would record that he took his shit in front of reporters? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3144.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, took his shit in front of reporters, just let him know how big my cock is. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3147.18s)]
*  That supposedly was he had a thing with that because he had like a huge dick. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3152.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3156.18s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3157.18s)]
*  Ronnie had a giant dick too. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3158.18s)]
*  Dangerfield? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3160.18s)]
*  Yeah, and he used to do shows with a bathrobe on, just only a bathrobe. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3161.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3165.18s)]
*  Naked under a bathrobe. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3166.18s)]
*  It would go out in front of the fucking, I saw him lying like that. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3167.18s)]
*  How do you get the word out? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3169.18s)]
*  When I was a security guard at Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts when I was 19. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3170.18s)]
*  And I was backstage and he was working there and I couldn't believe I could actually see him. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3178.18s)]
*  I would look down the corridor and I saw, I couldn't believe it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3186.18s)]
*  It's Ronnie Dangerfield. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3190.18s)]
*  It's really Ronnie Dangerfield. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3191.18s)]
*  It was one of those things as a kid, you're like, fuck, he's right there? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3192.18s)]
*  I guess a 19 year old, that doesn't even make sense. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3195.18s)]
*  I saw Bill Cosby there. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3197.18s)]
*  Oh, they're gonna tell me you saw his dick. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3198.18s)]
*  No, no, no, I didn't see his dick, but he was wearing a fucking bathrobe. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3200.18s)]
*  So this was during the bathrobe days. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3203.18s)]
*  There's a part in Ronnie Dangerfield's career when he had just made it and didn't give a fuck. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3205.18s)]
*  And he was still partying hard. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3210.18s)]
*  Was this after Go Back to School? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3211.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3213.18s)]
*  It was after the big movies and he would do stand up and just go out there with the fucking bathrobe on. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3214.18s)]
*  This was also like when he was putting together the Ronnie Dangerfield stand up specials. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3219.18s)]
*  Which were the most important stand up specials ever. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3223.18s)]
*  They introduced the world to Bill Hicks, Dice Play, Sam Kinison, Dom Herrera, Lenny Clark. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3226.18s)]
*  Who else? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3233.18s)]
*  Wasn't Jerry Seinfeld on those too? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3234.18s)]
*  I think so. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3236.18s)]
*  I think so. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3237.18s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3238.18s)]
*  Seinfeld might have already been, I think he was already really popular by then. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3239.18s)]
*  But you look back on the Dangerfield ones. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3242.18s)]
*  Like if you got on that Dangerfield special, that was a fucking stamp of approval. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3246.18s)]
*  Like holy shit, you're on the Dangerfield special? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3250.18s)]
*  That was a big deal. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3253.18s)]
*  When was that? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3254.18s)]
*  What was the 80s? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3255.18s)]
*  Those are like 86-ish. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3256.18s)]
*  Because I think Kinison really popped in 86. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3258.18s)]
*  And so it was around that time. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3261.18s)]
*  Because I remember he was fucking murdered on that special. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3263.18s)]
*  Hicks killed on that special. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3267.18s)]
*  Dice murdered on that special. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3268.18s)]
*  Those specials, there was a couple of them. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3270.18s)]
*  They were so big. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3272.18s)]
*  They were HBO? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3273.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3274.18s)]
*  Ronnie Dangerfield's young comedian special. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3275.18s)]
*  And you knew that if those guys came to the fucking Catch a Rising Star or the Improv, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3278.18s)]
*  you had to go see them. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3282.18s)]
*  That's how I found out about so many comedians that became some of my favorites. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3284.18s)]
*  That and the fucking Tonight Show. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3289.18s)]
*  People forget that Tonight Show used to be how you found out about a good comic. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3291.18s)]
*  Wait, did I tell you keyboard Jeff from Comedy Store? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3295.18s)]
*  You know Jeff that passed away? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3298.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3299.18s)]
*  He told me a story. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3300.18s)]
*  I think this has been verified on a podcast. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3301.18s)]
*  But they were doing a code, and Richard Pryor Jr. fucked Sam Kinison up the ass. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3305.18s)]
*  Because Sam Kinison said, I got to know what it's like to be fucked by Richard Pryor Jr. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3310.18s)]
*  And then he did. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3314.18s)]
*  And I think Richard Pryor Jr. has told this on a podcast. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3316.18s)]
*  I would imagine that's possible. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3319.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3321.18s)]
*  Sure. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3322.18s)]
*  That's a wild. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3323.18s)]
*  You're doing coke? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3324.18s)]
*  People get crazy. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3325.18s)]
*  And you surpass the comedy legacy of your father? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3326.18s)]
*  It did his asshole. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3329.18s)]
*  Imagine thinking you can get it through DNA. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3331.18s)]
*  Imagine if it was that easy. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3336.18s)]
*  Like, talented sperm would be so valuable. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3338.18s)]
*  Richard Pryor Jr. slept with Sam Kinison. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3341.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3345.18s)]
*  Laugh at first sight. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3346.18s)]
*  So this is someone telling the story. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3348.18s)]
*  There's a couple other links for that. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3350.18s)]
*  Well, there you have it, folks. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3354.18s)]
*  We've proven that much more than we've proven the Jackie Gleason UFO thing. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3355.18s)]
*  If only we had that kind of anecdotal evidence. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3359.18s)]
*  That actually ends with it saying it could be true. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3365.18s)]
*  That whole skeptical thing. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3368.18s)]
*  The Jackie Gleason thing? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3369.18s)]
*  Yeah, it says there's four possible answers for this. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3370.18s)]
*  And the one before was that it could be true. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3372.18s)]
*  Yeah, that is a possibility. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3374.18s)]
*  Elvis was a DEA agent after meeting with Nixon. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3375.18s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3378.18s)]
*  After we talked, we were talking about Bob Lazar. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3380.18s)]
*  And after I've talked to him, and then I've seen all the interviews that he's done, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3383.18s)]
*  I've talked to the detractors, and I've listened to their take on things, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3387.18s)]
*  I think he worked there, man. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3391.18s)]
*  I think for sure he worked there. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3394.18s)]
*  Whether or not he worked there on something that actually came from another planet, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3396.18s)]
*  that's where it gets weird. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3400.18s)]
*  People who worked there for sure remember him. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3402.18s)]
*  They've told people they remember him. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3406.18s)]
*  He knows his way around the buildings. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3409.18s)]
*  Even Los Alamos Lab, he knows his way around the buildings. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3412.18s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3415.18s)]
*  He knows how to navigate the place. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3416.18s)]
*  So who would know about it? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3418.18s)]
*  That's the thing I always wonder is, was it Nixon, I guess? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3420.18s)]
*  They said he never worked at Los Alamos, but he was on the fucking employee register from that year. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3423.18s)]
*  If you can go there, you can find it. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3429.18s)]
*  So they lied. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3431.18s)]
*  Yeah, well that makes it suspicious when, like, why do you need to lie about a guy who is making it up? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3432.18s)]
*  I think he thought they were going to take him out, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3437.18s)]
*  so he spilled the beans as hard as he could spill the beans. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3440.18s)]
*  It really is, because that guy we just watched on C-SPAN, you don't have to come kill you. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3444.18s)]
*  It could just make you... [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3450.18s)]
*  Make you look nuts. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3452.18s)]
*  Yeah, and if you just learn about things, it's awful. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3453.18s)]
*  Like, I started smoking more weed while I was watching that C-SPAN thing. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3455.18s)]
*  It really is horrible. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3460.18s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3461.18s)]
*  I don't recommend it. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3462.18s)]
*  I know. That's the thing, you're working with Jimmy Dore now, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3464.18s)]
*  and because you're working with Jimmy Dore, Jimmy's constantly exposing insane corruption that no one's talking about. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3466.18s)]
*  Constantly. And constantly calling people out. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3472.18s)]
*  It's all shit that I wouldn't know about because nobody talks about it. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3475.18s)]
*  Right. You don't hear about it. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3479.18s)]
*  It really is, and it's stuff that... [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3481.18s)]
*  It's the regular... [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3483.18s)]
*  The weird thing, I was telling Jamie, is it'll be, report on something, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3484.18s)]
*  and then I'll notice the other news, YouTube and elsewhere, reporting on it later. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3488.18s)]
*  Like, four months later, they're talking about it. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3494.18s)]
*  Like, an embargo's been lifted when you're allowed to review the... [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3497.18s)]
*  Yeah, things get to a point where they're so prevalent in the news that you kind of have to address them now. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3501.18s)]
*  There's a thing where, if you want to have access to the people, you're going to have to be doing part PR for them. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3506.18s)]
*  Or you're out of the club. So all these people that he's had on... [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3513.18s)]
*  This is what I like about him, is all these people he's had on, if they don't do the thing they said, he brings it up. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3516.18s)]
*  He doesn't politely... [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3521.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3523.18s)]
*  You know, he doesn't do any of that team shit where you're supposed to like, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3524.18s)]
*  I know this is a lie, but we have to go with it because the bad people could win. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3527.18s)]
*  They all do that. And that's not journalism. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3531.18s)]
*  You can't get it from those forms anymore, because they're holding water for so many different entities. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3535.18s)]
*  It's so hard for them to just spit facts. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3542.18s)]
*  And I think the way you two guys do it together is so refreshing, because it's like, true. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3546.18s)]
*  Like, you go over facts and details, and then you're constantly cracking jokes. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3551.18s)]
*  It's like, there's levity to it. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3555.18s)]
*  I'm kind of just like, well, I'm doing like, just watching it, laughing. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3557.18s)]
*  It creates an effect, I think, to have a laughy guy. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3561.18s)]
*  Well, it's also, it's a perfect... Your type of joke writing is like, perfect for that kind of shit. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3565.18s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3571.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like, it syncs up with you. You're a quick... [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3572.18s)]
*  Well, if I give him stuff... [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3575.18s)]
*  Because I like to have more time for my first angry thoughts to at least try to marinate into Clevers, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3578.18s)]
*  because they don't come out. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3584.18s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3585.18s)]
*  He's good at delivering like... [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3586.18s)]
*  Angry and funny at the same time. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3587.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's very good at delivering that. So it works like, it's a good... [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3589.18s)]
*  Rather than like, tweeting. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3592.18s)]
*  Right. That's the worst way to do it. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3594.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably the worst way to do it. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3596.18s)]
*  It's just, in all contexts, it's lost. Everything's lost. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3598.18s)]
*  It's also like an inform... You know, when they talk about people want to take your information, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3603.18s)]
*  I didn't really understand it. It doesn't just mean like a corporation. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3607.18s)]
*  It means just all kinds of people looking to see if they can find something that they could like, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3610.18s)]
*  make a name for, talking about that you tweeted. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3615.18s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3618.18s)]
*  So there's always also that. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3619.18s)]
*  Well, that's a whole ecosystem now, calling people out for things. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3620.18s)]
*  It's an ecosystem. It's people that only destroy. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3624.18s)]
*  Business being destroyed right now. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3626.18s)]
*  Well, there's people that that's all they do. Like all the... You want some more of this? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3628.18s)]
*  That's all they do is call people out. That's like, that's their only contribution. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3632.18s)]
*  Which is great if you're... [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3637.18s)]
*  I can't believe how much that became the real news. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3638.18s)]
*  Because they don't pay for... They don't want to pay to do journalism, so they just... [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3641.18s)]
*  All the people that just got there start doing that, moved up through the ranks into real news. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3645.18s)]
*  Yeah, bizarre. And then it functions like real news. That's how real news functions. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3649.18s)]
*  And also, you know, when the rise of these independent things like Jimmy Show, and Crystal and Kyle, and Sager. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3655.18s)]
*  You know, these people who are trustworthy. Like you could count on them to give you information. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3664.18s)]
*  They have opinions and perspective, and they might have their own biases, but they're not liars. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3670.18s)]
*  And they don't own... They're not owned by... [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3675.18s)]
*  Well, a lot of them do get money from... You'd be surprised... [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3677.18s)]
*  It's been very surprising who gets money from what since I've been at James Bond. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3680.18s)]
*  I don't think any of those guys do. The guys that I just mentioned? Jimmy doesn't. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3684.18s)]
*  All the Ukraine stuff, especially... Here's what's really creepy to me. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3688.18s)]
*  It's all slow to mention how fucked up the Ukraine situation is. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3692.18s)]
*  And the other really eerie thing is... I remember this before I did anything with Jimmy Show, like in 2018. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3699.18s)]
*  They were constantly reporting on like, Ukraine's got a Nazi problem. That was a huge... [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3705.18s)]
*  On all the major things they would say... [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3710.18s)]
*  And corruption. Deep, deep corruption. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3712.18s)]
*  Yeah, and so now, if you look in New York Times, he showed it. The celebrated Azov battalion. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3714.18s)]
*  They've even dropped saying the Nazi part. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3720.18s)]
*  Wow. Did you see the thing of John Stewart hanging the metal on the Nazi's neck at Disney World with a Mickey Mouse behind him? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3723.18s)]
*  No. What? Yeah, that's one of the ones we did. The guy covered it up though. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3729.18s)]
*  Oh, were you talking about Sketch? No. What do you mean? In real life. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3733.18s)]
*  Hold on, explain that. What did you... [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3737.18s)]
*  It was for... It was like the Warrior Games at Disney World, and a hero, an Azov hero, one like best guy on the team. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3739.18s)]
*  I don't know how there's time to go to Disney World, but John Stewart hangs a metal on his neck, and he's got a red... [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3748.18s)]
*  In the photo, he's got a red thing covering it up. It's one of those black sun, you know, the Himmler... [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3753.18s)]
*  I think it's like the occult thing, right? He's got that on his elbow. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3758.18s)]
*  What? Yeah. That's a very... Oh, there he is in the... Yeah, okay, that's the guy. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3761.18s)]
*  But look at the picture of the guy in the hospital with... Look at him, he's a sweet, sweet make-a-wish kid with a black sun. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3767.18s)]
*  Is that real? Yeah. The thing is creepy is this is... All the regular news reported this up until, abruptly, now it doesn't come up. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3774.18s)]
*  Which I can understand if, like, we were at war. So he had something covering up his arm? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3784.18s)]
*  Yes, he's got a thing covering it up. So he had a thing to cover up his tattoo? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3789.18s)]
*  Yeah, but... Wow. I mean, holy shit. Walt Disney's dream coming true. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3793.18s)]
*  Yeah. Is that wild? Well, did you ever see the thing that happened with Candace Owens? No. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3801.18s)]
*  Where Candace Owens was talking about how corrupt the New York Times is. So the New York Times tried to play gotcha with her. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3806.18s)]
*  Oh, really? And they said, what are you referring to? Like, what references? And she goes, your own fucking newspaper. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3810.18s)]
*  And she sent them all these links from 2017 from the New York Times talking about how corrupt Ukraine is. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3817.18s)]
*  There's like a... When a narrative shifts like that, and you don't say what Russia is doing is absolutely horrific. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3824.18s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts about it. But this is a place that is also... Those people don't deserve that. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3832.18s)]
*  The people that are citizens there, they don't deserve bombing. That's not what I'm saying. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3838.18s)]
*  What I'm saying is like, the government has always been criticized there. And now it's not. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3842.18s)]
*  No, now it's... It's totally... I've heard this line three times. Yeah, it's corrupt, but they're trying. I've heard that over and over again. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3847.18s)]
*  They don't deserve to be attacked. Like, I think there's a lot of parts of that fucking... Right. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3856.18s)]
*  None of this should be happening. There's some kind of proxy thing here. It's very weird that we spent more on this than Russia spent doing the invasion. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3861.18s)]
*  We now surpassed what Russia has spent. But what about this FTX thing? Oh yeah, well... That's where it gets crazy. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3871.18s)]
*  Which I love is, they're all reporting on like, how could this happen? Like, you know, he would play League of Legends while he's on the phone doing a $20 million deal. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3878.18s)]
*  And then, who was it? Goldman Sachs? Somebody's like, I love this kid. They all think it's great. How could they think it's great? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3886.18s)]
*  Because he's a rich kid with connected parents. If he was just some jerk off the street who looked like that, they wouldn't be like, oh, this is great. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3893.18s)]
*  Well, his mom was a big Democratic party operative, right? Wasn't she something along those lines? Yeah, also MIT, the guy at the SEC that he would talk to was a MIT professor. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3901.18s)]
*  Hold on, go back, Jamie. What did you just show me? I was trying to find the actual thing and that wasn't it, but this is what he was talking about. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3910.18s)]
*  Crypto's biggest crash saw a guy playing League of Legends while luring investors. So while he was looking for... He was playing this fucking game while he was talking to the investors? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3915.18s)]
*  If you just pay a bunch of money to the media, which is what he did, they'll just write things about how great you are. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3924.18s)]
*  That's the other thing. He donated it. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3931.18s)]
*  He was a jerk off, they'll write your... because there's only two kinds of stories. My friend, she told me it's either puff, outrage, it's like puff pieces or hit pieces. That's all they do. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3933.18s)]
*  That's how you get people to look at it and whatever. So you can bribe these companies to do puff pieces. That's what he did. Isn't that wild? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3942.18s)]
*  The guy from Shark Tank, they asked him, he's like, I'd work with him again. I think he was actually one of the guys that got paid too. Of course. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3952.18s)]
*  I think he's one of the spokespeople, wasn't he? Kevin O'Leary? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3960.18s)]
*  He had to give some fun disclosures on that video where he's like, before we get started on this, let me tell you that all my business accounts are involved in FTX and I've invested in that. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3964.18s)]
*  Dude, there's a video of him on Shark Tank tearing apart some guy who brought a Ponzi scheme to him. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3971.18s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3976.18s)]
*  In fact, where did I see it? I think it's Coffeezilla. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3977.18s)]
*  Maybe he believes in this kid. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3980.18s)]
*  Yeah, but if you know the right people, his brother works with like a GAP or something, a guard against pandemics. Every single thing that you would see... [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3981.18s)]
*  Did you see what the young lady said? She posted it on Twitter about regular amphetamine use. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3993.18s)]
*  Oh, the chick? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3998.18s)]
*  Making people see, make life, what does she say? Makes real life seem silly. See if you can find out what her post was. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=3999.18s)]
*  But she was talking on Twitter about how consuming amphetamines on a regular basis, here it is, made non-medicated life seem dumb. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4006.18s)]
*  Oh, no shit. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4016.18s)]
*  Did you see the obvious things they're saying? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4018.18s)]
*  What a fucking... nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal non-medicated human experience is. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4021.18s)]
*  That is a hilarious thing to say from someone who in April 5th of 2021 is responsible for how much money? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4030.18s)]
*  Dude, but you know what's crazy? They're all whacked out on legal prescription drugs. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4037.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're whacked out on... there's another thing that he was taking in a transdermal patch. He was taking Schledgling or something like that. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4043.18s)]
*  I just watched that dude, he's like a weightlifter guy. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4050.18s)]
*  More dates, yeah. More dates, Derek. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4053.18s)]
*  That guy knows all the chemical... was he like a chemical engineer? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4055.18s)]
*  No, man, he's just fucking super smart and reads research. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4058.18s)]
*  I know, it's so funny people are like... [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4061.18s)]
*  I thought he was a chemist. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4063.18s)]
*  Everybody I ever knew that was some kind of fitness freak knew a lot of shit about... they weren't like stupid people that shouldn't do research. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4064.18s)]
*  They were way ahead of everyone else I knew. You know how like weightlifting supplements... [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4071.18s)]
*  Oh yeah, man, listen. I know a lot of people that know a lot of shit about like when you should eat for the maximum amount of absorption of the protein. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4078.18s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4085.18s)]
*  How many grams per pound of body weight you have to take. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4086.18s)]
*  That kid with that Schledgling, that's amazing. A kid that out of shape is like weightlifter knowledge of nootropics. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4089.18s)]
*  A bodybuilding guy. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4097.18s)]
*  That's his body. His body is his mind. His body is just carrying his mind around. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4099.18s)]
*  What are the effects he said it does where it makes you like enjoy doing like boring work or something? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4103.18s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was something along those lines. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4110.18s)]
*  We'll find Derek's video on it because Derek describes it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4112.18s)]
*  But the Schledgling one, he had like a nicotine patch. It was like a patch. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4115.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4119.18s)]
*  So it's just like getting that slow drip of whatever the fuck that Schledgling stuff is all day. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4120.18s)]
*  That stuff stays in you for a while. Those kind of things stay, those ones where it stays for a while, you can't just go off it. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4123.18s)]
*  Transdermal? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4128.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4129.18s)]
*  Not the patch, the chem, yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4130.18s)]
*  I don't know what it's 20 minute video. I don't know what the part would be. Maybe... [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4132.18s)]
*  Just start it, yeah, right there. That's the stuff. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4136.18s)]
*  That's the stuff. I'm Sam. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4139.18s)]
*  Lay this. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4141.18s)]

*  Sup guys, Derek, morepleatsmoron8s.com. Today we're talking about Sam Bankman Fried and his nootropic use, his drug use, his cognitive enhancing, dopaminergic enhancing drugs that he's using to stay cognitively fucking dialed, dude. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4148.18s)]
*  For being the hyperproductive entrepreneur that he is, bro. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4163.18s)]
*  So if you haven't seen, I'm sure you've probably seen if you're clicking this, the FTX debacle. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4167.18s)]
*  He's all in the news and has been for a minute now. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4172.18s)]
*  So apparently this guy went from a billionaire to nothing essentially overnight from this complete bullshit. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4175.18s)]
*  So apparently this guy went from a billionaire to nothing essentially overnight from this complete disaster of a situation. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4181.18s)]
*  If you want some insight onto exactly what happened, check out Coffeezilla, high quality information on a regular basis in a highly entertaining format. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4206.18s)]
*  Highly recommend his channel for anything crypto scam related essentially or anything financial. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4215.18s)]
*  You know who has a good thing on FTX that is not making any conclusions to this guy, Upper Echelon Games. I watch a really good... [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4221.18s)]
*  It's actually like great. I can't remember what it is, but it's about FTX when it fell and he doesn't claim anything. He just shows like it's worth watching. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4229.18s)]
*  That other guy, the guy who was the head dog at Google, was it Google or Facebook? Chamath? Where was he from? Is he from Google, right? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4237.18s)]
*  I think he runs at the venture capital fund. I don't know. He probably used to work there. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4247.18s)]
*  But wasn't he like the top guy of Google? Anyway, he's a billionaire and he really understands it. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4251.18s)]
*  He actually reached out to them, contacted them and said, you should form a board. They told him to go fuck himself. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4257.18s)]
*  That's literally what they said. Go fuck yourself. He's a fucking billionaire financial guy who actually understands how money works. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4265.18s)]
*  He said, this is what you guys got to do. And they were like, go fuck yourself. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4273.18s)]
*  Do you think the new tropics were making them arrogant? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4277.18s)]
*  They're on speed all day, man. These guys are jacked up on speed. They're making billions and they're fucking each other. All of them. All nine of them. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4280.18s)]
*  In a house in the Bahamas, it just smells like nerd fucking. Just nerd fucking. Just taking Mountain Dew and sledgling, using a track ball. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4288.18s)]
*  These tweets on the side of this are crazy. This is probably what he's talking about. What's he saying? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4296.18s)]
*  It says like, M. Sam has fatal side effects when eating with meat products. Yeah. Oh, so is that why he's a vegan? Pathological gambling and hypersexuality. Yeah, it's that fearlessness. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4300.18s)]
*  Pathological gambling and hypersexuality. Have you heard of this before? I've heard of this with other drugs. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4308.18s)]
*  Well, one of them, Reequip. You know what Reequip is? Reequip is a Parkinson's drug that got pulled from the market. Is that what it is? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4314.18s)]
*  This is Reequip? It says it's developed to treat depression or Parkinson's and is off label, alertness and focus benefits. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4325.18s)]
*  But is it the same drug? Is it Reequip? It could be re-nail-check. It could be Reequip. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4331.18s)]
*  Maybe. Find out if it's the same thing as Reequip. Because Reequip, they lost a court case where a guy became a gay sex and gambling addict. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4334.18s)]
*  I remember that. He was a heterosexual guy with Parkinson's. He had a little bit of a shake. And so he starts taking this drug and he just can't stop sucking cock and rolling dice. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4343.18s)]
*  He's just out there compulsive. Compulsive. Wildly compulsive. Like finding people on ads and just fucking them and they fuck him. Wild shit. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4351.18s)]
*  Couldn't believe what he was doing. He just lost his fucking mind. And they attributed it to the drug. Successfully. I think he got hundreds of thousands of dollars in the settlement. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4361.18s)]
*  Well, there was an ad. I can't remember what drug it was for. And I remember hearing it. I want to say it was antidepressant. But you would hear like, if you feel a sudden urge to gamble, contact your doctor. That's an odd. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4370.18s)]
*  But with this guy, it's crazy because I don't know that there were other cases that were similar. I just heard of this one. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4382.18s)]
*  The only thing that must have happened, if they're saying that on the commercial, that must have happened. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4389.18s)]
*  Right. But is it the same drug? Are we talking about the same drug? Or is it other drugs that make you gamble too? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4393.18s)]
*  Any of those ones that are, you know, with the suicidal ideation or whatever they call it, happens more. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4398.18s)]
*  I mean, there's something that inhibits your fear, your anxiety. You know, your anxiety about all kinds of things. But like, it could be for death too. You're supposed to be afraid of taking your own life. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4406.18s)]
*  But it could... I think it inhibits some people. Well, also taking other people's lives. You know, that's the correlation, not causation, that people make with psych drugs and shooters. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4417.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, Tom Cruise, when he said Matt Lauer was being glib, I laughed. But you know what? Matt Lauer was being glib. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4426.18s)]
*  Well, he, Matt Lauer thought that he was informed. Because that's what we were told. We were told that there's a chemical imbalance. And it turns out that that's not based on anything. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4432.18s)]
*  Like this, that whole thing about people that are depressed have a chemical imbalance. Yeah. That's been... It's in the commercial. I forgot. They go, it's thought to work this way. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4441.18s)]
*  The wording is legally, not that they know this. They go, we think it works. And it was right in the commercial. And I didn't remember that from the commercials. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4450.18s)]
*  I think they're allowed to say, we think it works that way. But I think now they know that that's not necessarily the case. What is the case now when they say... [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4457.18s)]
*  So the statement used to be that there was like a measurable chemical imbalance that certain people had that was leading them to be depressed. And now they're saying that's not something that can measure. Isn't that correct? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4467.18s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I don't know. I saw that. Find out what that is. An article came out where they said like, that's not... They said that's not true. It was based... Well, there's a lot of really crazy ones you find out. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4481.18s)]
*  Like the amyloid plaque one with Alzheimer's. Yeah. Turns out it was horse shit. It was based on fraudulent data. Yeah, it was... Oh, I didn't hear that. It's based on fraud. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4491.18s)]
*  Popular theory about depression wasn't debunked by a new review. So it wasn't debunked. This is from technologynetworks.com. So psychiatry gave up on the chemical imbalance theory a long time ago. They're saying, oh, so they're saying maybe it's a common thought and they're saying it like it was a recent thing, but it wasn't. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4501.18s)]
*  Okay, wait. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4524.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4554.18s)]
*  The reaction of many academics briefly as obviously in comments UK based science met medical media center. Dr. Michael... Wait a minute. This is this is some kind of I'll bet you this is some industry fucking thing because all they're saying is, oh, no, no mental health professional says that. But people think that. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4562.18s)]
*  Well, let's go back up again. I want to finish what he's saying. So he says the findings from this umbrella review are really unsurprising. Depression has lots of different symptoms. And I don't think I've met any serious scientists or psychiatrists think that all causes of depression are caused by a simple chemical imbalance in serotonin. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4582.18s)]
*  But that's not what they're saying. They're saying they do say sometimes that there's a chemical imbalance in serotonin that causes depression. That's people have always said that. So that's what people were saying. They're not saying that's the only reason why you're depressed. But see how he's wording this. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4599.18s)]
*  But they market it to you, even though in the company. Well, okay. I don't remember the name of the drug, but the old commercial I saw played. And so they're saying right there, we think it's out. They're not guaranteeing it in the commercial. But everyone I knew remembers it as, oh, it's that simplified thing that they're all saying none of them were ever saying. Well, maybe they weren't in charge of marketing, but the people in charge of marketing were making it seem very much like that's the thing. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4616.18s)]
*  So there's different doctors scroll back up. There's different doctors who do a better job of explaining it. And this guy, or better to me rather, a doctor, Professor Phil Cohen, Cowan or Cohen. I'm not sure they're saying what I'm saying. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4640.18s)]
*  Professor Sarco. Yeah. Psychopharmacology at the University of Oxford said no mental health professional would currently endorse the view that a complex heterogeneous condition like depression stems from a deficiency in a single neurotransmitter. So he's saying that it's probably more things. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4654.18s)]
*  Do you see down there when it says that it was heavily pushed by drug companies? Yes. So that's exactly that. Read that. Yeah. 88% of respondents believed the chemical imbalance to be the cause of depression. This idea, the authors point out, was heavily pushed by drug companies aiming to sell serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor compound. So read for Eli Lilly. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4669.18s)]
*  Oh, Eli Lilly, for example, promoted their compound Prozac in 2008 with the following. Many scientists believe that an imbalance in serotonin, one of these neurotransmitters may be an important factor in the development and severity of depression. Prozac may help to correct this imbalance by increasing the brain's own supply of serotonin. That's from the commercial. I remember that. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4695.18s)]
*  And so there's all these maybes and we don't know. But you don't remember that. You just remember, oh, that's what causes it. Exactly. I saw an animated diagram of what causes it. So they're not totally lying. It's just the way wormy advertise. Yeah. So gross. That's the thing. Ask your doctor. Yeah. Oh, okay. Like, that's fucking crazy. And your doctor's supposed to be telling you what you should take. And you're asking your doctor about that. All of a sudden, there's a big panic of like, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4716.18s)]
*  wait, don't ask your doctor about these ones right now. They've been telling people to ask their doctor and all of a sudden, but don't even look. Not not the off label stuff. Can't make any money. Who would ever use things off that? That is using. What is he using? Parkinson medicine to steal your money. You know what that is? It's an affinity scam. Like, you know, made off prayed on a lot of Jewish people because they trusted him. There's called an affinity scam when you try to prey on a fellow something. And this kid [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4746.18s)]
*  that's an affinity scam of fellow connected rich people. They all trust. Oh, he's that his pedigrees impeccable of his family's connections. That was someone who's trying to explain to me Epstein. And we were talking about it. The Epstein Island thing. Like, why would people go there? And I'm like, because other people were there. Yes. But it's also if you like fucking Bill Clinton. For sure. We're safe. Him and Tony Blair. They'll show up at anything. If you give them the right amount, they'll sit with this kid in board shorts and like, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4776.18s)]
*  Unkempt hair and talk about crypto. But that is one of the wildest things that Epstein did is get all those prominent people to go. And it's not just guilt by association. It's also like it's a greeting card for all the other people. Yeah. Like, have you ever been invited to a party and someone they'll tell you someone famous is going to go? Yes. It's a weird thing. If you go, Drew Carey might be there. Like, oh, Drew Carey might be there. I'd like to meet you care. Yeah. Why? And plus, you know, all the the famous like gift basket. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4806.18s)]
*  It's an award shows. Sure. Like celebs love getting like hooked up. Like, that's a thing of any of the things that's a good side effect of if you're in any kind of show business, like when you get hooked up, like, yeah, you're like, oh, I could go backstage at a thing. Get free Ray bands. Yeah. So like at all levels, they love that at all levels. Yeah. There used to be like a place you'd go for like these award shows. And there was these tents. And you got the first time I met Ice Cube. I was like, what's up, Ice Cube? We were both in this fucking stupid tent. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4836.18s)]
*  And they were they were giving away all kinds of shit, man. They were giving away like fucking trips to places, free trips. They give you free trips. They give you jewelry. This is for what? For whatever. Some stupid award show. I don't even remember which one it was. I remember the Emmys. I got a free basket, but I didn't get I wasn't getting like the whatever primo Emmy thing. But I got a T-shirt of Bruce Lee as a DJ that yes. Yes. It's like a six hundred dollar T-shirt. Really? Or some. It was so funny. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4866.18s)]
*  Something like that, because I remember seeing an Iron Man. Tony Stark is wearing it. And but that was like it's all that kind of stuff inside. They would custom make you a pair of shoes. But you had to. I never bothered to go. That's hilarious. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4896.18s)]
*  Take my handmade shoe coupon. Yeah. They they always did that stuff. It's like it might have been the Emmys because but I went to a few of those things. I had to go to one of those when Phil Hartman was nominated for an Emmy. Oh, really? [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4910.18s)]
*  And this is after he was murdered. So the whole cast, the whole cast of news radio is sitting in the audience just hoping that Phil's going to win. And Phil didn't win. The dude from Frasier won.

*  Frislebs is the one FTX did, which is a shit ton of money. Yeah. Oh, that's better than the fake money than a designer T-shirt. If that if that guy didn't go to war with that other guy, that's what happened. Right. That dude dumped all of his coins. He sold all his coins. I really couldn't cover it. Yeah. Yeah. That was his like rival. Yeah. They had he had a whole back door installed in that. So his kind of house, one of girlfriend or whatever she's called, she's like, well, I'm gonna go to war with the guy. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=4976.18s)]

*  some other white guy, the reporter, the woman, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5075.14s)]
*  and then I can't remember the black guy's name, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5078.5s)]
*  but she's like, first hearing the non-binary thing. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5080.7s)]
*  So now they're in a bad spot, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5084.34s)]
*  because you're supposed to immediately go along with that. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5086.18s)]

*  And this is really screwing up their narrative [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5091.3s)]
*  of whatever they were gonna say this person was, right? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5093.26s)]
*  And so they had to turn the black guy, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5098.18s)]
*  because they're like, I hope, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5099.620000000001s)]
*  because we're white, we can't say anything. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5101.38s)]
*  I hope this is enough of a shield for us [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5104.18s)]
*  to say we don't wanna accept that this shooter [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5106.740000000001s)]

*  from that guy Adam Curry on here, ESG, a long time ago, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5120.7s)]

*  It's wild. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5139.58s)]
*  That's what FTX did. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5140.7s)]
*  They're profiting off of a mind virus. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5141.86s)]
*  You could juke the numbers however you want [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5144.339999999999s)]

*  as a person who just made mistakes. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5178.66s)]
*  The whole point of giving somebody a shit ton of money [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5181.22s)]
*  is not so you have to give them orders of what to, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5183.22s)]

*  because the people I know who would maybe say that, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5532.38s)]
*  that aren't bots, or they're either like real plugged in [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5535.26s)]
*  and it's a real social, it's a real social credit [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5539.62s)]
*  in some circles, I guess, is how I take it. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5543.0599999999995s)]
*  But I know they just now learned [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5545.42s)]
*  it wasn't called the Ukraine probably around February. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5547.26s)]

*  into all these different fake accounts [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5576.42s)]

*  which is what Elon said when he bought Twitter. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5580.38s)]

*  I wonder about that, like what he learned in the course of, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5584.74s)]
*  because that was a real roller coaster ride, right? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5588.299999999999s)]
*  That everybody forgot about it for a minute. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5590.9s)]

*  I bet. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5593.9s)]
*  Yeah, he learned some shit. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5594.74s)]
*  And I think that's probably why everybody got fired. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5595.78s)]
*  I mean, I think he probably felt like a lot of people [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5600.0599999999995s)]
*  weren't necessary or he wanted to put all new people in. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5602.22s)]
*  But I also, from what things that he said publicly, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5605.14s)]
*  like there's some shit going down. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5609.780000000001s)]
*  Like what those people were supposed to do [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5611.820000000001s)]
*  and what they were actually doing [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5614.18s)]
*  and the way they were censoring people, it was real. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5615.34s)]
*  Well, you just watch this stupid, like, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5618.62s)]
*  I'm sure that he, anyone there that got cleared out, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5621.700000000001s)]
*  I have no, ooh, I'll bet they were really valuable. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5625.46s)]
*  I don't even, I don't even think of it for a second. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5629.34s)]
*  I see them reporting, I'm like, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5631.900000000001s)]
*  these are the people that made it great. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5632.900000000001s)]
*  Like, are they? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5634.1s)]
*  I bet they weren't. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5635.02s)]
*  Well, you've seen the Project Veritas videos on that. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5635.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5637.740000000001s)]
*  They talk to people about openly, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5638.58s)]
*  like stopping people's tweets from getting out, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5640.660000000001s)]
*  shadow banning them. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5643.46s)]
*  It's all not conspiracy. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5644.9800000000005s)]
*  First of all, the idea of a shadow ban, just to begin with, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5646.46s)]
*  how is that okay? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5649.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5651.660000000001s)]
*  There's some guy, I think that's an upper echelon video too. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5652.5s)]
*  The guy that came up with it, with some creep, like, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5655.5s)]
*  so he's like creepy, like tech people. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5659.82s)]
*  They're all like, you know, like a Reddit moderator [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5662.179999999999s)]
*  level kind of person, which is, you know, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5666.419999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you know how brutal that is, [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5668.62s)]
*  but he came up with that, like as a little, like, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5670.66s)]
*  wouldn't it be a great way, like, to just ban, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5673.9s)]
*  and they don't even know why they're banned, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5675.62s)]
*  and it just took off through the whole industry. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5676.86s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5678.58s)]
*  It's wild that that's a real thing. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5680.0599999999995s)]
*  How's that allowed? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5682.179999999999s)]
*  It is allowed though. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5683.259999999999s)]
*  Somehow or another it's allowed, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5684.259999999999s)]
*  and you and I are probably both on it. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5685.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5687.82s)]
*  You. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5688.66s)]
*  Let me hit this weed again. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5691.62s)]
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5694.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm sure like all these people are gonna. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5697.099999999999s)]
*  Well, all these people are freaking out [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5699.42s)]
*  because Elon is opening the gates to everybody to come back. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5700.58s)]
*  Yeah, they're all mad about the wrong things, you know? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5705.299999999999s)]
*  He's like, if you haven't committed a crime, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5707.219999999999s)]
*  you should come back. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5709.54s)]
*  I don't think he's right about the Alex Jones thing. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5710.54s)]
*  Well, I think he believes that Alex Jones [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5713.34s)]
*  lied on purpose to profit. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5716.14s)]
*  Well, here's the weird part. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5717.900000000001s)]
*  Alex Jones didn't get kicked off of Twitter [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5718.9800000000005s)]
*  for saying anything about Parkland. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5720.900000000001s)]
*  No, he didn't. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5722.46s)]
*  He got kicked off for making fun of Oliver Dorsey [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5723.3s)]
*  and saying something like, he's like, I forget it, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5725.54s)]
*  something like an animal coming out of another animal's ass. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5728.42s)]
*  Something along those lines. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5731.46s)]
*  I forget what he said. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5732.5s)]
*  But the point is, I think Elon's point was that [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5733.820000000001s)]
*  he said that his son died, his first child, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5738.26s)]
*  I believe it was his son, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5743.34s)]
*  his first child died in his arms. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5744.74s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5747.0599999999995s)]
*  And that anybody who would profit off of a child's death or [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5749.0599999999995s)]
*  doesn't he work with the Pentagon? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5753.86s)]
*  Or anyone who would profit off of, like. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5759.7s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Taliban's on Twitter. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5761.7s)]
*  Yeah, like. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5763.74s)]
*  But the point is, knowing Alex, that is not what happened. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5765.0199999999995s)]
*  Alex had a genuine psychotic break. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5769.139999999999s)]
*  He was losing his fucking mind. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5772.38s)]
*  He was drinking heavily. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5773.78s)]
*  And I think he really truly believed [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5775.7s)]
*  a lot of things that weren't true. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5778.0199999999995s)]
*  Because he was finding out so many things that were true, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5780.0599999999995s)]
*  he was going crazy. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5782.98s)]
*  Well, you know. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5784.139999999999s)]
*  And also drinking a lot. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5784.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, that always helps. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5786.219999999999s)]
*  He really did have like a moment where he said, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5787.86s)]
*  I just was losing my fucking mind. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5791.099999999999s)]
*  That doesn't excuse it, right? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5793.9s)]
*  It's just the fact. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5795.74s)]
*  That's what was going on. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5796.86s)]
*  I feel like. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5799.139999999999s)]
*  The guy's right about a lot of shit, man. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5799.98s)]
*  If you look at his hit rate, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5802.98s)]
*  there's a thing that's like eerie. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5804.099999999999s)]
*  People would say he's a fucking agent. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5808.54s)]
*  I hear that all the time. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5810.299999999999s)]
*  And when I, you think of the amount of things [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5811.54s)]
*  that were right, but he said them, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5814.62s)]
*  and like the frogs are turning gay. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5815.74s)]
*  That famous clip, right? [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5817.62s)]
*  That's based on a real story about pollution [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5819.259999999999s)]
*  that's actually affecting wildlife. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5820.98s)]
*  It's actually an important story. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5823.419999999999s)]
*  So he's referring to something that's a real thing. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5825.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's making, it's doing something fucked up [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5828.0599999999995s)]
*  to their hormones. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5830.299999999999s)]
*  And I think it makes them intersects [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5831.14s)]
*  or something along those lines. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5832.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's important. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5834.3s)]
*  But why are you saying it like that? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5835.14s)]
*  Because then it makes it easy to dismiss. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5836.740000000001s)]
*  Because he's funny. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5838.900000000001s)]
*  That's the thing about Alex is like, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5840.22s)]
*  half of what he does is like the entertainment value. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5842.26s)]
*  But then it's all interwoven in with real shit. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5845.58s)]
*  Like he'll say shit and you're like, what? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5849.1s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5850.820000000001s)]
*  They had to stop giving the polio vaccine to kids in Africa [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5851.860000000001s)]
*  because they were giving them actual polio. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5854.06s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5855.820000000001s)]
*  And you hear that and you go, well, that's not true. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5856.660000000001s)]
*  That can't be true. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5857.9800000000005s)]
*  Dude, that's, you know. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5858.820000000001s)]
*  And then we went to a fucking AP article [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5859.94s)]
*  where they showed that that polio vaccine. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5862.0599999999995s)]
*  When it first came out in America, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5865.46s)]
*  that's the birth of, I never heard of this. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5867.099999999999s)]
*  Here's how I found out about it. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5869.54s)]
*  I was looking up for something else for a joke for the show [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5871.18s)]
*  and I was looking up polio [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5873.66s)]
*  because I got that when I was five in the eighties, right? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5874.98s)]
*  Well, that's when it was perfected. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5877.9s)]
*  It was perfectly good when I got it. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5878.86s)]
*  Apparently, and it's not because it was bad, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5880.099999999999s)]
*  the vaccine itself was bad. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5881.78s)]
*  It's because the drug company that first manufactured it [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5883.54s)]
*  accidentally put live polio into it. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5886.22s)]
*  So it was the actual pharmaceutical company fucked it up. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5888.42s)]
*  And then some people got polio from it [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5891.42s)]
*  and that was the birth of being hesitant about vaccines. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5893.58s)]
*  People weren't just like, oh, it's black magic. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5896.74s)]
*  Something happened. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5899.66s)]
*  And here's the creepiest part of this article that I read. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5900.7s)]
*  This wasn't someone arguing against the COVID vaccine. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5903.46s)]
*  This was when Trump was in office still [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5908.22s)]
*  doing Project Warp Speed [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5910.58s)]
*  to make sure the vaccine was gonna get made. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5911.9s)]
*  And they were all talking how it's bad [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5914.78s)]
*  because Trump's doing it. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5916.42s)]
*  So this guy writing this like, hey, slow down, Trump. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5917.54s)]
*  You should know why some people might be hesitant. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5919.86s)]
*  If that was, like, I'm sure that same guy [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5923.18s)]
*  would be exactly the opposite on command. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5926.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5928.9s)]
*  On today. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5929.74s)]
*  That's the thing that's creepy. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5930.58s)]
*  That is kind of creepy. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5931.42s)]
*  That it's like, it's not fact-based. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5932.5s)]
*  It's what does the ideology support? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5934.18s)]
*  What does the cult want? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5936.7s)]
*  The cult wants this. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5937.86s)]
*  Vaccines are good. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5939.26s)]
*  And if you, isn't there a strain of polio [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5940.46s)]
*  that's specifically from that? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5943.54s)]
*  There's a vaccinated strain of polio [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5946.9s)]
*  that some people are catching? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5949.099999999999s)]
*  Let's find out if that's true. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5950.74s)]
*  Yes, now. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5951.74s)]
*  Is that the thing about New York? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5952.7s)]
*  There was something with the water supply [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5953.94s)]
*  they thought was causing polio? [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5955.22s)]
*  I think, no, I think they detected levels of polio [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5956.86s)]
*  in the waste supply, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5960.46s)]
*  which would indicate that polio is in the area. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5962.3s)]
*  I think that's what there is. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5966.0599999999995s)]
*  Let's find out one at a time [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5967.46s)]
*  because I wanna make sure that the vaccine case [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5968.5s)]
*  of polio is true. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5970.74s)]
*  Because I think I heard Jimmy say it. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5971.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it was something that Jimmy talked about. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5973.74s)]
*  I remember that article talking about them saying it, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5975.58s)]
*  but I don't remember what the update of it was. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5977.34s)]
*  I think that's what the assertion was. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5980.62s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5985.06s)]
*  Detection of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 2. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5986.3s)]
*  Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented type [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5990.2s)]
*  of poliovirus that is mutated from the strain [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5993.78s)]
*  originally contained in the oral polio vaccine. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=5996.62s)]
*  The oral polio vaccine contains a live weakened form [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6000.66s)]
*  of poliovirus. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6004.98s)]
*  I didn't get oral as a kid. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6006.5s)]
*  So there's a poliovirus 2. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6007.9s)]
*  Oh, weird. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6011.36s)]
*  That is vaccine-derived. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6012.379999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6014.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's what they were talking about. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6015.0199999999995s)]
*  I got a shot when I was a kid. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6016.419999999999s)]
*  I didn't get it oral. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6017.7s)]
*  No, the oral one was the one that the AP [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6018.54s)]
*  was talking about with kids. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6021.36s)]
*  They were giving it to kids in Africa [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6022.86s)]
*  and they were winding up getting polio [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6024.66s)]
*  from the polio vaccine. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6027.58s)]
*  That's what Alex talked about. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6029.299999999999s)]
*  And that's what I was like, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6031.459999999999s)]
*  there's no fucking way that's true. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6032.299999999999s)]
*  Pull that up. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6033.299999999999s)]
*  And he pulls it up. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6034.14s)]
*  And it's not a wacky website. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6034.9800000000005s)]
*  It's AP news. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6036.34s)]
*  The scary thing is when you read, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6037.700000000001s)]
*  that stupid thing of what if somebody, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6039.9400000000005s)]
*  by the way, I got vaccinated. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6042.5s)]
*  But people are saying things like, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6044.5s)]
*  what if someone you love needed a bed [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6046.54s)]
*  and then they couldn't get one in the hospital [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6049.18s)]
*  because an unvaccinated person was taking up the bed. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6051.02s)]
*  I heard this repeated a lot. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6054.06s)]
*  It's already, but this is the thing [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6056.700000000001s)]
*  I didn't think of at the time. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6058.06s)]
*  It's already stupid on the face of it [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6059.5s)]
*  because when they come out and I'm sorry, [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6061.02s)]
*  there's an unvaccinated person [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6063.54s)]
*  and your loved one has to die. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6064.78s)]
*  Why are there not enough beds? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6069.06s)]
*  If you know a pandemic is coming, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6070.42s)]
*  wouldn't you think there'd be enough beds? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6071.74s)]
*  They purposely run [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6073.14s)]
*  because it's all private equity that owns the hospitals. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6074.22s)]
*  They run it that way on purpose with not enough beds [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6076.7s)]
*  because it's not cost effective to have enough beds. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6079.1s)]
*  And if you look it up, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6081.86s)]
*  I read this in an article that was bragging [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6083.26s)]
*  about how great this is. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6084.900000000001s)]
*  It was like an industry thing. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6086.74s)]
*  It was that way to provide more efficient care [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6087.58s)]
*  and you can focus on preventable. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6089.74s)]
*  It wasn't a thing exposing it. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6091.98s)]
*  It was a thing explaining why it's great [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6093.419999999999s)]
*  that there's not gonna be enough beds for now on. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6095.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the creepy shit. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6097.62s)]
*  So do they, well, they don't plan for a pandemic, right? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6098.9s)]
*  It's not like the hospital should have all these beds [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6102.78s)]
*  running 24 seven, plan for. In 2018. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6105.78s)]
*  But once the pandemic hits, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6108.419999999999s)]
*  like how much resources would be involved [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6110.139999999999s)]
*  in making sure there's enough beds? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6113.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, in a lot of places, there were enough beds. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6114.7s)]
*  That wasn't even a thing that there weren't enough beds. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6117.66s)]
*  Well, that was the thing too. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6119.54s)]
*  It's like, there was a lot of propaganda [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6120.58s)]
*  about people that were clogging up. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6122.98s)]
*  Remember this story? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6126.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fake story. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6127.34s)]
*  They clogged up the emergency room in Oklahoma [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6128.18s)]
*  because they were having ivermectin overdoses [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6130.46s)]
*  and there was no room for the gunshot wounds. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6132.94s)]
*  Right, and there hadn't been a gunshot wound in that town. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6134.86s)]
*  It was all worth it. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6137.9s)]
*  The sheriff had to call, yeah, and Rolling Stone ran it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6138.74s)]
*  By the way, that was great. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6141.54s)]
*  The Yen winner, that clip is unbelievable. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6142.58s)]
*  That clip was so strange. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6145.26s)]
*  It really shows you like, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6146.62s)]
*  cause I always wondered like, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6147.98s)]
*  what in the hell this like credulous, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6148.82s)]
*  like we watched John Stewart talking to Hillary [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6151.74s)]
*  in Condoleezza, did you see that? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6154.7s)]

*  Oh, it's brutal, dude. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6157.7s)]
*  And you can even see on his face. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6159.0599999999995s)]
*  But, and it's like, you could see he's like, [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6161.38s)]
*  like Luke Skywalker, like, I know there is good in you. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6167.099999999999s)]

*  And the two of them are horrible. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6173.58s)]
*  And the things they're saying like, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6175.099999999999s)]
*  I don't even know how you get through the video watching. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6176.82s)]
*  We didn't, we had to stop at every like minute. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6179.5s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6180.98s)]
*  Oh, the arrogant. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6182.22s)]
*  It's just unbelievable. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6183.94s)]
*  It's a foregone conclusion that it's great for us [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6185.099999999999s)]
*  to keep going everywhere and regime change, [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6187.94s)]
*  whatever the hell we do that, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6191.54s)]
*  like an alcoholic, like this time is gonna be better. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6193.139999999999s)]
*  So what they're saying? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6196.34s)]
*  I've had people say it to me point blank of like, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6198.0599999999995s)]
*  well, Iraq wasn't, you know, they weren't really, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6200.0599999999995s)]
*  they couldn't really have democracy like culturally, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6202.98s)]
*  but like, Ukraine's got a shot at it [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6205.0199999999995s)]
*  because they're more, you know, stuff that's like, [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6207.5s)]
*  maybe not, I don't know if outright racist, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6209.98s)]
*  but chauvinistic, let's say, you know? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6212.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6215.34s)]
*  But just the idea it's gonna, this time, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6216.18s)]
*  it's gonna work. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6218.02s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6219.38s)]
*  Also like, what does that make Ukraine? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6221.58s)]
*  If Ukraine wins in the Ukraine, do they join the UN? [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6224.86s)]
*  Do they never join the UN? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6229.78s)]
*  Are they a part of NATO? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6231.38s)]
*  You mean NATO, or they're not in the UN? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6232.22s)]
*  Or NATO, they're not in. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6234.5s)]
*  NATO rather. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6235.58s)]
*  Excuse me, NATO. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6236.42s)]
*  Right, I've had a lot of marijuana, folks. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6238.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6240.9800000000005s)]
*  If they do join, does, I mean, isn't that like the big, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6241.9400000000005s)]
*  that was the big sticking point? [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6246.74s)]
*  Yeah, if you watch it, we play all the clips of it. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6248.82s)]
*  I mean- [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6251.22s)]
*  That was what Dave Smith has said, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6252.06s)]
*  that was the big sticking point, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6252.88s)]
*  was that they're moving their weapons closer and closer [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6253.72s)]
*  towards the Russian border, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6257.02s)]
*  and that if they could get them to join NATO. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6259.26s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of people that think that, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6262.5s)]
*  yeah, NATO should expand as much as possible, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6264.1s)]
*  and it should go everywhere. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6266.780000000001s)]
*  Like, you could hear Condoleezza and Hillary, [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6267.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, imagine two of them, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6269.660000000001s)]
*  just, that's what I'm watching John Stewart sit through. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6271.3s)]
*  What do you think was going through his head? [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6275.02s)]
*  I think he's like that, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6277.780000000001s)]
*  remember they had that rally to restore sanity? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6279.14s)]
*  And it was like a real middle, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6283.26s)]
*  it's really like, the Obama years were great for me, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6285.9800000000005s)]
*  festival is really what you call it. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6289.14s)]
*  And a bunch of people I know, in their minds, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6290.740000000001s)]
*  it was great when Obama got in. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6294.139999999999s)]
*  And I liked Obama, I was all for Obama at the time, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6297.0599999999995s)]
*  I had no idea of any of the actual things he was doing, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6301.0599999999995s)]
*  or like the drone wars, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6303.94s)]
*  and then now you realize the left and right is like, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6305.419999999999s)]
*  if you're left, America left, [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6307.879999999999s)]
*  you're for advanced robot killing. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6309.7s)]
*  Of mostly innocent people. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6313.7s)]
*  Of mostly, I mean- [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6315.299999999999s)]
*  Grossly. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6316.419999999999s)]
*  You're like 90%, that ain't a good, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6317.46s)]
*  can you say collateral damage at that point? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6319.5599999999995s)]
*  It's collateral survivors at that point. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6321.58s)]
*  Yeah, the amount of actual people that they target, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6323.94s)]
*  that get killed, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6327.22s)]
*  somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6328.58s)]
*  So they made it like- [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6330.18s)]
*  90%. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6332.06s)]
*  A combatant, somebody who could be a combatant, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6332.9s)]
*  at one point they made it anybody over the age of 15, [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6336.5s)]
*  some creepy thing like that, right? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6338.86s)]
*  That was during Obama, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6340.26s)]
*  so then you could just legally do this stuff. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6341.26s)]
*  Trump made it so they don't even have to report, [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6343.9s)]
*  they don't have to report the numbers. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6346.18s)]
*  So those are your choices. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6349.22s)]
*  It's like a left Twix and right Twix. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6352.06s)]
*  Can you imagine you're on your way to a fucking wedding, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6354.9800000000005s)]
*  and you hear missiles that get launched from robots, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6359.06s)]
*  because you've got so many cars [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6362.18s)]
*  headed to the mountains, they assume. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6363.56s)]
*  I have wanted to get out of going to a wedding really bad, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6365.9400000000005s)]
*  and so I'm not the right, but I see what you're saying. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6368.700000000001s)]
*  But those are the horror stories you always hear, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6372.1s)]
*  like a wedding party. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6374.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, then they gotta, just unbelievable. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6375.9400000000005s)]
*  It's the same sort of cop logic [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6379.06s)]
*  that'll allow you to steal $10,000 [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6381.0599999999995s)]
*  for some kid about to buy a Camaro. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6382.22s)]
*  Cop logic's a good, that's what they sounded like. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6384.22s)]
*  Good guys, bad guys. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6387.74s)]
*  They had cop logic. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6388.66s)]
*  Well, that was what Julian Assange exposed [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6390.22s)]
*  in that video that was so damning. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6392.14s)]
*  That moment where that guy, it was a helicopter, right? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6394.26s)]
*  Launched those missiles at the photographers, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6399.18s)]
*  and then there was kids that were in a van, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6402.38s)]
*  and he was like, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6404.14s)]
*  well, they shouldn't have their kids with them. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6404.98s)]
*  Which is- [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6407.54s)]
*  Remember the guy that they got by drone [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6408.419999999999s)]
*  that looked like Adrian Brody, kind of, a la Lockie? [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6410.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6414.419999999999s)]
*  And his son had gone to find his dad, you know? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6415.459999999999s)]
*  And so was with him and died too. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6418.9s)]
*  And I remember people now who would be like Warhawks saying, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6421.379999999999s)]
*  he's an American citizen, they just executed. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6425.86s)]
*  Now, when they got him at the time, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6428.419999999999s)]
*  I remember thinking, hey, citizenship revoked, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6430.5s)]
*  motherfucker, that's how I felt. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6432.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6434.0199999999995s)]
*  It didn't even occur to me that if you just, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6434.9s)]
*  they're gonna do that there, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6437.98s)]
*  what do you think they'll do to you at home? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6439.259999999999s)]
*  Not give you the same treatment when it comes down to it? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6440.66s)]
*  Whatever they do over there, they're gonna do to you [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6443.299999999999s)]
*  when it's convenient. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6445.98s)]
*  Like any kind of fucking gangster. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6447.219999999999s)]
*  That's how it is. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6448.82s)]
*  But I had no concept of that. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6451.46s)]
*  I remember, on 9-11, I was there, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6452.98s)]
*  and I remember everybody was on board with, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6455.46s)]
*  yeah, that makes sense, go to Iraq. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6458.38s)]
*  You just gotta show them all. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6460.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, the idea was- [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6461.9s)]
*  Shocking all of them, you know? [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6462.74s)]
*  You can't ever have this happen again. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6463.62s)]
*  Shocking all. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6465.38s)]
*  I think it's really great how Islamic fundamentalist terrorists [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6466.62s)]
*  have kind of just stopped wanting to attack us. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6469.3s)]
*  I guess they see we have so many other things on our plate. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6471.74s)]
*  You know, how you never, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6474.0199999999995s)]
*  it was the biggest, most important thing, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6476.86s)]
*  and you never hear about it now. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6478.78s)]
*  Do you remember when we had the scale? [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6480.5s)]
*  Like it's orange today for possible terrorist attacks. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6482.58s)]
*  Remember they tried that for a little while? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6486.62s)]
*  A lot of people don't remember. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6488.18s)]
*  Do you remember it, Jamie? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6489.5s)]
*  The orange, yeah. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6490.74s)]
*  It was on TV. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6491.58s)]
*  Today's yellow. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6492.98s)]
*  Relax, go outside, go to the park, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6493.98s)]
*  where the government is paying attention. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6496.14s)]
*  Just to have, I mean, that's at the time [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6498.86s)]
*  that came across to me like a- [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6500.86s)]
*  National Terrorism Advisory System. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6502.3s)]
*  You know, taking your shoes off at the airport, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6505.1s)]
*  that's a good- [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6507.06s)]
*  It was one fucking guy. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6508.1s)]
*  DHS replaced the color-coded alerts [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6509.54s)]
*  of Homeland Security Advisory Systems [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6512.06s)]
*  with the National Terrorism Advisory System in 2011. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6513.86s)]
*  So they ran that shit for a few years, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6518.9s)]
*  and they gave it up. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6521.74s)]
*  And the way it works is like, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6522.94s)]
*  you get funding for these stupid things. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6524.46s)]
*  So they could be idiotic, and they'll just go, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6525.98s)]
*  we're gonna take our shoes off at the airport forever. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6528.38s)]
*  And that's how I think about every like- [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6530.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6532.42s)]
*  Every single thing. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6533.259999999999s)]
*  Well, it was one guy, right? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6534.08s)]
*  One guy tried to blow a shoe up. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6534.92s)]
*  Then they could have just looked at his shoes. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6536.259999999999s)]
*  His shoes had visible fuses coming out of them. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6538.5s)]
*  He was trying to light it while he was sitting next to people. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6540.7s)]
*  Hey, just take a peek at their shoes, maybe. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6544.38s)]
*  People stopped him from doing it. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6547.0599999999995s)]
*  Like he's there with a shitty lighter. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6548.9s)]
*  So dumb, oh yeah. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6553.74s)]
*  Oh, the Ron Jeremy one. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6555.5s)]
*  He's got the shoe right there. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6557.259999999999s)]
*  Did you ever talk to that guy, John Kierkehal, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6558.98s)]
*  or call him? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6560.66s)]
*  No. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6561.5s)]
*  He's an interesting dude to talk to, a CIA guy. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6562.32s)]
*  He's the one that revealed the torture program. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6564.0199999999995s)]
*  Richard Reed was the guy, right? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6565.46s)]
*  So all under his shoes- [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6567.339999999999s)]
*  That's the shoe ball of Richard Reed. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6568.42s)]
*  Was explosives. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6569.259999999999s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6570.46s)]
*  You imagine being on a fucking plane [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6572.98s)]
*  and you see a guy lighting his shoe, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6575.339999999999s)]
*  and you're like, oh my God. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6577.38s)]
*  I know, he already, especially if you're like, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6579.82s)]
*  okay, I don't want to be phobic and just assume this guy [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6582.58s)]
*  who has a real terrorist look in his eyes. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6585.1s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6589.06s)]
*  His look in his eyes, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6589.900000000001s)]
*  like he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6590.900000000001s)]
*  Look at his eyes. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6593.06s)]
*  He expected to be- [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6593.900000000001s)]
*  How many of those guys that they talk, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6595.9400000000005s)]
*  remember that guy that they talked into doing [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6597.58s)]
*  that fake bomb? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6599.14s)]
*  The FBI courted him. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6600.58s)]
*  They convinced him that he should blow up this fake bomb, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6602.82s)]
*  and they gave him a cell phone to blow up the fake bomb, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6607.42s)]
*  and then when he tried to activate the fake bomb, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6609.259999999999s)]
*  they arrested him. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6610.9s)]
*  Wait, what kind of- [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6611.74s)]
*  Is this Islamic terrorist? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6613.46s)]
*  He was 19 years old. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6615.259999999999s)]
*  You know, they do that. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6616.099999999999s)]
*  I remember at the time looking up what's the most common, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6616.98s)]
*  because at the time, it was an argument about Islamic [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6619.339999999999s)]
*  terrorism, how dangerous, right? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6621.339999999999s)]
*  That was the big argument. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6623.0599999999995s)]
*  So I wonder what it is with the most terrorism. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6624.9s)]
*  I looked it up, and it was like 2011. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6626.339999999999s)]
*  Eco-terrorism was the number one. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6628.98s)]
*  I was like, eco-terrorism? [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6631.099999999999s)]
*  I guess because it's mostly against property, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6633.139999999999s)]
*  but there's a guy who, he got it. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6634.74s)]
*  I guess how entrapment works is not how [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6638.78s)]
*  I would have thought entrapment works. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6640.78s)]
*  You could have a kind of shitty person go in undercover [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6643.0199999999995s)]
*  and make up a plan with some guy who's like weak or stupid [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6646.94s)]
*  and wouldn't have done it otherwise, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6650.9s)]
*  and they got regular, there's like 300 or something cases [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6652.54s)]
*  of that with Islamic terrorists, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6655.179999999999s)]
*  but before that, there was a famous one with some kid [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6656.86s)]
*  who was like a virgin, and they got a girl to fuck him [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6659.74s)]
*  and draw up a plan, and he just gave him money. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6662.0599999999995s)]
*  He didn't get some loser, and then you catch him, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6665.54s)]
*  and there's funding. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6666.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Boston Marathon bombers slipped through. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6668.0199999999995s)]
*  In fact, a bunch of shootings, here's a weird commonality. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6671.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of people noticed something wrong [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6674.74s)]
*  and called both their local police and the FBI, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6676.18s)]
*  and they didn't somehow catch it. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6679.3s)]
*  Well, wasn't the Boston bomber an FBI informant? [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6680.86s)]
*  I never even heard that, but. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6684.74s)]
*  Was that true? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6685.98s)]
*  Was the Boston bomber an informant? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6687.22s)]
*  Is that speculation? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6689.78s)]
*  Well, the last thing I saw, because remember Brass Eye? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6691.94s)]
*  It was like a British fake news thing, it was really funny. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6695.58s)]
*  This guy named Chris Morris. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6698.62s)]
*  He made a movie about, and I remember this case in Florida. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6700.62s)]
*  It was like a black Islamic group [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6704.259999999999s)]
*  that had this preposterous plan to ride horses into Chicago. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6706.82s)]
*  Something crazy, but they were set up, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6710.5s)]
*  and I remember on the news seeing, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6712.419999999999s)]
*  remember they were rounding up the homegrown terrorists, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6714.099999999999s)]
*  and they left behind this one guy [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6716.74s)]
*  that he was like really slow. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6718.0599999999995s)]
*  He was the only one left of the, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6720.46s)]
*  you could tell he was the runt of the litter of this thing, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6722.0199999999995s)]
*  and you could tell he was slow, and I remember like, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6726.66s)]
*  I think Bill Maher made a joke about [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6729.3s)]
*  how it wasn't the A-Team of terror, you know? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6730.78s)]
*  It was like that, and so when I saw this Chris Morris [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6733.26s)]
*  interview later, I'm like, oh, I remember those. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6736.42s)]
*  There's all these like, where they caught people [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6738.099999999999s)]
*  and I didn't really know the details of it. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6739.9s)]
*  But the guy was really dumb, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6741.38s)]
*  and they probably just talked him into it. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6743.179999999999s)]
*  Well, how about the Gretchen Whitmer thing? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6744.58s)]
*  There was 14 people that were trying to kidnap her, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6747.34s)]
*  12 of them were FBI informants. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6749.9s)]
*  That's some kind of, it's like the waste of them. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6754.7s)]
*  I mean, but that's hilarious. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6757.66s)]
*  It's like, sounds like some kind of thing [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6758.94s)]
*  to sell more cleaners to me. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6760.74s)]
*  Everything sounds like that to me, [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6762.38s)]
*  like a create these things. Right, it sounds like [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6763.54s)]
*  it can't be real. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6764.94s)]
*  It's something that you have to prove you did something [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6766.18s)]
*  that was in your nature, I think, is the wording, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6768.22s)]
*  which is very strange, but I found that out on a... [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6770.7s)]
*  So they can talk you into doing it [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6774.22s)]
*  because it was in your nature to do it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6775.66s)]
*  How the hell do you have that as law? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6777.54s)]
*  Unanswered question about Tamerlan Tsarnaev. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6780.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6786.9s)]
*  So what are the questions? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6787.74s)]
*  Well, was he an informant? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6789.38s)]
*  Was he an informant? [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6791.0199999999995s)]
*  I didn't get a good answer. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6792.82s)]
*  Was he a federal informant? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6794.18s)]
*  How does a federal informant program work? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6795.38s)]
*  How do federal agents recruit Muslims [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6797.58s)]
*  and other immigrants to become informants? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6800.22s)]
*  And did Tamerlan Tsarnaev, how do you say that? [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6802.18s)]
*  Help me out. Tsarnaev. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6808.22s)]
*  Received special treatment through this program [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6810.18s)]
*  for his application to become a US citizen. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6812.66s)]
*  In 2014, as his dad, Dazklar Tsarnaev, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6814.58s)]
*  prepared for his defense, his lawyers... [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6820.46s)]
*  Dozerzhoris, his name. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6822.26s)]
*  Filed a motion seeking all documents [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6823.42s)]
*  related to FBI contact with Tamerlan. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6826.26s)]
*  Why? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6828.62s)]
*  Oh, that's the other dude. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6830.46s)]
*  They believe that Tamerlan had been a federal informant. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6832.22s)]
*  They wrote, we base this information [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6834.34s)]
*  from our client's family and other sources [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6836.78s)]
*  that the FBI made more than one visit to talk to Tamerlan [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6838.86s)]
*  and asked him to be an informant [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6843.46s)]
*  reporting on the Chechen and Muslim community. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6845.179999999999s)]
*  We base this information from our client's family. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6850.179999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6853.3s)]
*  That's the highlight of things. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6854.139999999999s)]
*  So I tried to read down it to find out any confirmation. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6854.98s)]
*  It's really long. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6856.74s)]
*  There are some ties. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6857.66s)]
*  He's listed in this visual here. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6859.179999999999s)]
*  Because they even approached him, that set him off [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6861.22s)]
*  because he was already going in that vein. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6863.34s)]
*  Is that what I'm... [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6866.02s)]
*  Did see as a boxer, they focused on him in this. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6866.860000000001s)]
*  This is from 2010. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6869.780000000001s)]
*  And what is it about? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6870.740000000001s)]
*  This was like used to sell people. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6871.66s)]
*  This is an excerpt from Boston University [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6874.1s)]
*  graduate student publication. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6875.38s)]
*  The comment which featured him in 2010. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6877.5s)]
*  Scroll back up again where it was... [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6880.22s)]
*  This is just a long article. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6882.66s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6883.860000000001s)]
*  But there was someone, here it is. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6884.700000000001s)]
*  He desperately wanted citizenship in 2010. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6887.54s)]
*  He was featured in a magazine. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6889.9s)]
*  You help us, we'll help you. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6892.58s)]
*  McPhee tells Radio Boston. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6894.339999999999s)]
*  According to... [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6898.0599999999995s)]
*  He went over to Dagestan, I think, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6898.9s)]
*  where he was trying to, according to some officials, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6902.86s)]
*  get involved with some fighters, [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6905.82s)]
*  which according to this then they didn't let him in [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6907.42s)]
*  because of his ties to conspicuous Western culture. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6909.66s)]
*  It says right here. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6913.0599999999995s)]
*  Conspicuous Chechen fighters. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6914.299999999999s)]
*  So that's why I was trying to read... [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6916.46s)]
*  This is a very long article. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6917.46s)]
*  I couldn't find it out. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6918.42s)]
*  I don't even know if this has an actual answer. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6919.26s)]
*  So that's like a perfect guy to approach [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6920.9400000000005s)]
*  to be like, hey, you wanna find stuff? [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6922.780000000001s)]
*  And if he's already paranoid. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6924.7s)]
*  Especially if he's a boxer [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6927.06s)]
*  and he wants to be a US citizen [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6928.42s)]
*  and they can get him to... [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6930.74s)]
*  Similarly, I found this article in New York Times [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6932.42s)]
*  which goes into someone very similar. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6934.34s)]
*  They tried to find a nuclear specialist [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6935.780000000001s)]
*  and get him to do a bomb. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6937.9800000000005s)]
*  And this long article goes into, I guess, he did. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6939.54s)]
*  There's a bunch of these. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6942.18s)]
*  Hold on, was it again? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6943.02s)]
*  He did not go through with this. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6944.42s)]
*  I think he saw through whoever was trying to get at him. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6945.820000000001s)]
*  Same kind of deal, but he... [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6948.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6950.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they do that all the time, I think. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6951.18s)]
*  It's not even breaking the law. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6952.62s)]
*  The law is like you could do a crazy amount of entrapment. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6954.0199999999995s)]
*  So, and I wasn't aware of that, you know? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6957.3s)]
*  That is nuts. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6960.42s)]
*  It's nuts that that's funded by tax dollars. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6961.5s)]
*  To trick people. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6964.58s)]
*  Did you ever see the thing? [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6965.58s)]
*  I just... [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6966.54s)]
*  30 years, despite his concerns of entrapment, this is. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6967.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6970.0199999999995s)]
*  So he wasn't let... [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6970.86s)]
*  Fuck your concerns. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6972.7s)]
*  He got fucked. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6973.78s)]
*  So they still put him away. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6974.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6976.42s)]
*  Why did they put him away? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6978.22s)]
*  Because he was thinking about it? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6979.06s)]
*  Yeah, again, I didn't... [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6980.38s)]
*  Because he was talking to them about it? [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6981.46s)]
*  Did you ever... [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6983.9400000000005s)]
*  Imagine if you're hanging around with dudes [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6984.780000000001s)]
*  who are talking about blowing up a nuke in Manhattan, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6986.54s)]
*  and you're in the same cell as them, same terror cell, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6989.54s)]
*  and you're like, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6992.46s)]
*  yeah, man, sounds like a good idea, sounds like a plan. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6994.18s)]
*  That's one thing. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6997.02s)]
*  And they're recording this, [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6997.860000000001s)]
*  but they turn out to be the FBI, but you are just... [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=6998.7s)]
*  You're never planning on doing it. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7000.74s)]
*  You just think you're freaked out by the fact [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7002.26s)]
*  these guys want to blow up a fucking nuke. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7004.18s)]
*  What do you say? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7006.1s)]
*  If this is your group of people... [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7007.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's what people did [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7008.82s)]
*  when I was doing Sasha's thing. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7009.9s)]
*  Because you're like, why do people... [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7012.0199999999995s)]
*  Because people will sense something weird. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7013.099999999999s)]
*  Sasha Baron Cohen. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7015.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7016.179999999999s)]
*  And they'll sense something weird and go along with it. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7017.099999999999s)]
*  Especially real reality show kind of people. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7019.62s)]
*  They're just like, camera, oh, I just do the thing [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7023.98s)]
*  and don't think about the thing and do it. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7026.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7027.62s)]
*  Or it made the news, but the guy was freaked out [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7028.46s)]
*  and he did try to... [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7033.74s)]
*  Remember there was some news that some guy brought up [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7035.259999999999s)]
*  like a pedophile ring or something? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7037.62s)]
*  There's some guy that thought... [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7038.94s)]
*  It turned out to not be that at all. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7041.0199999999995s)]
*  It was like a guy... [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7042.94s)]
*  But people be scared when they hear you bring up [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7043.86s)]
*  some kind of illegal thing [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7046.139999999999s)]
*  and they might act like it's okay and then go report it. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7047.58s)]
*  Hopefully that's what... [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7050.259999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? Pedophile thing? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7051.099999999999s)]
*  I don't remember the exact thing, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7052.98s)]
*  but one of the guys they did a prank on... [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7054.0199999999995s)]
*  And the first one went around like a rumor that... [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7058.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7060.7s)]
*  Do you know what I'm talking about? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7061.54s)]
*  That's right. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7062.38s)]
*  And I called my friend and he was like... [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7063.219999999999s)]
*  It turned out the guy, he was afraid [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7065.18s)]
*  because he just heard this and went along with the thing. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7066.9800000000005s)]
*  So it was nothing, but people will go along with something [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7069.02s)]
*  if you scare... [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7072.14s)]
*  I mean, especially with five guys. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7073.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7075.58s)]
*  Also some people, they're like... [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7076.42s)]
*  You could get them to talk about almost anything. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7078.46s)]
*  Like there's some people that like... [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7081.1s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7083.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7084.14s)]
*  There's a certain level of unsophisticated person [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7084.9800000000005s)]
*  if you're around them and you start talking about ghosts, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7088.06s)]
*  they're like, oh yeah, yeah. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7090.660000000001s)]
*  They just go with it, right? [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7093.02s)]
*  And then you're talking about Sam Harris on Trigonometry. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7095.7s)]
*  I'm like, holy crap. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7098.7s)]
*  Are you saying this for real? [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7099.98s)]
*  I wish he hadn't used those words. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7103.7s)]
*  Well, I love that he did because it's so... [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7105.7s)]
*  It's such an obvious thing, but a bunch of people [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7109.74s)]
*  not as bright as him would know not to say that. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7112.78s)]
*  He feels very strongly anti-Trump in a way that... [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7117.0599999999995s)]
*  What do they call it? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7120.7s)]
*  Trump Derangement Syndrome? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7121.54s)]
*  Every time I think that's just some kind of phrase, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7123.22s)]
*  I'll see a new example where I'm like, this is amazing. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7125.9800000000005s)]
*  He literally goes, yeah, no, it's a conspiracy. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7129.900000000001s)]
*  That's good, we have to do it. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7132.06s)]
*  Like you're the Dark Knight with the Joker [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7133.18s)]
*  and you got a spy on everybody's phone that one time. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7135.5s)]
*  See, the thing is, it's the one good thing [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7138.38s)]
*  about someone like Trump even being able [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7142.06s)]
*  to become president, which is so crazy. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7145.02s)]
*  It just shows you how bananas this system really is. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7147.820000000001s)]
*  That's the problem with him is that mainly. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7150.740000000001s)]
*  People that think he's gonna help, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7153.26s)]
*  I want to work out for you, but guess what? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7154.9s)]
*  There ain't no help coming. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7157.66s)]
*  I don't think there's help coming either. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7159.1s)]
*  I gave it to Candace Owens, that interview with Trump [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7162.5s)]
*  where she brought up Eric Snowden and Julian Assange. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7164.66s)]
*  And Trump said, he was like, well, I should have... [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7167.46s)]
*  I've never even heard of Trump saying [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7170.3s)]
*  I should have done something different. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7172.7s)]
*  Like that's amazing to get that out of him. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7174.02s)]
*  That's one of those ones where if he did, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7177.18s)]
*  who the fuck knows what would have happened? [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7179.9s)]
*  That's like a fucking take of riding a convertible [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7184.46s)]
*  through Dallas moment. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7186.78s)]
*  All these things I would have dismissed, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7188.54s)]
*  especially stuff like JFK, Oliver Stone. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7190.099999999999s)]
*  JFK's a movie, right? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7195.0599999999995s)]
*  That kind of thing, there's probably an explanation. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7196.42s)]
*  Just the fact that you would delay it another, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7198.82s)]
*  whatever it is. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7200.98s)]
*  55 years, something like that. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7201.82s)]
*  Like automatically, yeah, what could the reason be? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7203.62s)]
*  Is it something good? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7206.94s)]
*  I'm sure you have our best interests in mind. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7208.540000000001s)]
*  You always do. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7211.34s)]
*  Why would you not wanna tell us this right now? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7212.18s)]
*  Yeah, what about this? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7214.34s)]
*  Could people not handle something that happened in 1963? [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7217.26s)]
*  Go. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7221.3s)]
*  Also, what about all the data [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7222.14s)]
*  of the safe, effective vaccine that I got? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7224.3s)]
*  That is, they wanted to hold back for 75. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7227.42s)]
*  Yeah. Really? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7230.5s)]
*  75 years. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7231.34s)]
*  But they're making them do it quicker. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7232.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they judge. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7234.860000000001s)]
*  We don't have enough people to go through [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7236.3s)]
*  and put black, you're allowed to redact. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7238.78s)]
*  Did you see the EU hearings? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7240.46s)]
*  And they're asking about the data, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7245.38s)]
*  and the guy's holding up what they were given, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7246.62s)]
*  and it's all blacked out except for one line here and there. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7248.9s)]
*  That's just the contract with the drug companies [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7251.34s)]
*  that the guy's government made. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7253.62s)]
*  Whew. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7255.66s)]
*  You get, that's proprietary information. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7256.5s)]
*  Well, think about Sam Bankman Fried. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7259.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7262.299999999999s)]
*  Now, multiply that many, many times. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7263.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7265.98s)]
*  That's the amount of money that's rolling around. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7266.82s)]
*  And it's just getting in everybody's pockets. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7268.9s)]
*  It's the same goddamn thing. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7272.34s)]
*  Creating influence everywhere you go. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7273.179999999999s)]
*  Dude, the same people that made, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7275.42s)]
*  what's the movie about, you know, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7276.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7281.38s)]
*  About 2008 thing? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7282.219999999999s)]
*  That thing keeps going. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7283.219999999999s)]

*  Big short. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7286.38s)]
*  The big short. Yeah. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7287.219999999999s)]
*  All that stuff Matt Taibbi wrote about [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7288.98s)]
*  has never been addressed or fixed in any way. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7290.42s)]
*  No. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7292.7s)]
*  No, and Matt Taibbi did a brilliant job [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7293.9s)]
*  of breaking it down to someone [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7295.98s)]
*  who's never studied the markets before [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7297.179999999999s)]
*  and you just go, what? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7298.74s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7301.459999999999s)]
*  That's how you guys were doing this? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7302.299999999999s)]
*  Like, this whole thing is insane. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7303.9s)]
*  And then the whole thing about you have to bail them out [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7306.58s)]
*  and then the people that you bail out [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7309.379999999999s)]
*  are allowed to get bonuses, like giant bonuses. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7311.82s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7314.419999999999s)]
*  You have to give them the bonus [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7315.259999999999s)]
*  because otherwise they're gonna leave [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7316.08s)]
*  and go somewhere else. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7317.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7317.86s)]

*  You ever see WeWork? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7324.94s)]
*  Yeah, what happened with that? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7326.58s)]
*  I don't know anything about that. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7327.42s)]
*  So he got like a billion dollars out of, [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7328.259999999999s)]
*  what was it? [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7329.42s)]
*  It was like a tech company [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7330.259999999999s)]
*  but their tech was selling office space [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7331.54s)]
*  or renting office space, which is not tech. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7334.0199999999995s)]
*  And he just got all, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7336.94s)]
*  and all he had to do was just be barefoot [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7338.099999999999s)]
*  and talk about some kind of goop kind of shit. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7339.58s)]
*  That's all he had to do with rich people. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7342.66s)]
*  He's just, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7343.86s)]
*  I was talking to this dude, Pasta, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7346.34s)]
*  who has a good podcast idea. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7349.099999999999s)]
*  His buddy Steve, we were talking about Hawaii, [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7351.3s)]
*  cause you know he just went through, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7353.38s)]
*  you could make a whole living. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7354.46s)]
*  Steve said, you just bring a didgeridoo to Hawaii [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7357.14s)]
*  and walk along the beach just playing [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7360.18s)]
*  and you could get some kind of patronage eventually. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7361.9s)]
*  And that's like a therapy. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7365.5s)]
*  It really is just a- [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7368.82s)]

*  Like where'd that come from? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7374.74s)]
*  Is it a Maori thing? [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7376.18s)]
*  Is that a New Zealand thing? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7378.26s)]

*  Oey, oey, oey, oey, oey. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7383.94s)]
*  I gotta believe that they never, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7386.82s)]
*  the Aborigines never enjoyed their own didgeridoos [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7388.54s)]
*  as much as a white guy with dreadlocks. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7391.219999999999s)]
*  Wow, look at them. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7396.42s)]
*  Look how cool that looks. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7397.38s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7398.66s)]
*  They're wearing these wild paint all over their body [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7400.46s)]
*  and these crazy outfits. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7405.42s)]
*  I wanna hear that. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7407.26s)]
*  Can we hear it? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7409.54s)]
*  I mean that guy could clean up in Hawaii if he showed up. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7410.38s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7412.82s)]
*  Those guys around the beach. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7414.54s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7415.38s)]
*  It's such a fucking psychedelic sound. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7417.86s)]
*  Yeah right. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7420.7s)]
*  If you were doing mushrooms [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7421.54s)]
*  in like a teepee with a fire in the center of it [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7422.5s)]
*  and you hear that sound. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7425.9s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7427.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7428.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7429.18s)]
*  Oh. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7434.5s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7438.5s)]
*  We're trippin' balls. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7439.34s)]
*  Is he doing a didgeridoo solo right now? [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7440.18s)]
*  Yeah, bro, I'm tripping balls just listening to him. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7442.1s)]
*  Imagine, imagine you hear that sound, and you have like a cold camp, because you're trying to hide, and you're hoping that they don't find you. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7452.780000000001s)]
*  I mean, can I tell you what I appreciate? [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7463.06s)]
*  The Aboriginals are ready to come kick your ass, and you hear this from the top of the mountain. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7465.58s)]
*  Fuck! [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7470.820000000001s)]
*  I'm Tom Selleck in Quigley down under, waiting. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7471.96s)]
*  This guy you can tell is like the Steve Vai of Didgeridoo. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7476.36s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7480.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, I like the... [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7481.88s)]
*  My buddy Adam Greentree works with a lot of Aboriginal people. He runs a mining company in Australia. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7485.28s)]
*  And he said that there's so many languages that... well, they call them mobs. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7492.32s)]
*  Like the different groups of Australia, instead of a tribe, they call themselves a mob. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7499.36s)]
*  And one mob might not understand what another mob a hundred kilometers away speaks. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7503.12s)]
*  Really? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7509.04s)]
*  Yep. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7509.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, no shit. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7510.099999999999s)]
*  He said it's wild. And he said a lot of it's not written down either, unfortunately. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7511.12s)]
*  So, like, if they die, if they die off, and sometimes they'll have like... [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7515.28s)]
*  You know, historically, they were poisoned by people that lived there. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7520.32s)]
*  They were poisoned by the settlers. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7524.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, it's crazy that history. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7526.4s)]
*  They lost like giant groups of them. There's like a cave he was telling me about. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7528.4s)]
*  And if you go there, there's like a whole mob that was killed with poison. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7532.24s)]
*  They gave him poisoned food in this cave. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7536.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, really? It's a really bad... [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7537.6s)]
*  There's Adam. That's my buddy. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7540.64s)]
*  That might have been the cave, but Adam might not be. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7542.88s)]
*  There's a cave that had... it was filled with bones. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7545.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7548.72s)]
*  Quigley Down Under blew us about a lot of that, but they were shooting at originals. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7550.72s)]
*  But it's really wild, what happened. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7554.400000000001s)]
*  Quigley Down Under? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7556.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you ever see that with Tom Selleck? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7557.4400000000005s)]
*  No, I never saw that. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7558.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he shows up and it's all about that, how they were massacring... [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7559.92s)]
*  He wasn't doing it, but I guess Quigley... I don't think it's a real guy. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7563.52s)]
*  They would steal their children and make them be adopted by white people. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7566.72s)]
*  Well, that's a Canada... [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7570.64s)]
*  Quigley Down Under. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7571.280000000001s)]
*  Canada has a whole history of that, right? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7572.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they did that too, I think, right? [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7574.32s)]
*  The pictures, they'll have pictures of the whole thing and they make them in black and white, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7575.5199999999995s)]
*  even though it wasn't black and white. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7578.8s)]
*  It's just like 1975. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7580.8s)]
*  You had to create emotional distance from the event. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7582.24s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, that's crazy. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7584.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, some guys... [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7586.32s)]
*  This was a long time ago, back when there was only paintings. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7586.5599999999995s)]
*  You put it in black and white, you're like, get over it. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7590.4s)]
*  Isn't that funny? That's all you have to do. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7595.68s)]
*  Put in black and white and people are like, oh... [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7597.599999999999s)]
*  There's always subtle things, yeah. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7599.84s)]
*  Make it a Polaroid, like clearly big white strip on the bottom. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7601.76s)]
*  Oh, it's a Polaroid. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7604.56s)]
*  Wait, do you know... [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7605.68s)]
*  I was just thinking... [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7606.8s)]
*  Can you only play that one song of Didgeridoo? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7608.56s)]
*  I've only heard one song. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7611.12s)]
*  Well, I think you get to make your own sort of sound, because there's no... [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7612.64s)]
*  It's all like, what noises you're making in that giant ass tube. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7618.400000000001s)]
*  Did you see that Dune movie where they... [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7623.12s)]
*  The new one they made and the guy, there's like, they're doing some sacrifice. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7626.56s)]
*  No, I didn't see the new Dune. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7630.48s)]
*  Oh, there's a cool part. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7631.839999999999s)]
*  Was it good? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7632.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty... [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7633.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, I thought I'd done as well as you could do it. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7634.32s)]
*  And, but the guy's doing that throats. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7637.759999999999s)]
*  It's not... [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7639.919999999999s)]
*  You know, that... [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7641.28s)]
*  I don't know, not type that. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7643.04s)]
*  That throat singing where it's like, almost like some Mongol shit and they make a Didgeridoo... [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7644.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, here we go. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7648.959999999999s)]
*  It's right in the beginning of this. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7650.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7655.04s)]
*  It's like that monk chant. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7657.839999999999s)]
*  That's what Duncan Trussell does before he goes to sleep. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7659.12s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7664.0s)]
*  This is fucking cool. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7664.96s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty good. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7666.24s)]
*  Bro, I need to see this movie. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7667.28s)]
*  I saw the original one way back in the dis-e. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7671.04s)]
*  I saw the, the, like a long copy of it that doesn't... [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7673.599999999999s)]
*  It was like George C. Scott doing the opening and not... [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7678.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7681.04s)]
*  The one where the girl who plays the princess is doing it is one of the worst. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7682.0s)]
*  She goes, oh, and I forgot one more thing. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7685.599999999999s)]
*  She says that in the opening crawl. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7688.08s)]
*  The plan is called deer. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7692.16s)]
*  It's such a bad cut, but I think this was an Alan Smithy one. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7695.44s)]
*  When I was in art school, my friend Tom had it. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7699.68s)]
*  It was, and it was, it was actually, I liked it a lot. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7701.12s)]
*  Do you think we're sliding into some science fiction movie dystopia? [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7703.68s)]
*  It's just happening slowly and unstoppably. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7707.36s)]
*  I think it happened 20 years ago and you're just slowly learning of it now. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7711.44s)]
*  We're going to wake up one day when things are horrific and that will be our normal existence. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7715.6s)]
*  If we saw that today, we'd be terrified. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7722.4800000000005s)]
*  We'd be terrified of where it's going to be like the Terminator. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7726.0s)]
*  It's going to be like flying drones that know where your location is at all times. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7728.4800000000005s)]
*  To that movie that you showed, that collapse movie, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7732.96s)]
*  which I remember when that came out and how bizarre that is that it's getting like great [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7735.92s)]
*  reviews back then because it was like... [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7739.76s)]
*  Kind of right-wingy. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7742.16s)]
*  Well, that's not right. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7743.76s)]
*  That doesn't even sound right-wing. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7745.12s)]
*  No, it's like anti... [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7746.24s)]
*  That's what they would say now. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7747.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they would say now. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7748.48s)]
*  You think it's bad though the war is really right-wing. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7750.0s)]
*  Like do you even know? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7752.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7753.68s)]
*  So nothing means anything. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7753.76s)]
*  It's all like a label that could be changed at a moment's notice [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7755.36s)]
*  and you're supposed to forget what it meant like two weeks ago. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7758.56s)]
*  The fact that it can be changed at a moment's notice and the fact that you can get people [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7761.84s)]
*  to support war, you can get people to ignore the existence of the military industrial complex [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7765.5199999999995s)]
*  and the amount of money that is involved in that and the influence that that has. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7771.68s)]
*  So that's the worst part of that Jon Stewart thing where he... [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7775.92s)]
*  Because you can see he's like... [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7779.12s)]
*  He's like, I'm not trying to hold your feet if I keep doing that [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7781.52s)]
*  because he wants to get to something. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7784.88s)]
*  And then what he gets to is, okay, I know... [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7786.56s)]
*  Do you think this isn't like cost-effective for our empire? [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7790.240000000001s)]
*  The only appeal he makes to him is maybe we're stretching our empire too thin [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7793.68s)]
*  and is it fiscally... [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7796.96s)]
*  That's all he'll broach the topic with them. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7798.56s)]
*  That's how fucking warped it is. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7800.64s)]
*  But is that... [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7802.160000000001s)]
*  That's the only way you could have that conversation with them? [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7803.04s)]
*  Do they have parameters you think... [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7805.6s)]
*  Yeah, why would they even show up to that? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7807.52s)]
*  Would Jon push that? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7808.88s)]
*  Or would Jon know that this is the way to get access to these people? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7810.400000000001s)]
*  You have to be able to have these kind of interviews with them. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7813.84s)]
*  I would love to know because first of all, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7815.84s)]
*  there's no way he doesn't know by now that that medal he put on the guy [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7817.52s)]
*  that was a guy with a Nazi tattoo. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7821.04s)]
*  Now he probably knows. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7822.72s)]
*  There's no way he doesn't know. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7823.52s)]
*  Yeah, he probably knows now. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7825.12s)]
*  It's just the thing of having faith in the... [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7826.72s)]
*  Let's not give up on this. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7829.36s)]
*  It does not. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7830.72s)]
*  It still works. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7832.400000000001s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7834.32s)]
*  Jon Wenner? [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7834.8s)]
*  The thing where he's like, yeah, the drug supply is really safe. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7837.2s)]
*  He was watching somebody who's like a legendary founder of a thing [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7839.76s)]
*  who's like so like, no, Ben and Jerry are in charge now. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7843.76s)]
*  It's the good people or the establishment. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7849.12s)]
*  It's all being taken care of. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7850.88s)]
*  And they don't read. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7852.08s)]
*  They know people. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7853.2s)]
*  So they just assume it's all... [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7854.400000000001s)]
*  They assume everything is fine because that's what the narrative is. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7856.4800000000005s)]
*  And if you're a good person, you go with the narrative. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7858.72s)]
*  There you go. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7860.72s)]
*  Do you remember when they had the fucking Boston bomber on the cover [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7861.2s)]
*  and they got criticized because he was hot? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7864.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7866.64s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7867.52s)]
*  He had those sweet... [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7868.08s)]
*  Find that photo. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7868.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7869.6s)]
*  He looks like a teen idol. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7870.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7872.08s)]
*  He's a handsome fella. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7872.72s)]
*  The dreamboat terrorist. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7873.92s)]
*  Dreamboat terrorist. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7875.360000000001s)]
*  Not like the meaner older brother with his... [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7876.400000000001s)]
*  Look at him there. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7878.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7880.16s)]
*  No, I mean, he does look like a boy band... [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7881.6s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7883.6s)]
*  He looks like he's some fucking new guy. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7884.48s)]
*  He's the new hot guy the girls have on their wall. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7887.04s)]
*  Were they Chechen? [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7889.36s)]
*  I don't know what he was. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7890.799999999999s)]
*  Because I thought that was something like that. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7892.0s)]
*  Well, that wasn't that long ago, huh? [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7894.48s)]
*  Yeah, because... [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7895.839999999999s)]
*  Terry Clark Jr. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7896.4s)]
*  Remember back when we had no problem with Russia [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7897.599999999999s)]
*  because the Chechens and Muslim terrorists and they cracked down on that? [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7900.48s)]
*  This whole thing is wild. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7905.599999999999s)]
*  But the fact that they found it disgusting and shameful, tasteless, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7907.04s)]
*  a slap in the face to America, [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7911.84s)]
*  Boston public officials have issued similar appraisals, [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7913.360000000001s)]
*  Mayor Thomas Menino called it a total disgrace, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7917.28s)]
*  CVS Walgreens and other local retailers have promised not to sell the issue. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7920.88s)]
*  Wow. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7926.0s)]
*  Well, you gotta admit... [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7926.56s)]
*  But that's just because his face was cute. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7927.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7929.52s)]
*  Scroll back up. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7929.84s)]
*  Imagine if you look like Harvey Weinstein. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7930.8s)]
*  I mean, you tell me he's not way hotter than the FTX kid? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7932.88s)]
*  He's hot. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7936.64s)]
*  They got full page... [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7937.360000000001s)]
*  Look at him. He's a handsome fella. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7938.32s)]
*  I know. I think he didn't do it. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7939.76s)]
*  The more I look at his picture, I don't think he could have with those lips. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7941.44s)]
*  But if his head was shaved and he was ugly, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7947.04s)]
*  would they still have him on the cover? [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7949.839999999999s)]
*  But the thing is, why do they have him on the cover? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7951.12s)]
*  Why take a terrifying, awful situation like that and make the person a star? [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7954.24s)]
*  Well, number one, that's the most important thing is to sell... [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7959.2s)]
*  I bet you sell a bunch of copies of Rolling Stone with that as the cover. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7962.719999999999s)]
*  A dreamy terrorist? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7966.639999999999s)]
*  Would you like to be in the room when they made that call? [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7967.839999999999s)]
*  Do we put the terrorist dreamboat on the cover or Gary Clark Jr.? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7971.679999999999s)]
*  Because Gary Clark Jr. is on the cover too. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7977.04s)]
*  Who's Gary Clark Jr.? [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7978.879999999999s)]
*  He's the baddest motherfucker alive. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7980.0s)]

*  I think Dozer Sorestright Ceratops is more bad than him. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7983.12s)]
*  He's one of the greatest guitarists that's ever lived. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7985.919999999999s)]

*  I saw it at a live club. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=7998.48s)]
*  To this day, one of the greatest musical performances I've ever seen [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8000.32s)]
*  is Gary Clark Jr.'s version of the Allman Brothers' Midnight Rider [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8003.04s)]
*  with Suzanne Santo singing and she doesn't totally know the words, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8007.12s)]
*  so she Googled it and got the fucking lyrics on her phone. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8010.639999999999s)]
*  She's singing perfectly her version of Midnight Rider [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8014.16s)]
*  off of a fucking phone impromptu. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8018.32s)]

*  Yeah, I think Prince went to the real after party or something was what it was. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8175.92s)]
*  There's a real one. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8180.88s)]
*  I had a chance to see Prince once live at the foundation room at the House of Blues in Vegas. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8182.08s)]
*  I decided it was too late. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8191.04s)]

*  Was he walking around? [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8198.32s)]
*  It was at this club and Prince came in. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8199.36s)]
*  Just hanging out? [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8200.88s)]
*  He was real... [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8201.44s)]
*  Because he was a Jehovah's Witness for a minute. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8202.32s)]
*  Prince was? [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8205.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I wanted to ask him all about it, but you can't even get near Prince. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8205.84s)]
*  Christian Scientist is the one that don't let you go to the doctor, right? [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8210.64s)]
*  I'm not really clear. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8214.16s)]
*  I know that was something part of it at one point, but that's... [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8215.119999999999s)]
*  Not Jehovah's Witness? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8217.92s)]
*  No, that's Mary Baker Eddy. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8219.28s)]
*  So was he Jehovah's Witness as a child like you were? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8221.119999999999s)]
*  Or was he late adopter? [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8225.2s)]
*  Yeah, he went door to door. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8227.52s)]
*  Whoa, how old was he? [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8230.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8232.32s)]
*  I feel like Chris Rock had a joke about it or something. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8232.880000000001s)]
*  Somebody had a joke about it, about Prince knocking on your door. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8235.68s)]
*  It was when he was an adult. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8239.44s)]
*  All I'm hearing about Chris Rock is that he's on fire right now. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8241.6s)]
*  Oh, I bet. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8245.92s)]
*  All this getting slapped by Will Smith and the Academy... [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8247.28s)]
*  I think that lit a fire into that dude. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8250.880000000001s)]
*  All I've been hearing. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8252.960000000001s)]
*  I heard he destroyed here in Austin. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8253.76s)]
*  Well, if you watch that recording... [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8255.28s)]
*  Also, right before that... [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8257.28s)]
*  So you know Tim Diller, right? [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8261.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8262.560000000001s)]

*  Okay. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8265.52s)]
*  And after Chris Rock came up and talked to me, he was like, yeah, it was really fun. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8266.480000000001s)]
*  It was like really cool. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8269.6s)]
*  Okay. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8270.400000000001s)]
*  And then he hit me up a couple of weeks later to maybe help write jokes for stuff. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8270.800000000001s)]
*  You know, like, sounds like awesome. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8274.560000000001s)]
*  He was like an awesome guy. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8276.800000000001s)]
*  I talked to him for a couple of hours on the phone. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8278.0s)]
*  We talked. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8279.92s)]
*  And so I was like, I'm going to go. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8280.400000000001s)]
*  And so I didn't know what the timetable... [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8284.96s)]
*  Because he did mention jokes for the Oscars. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8288.32s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8291.279999999999s)]
*  But I don't know when all that stuff is and I'm not good with email. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8291.68s)]
*  So wait, you know... [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8295.199999999999s)]
*  I know where this is going. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8296.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8298.08s)]
*  So it didn't... [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8298.64s)]
*  So I just figured he'd text me, you know, but you know, that's how like Louie read his email. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8300.64s)]
*  And I don't... [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8304.88s)]
*  So I was getting like all this like emails from the guy. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8305.6s)]
*  I'm like, oh, and I'm working on Kyle's thing and like Jimmy's thing. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8308.08s)]
*  I had no concept of when anything was. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8311.84s)]
*  So I had to go do Winnipeg. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8314.32s)]
*  And while I was coming home from Winnipeg, I get a call from my manager. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8316.32s)]
*  She's like, did you write a joke about Will Smith's White? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8321.039999999999s)]
*  Like, and I go, oh, shit, the Oscars was tonight? [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8324.16s)]
*  So you're responsible. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8330.56s)]
*  I like to think I'm not. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8332.88s)]
*  So you wrote the G.I. James? [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8336.08s)]
*  Because I think, no, I think that was an in the moment thing. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8337.2s)]
*  Well, I think I was an in the moment. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8341.28s)]
*  Because when I watch that, I know this is why I would be thinking, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8342.24s)]
*  which it looks to me like Chris Rogers thinking is, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8346.0s)]
*  you know, first of all, this is the worst gig ever being a funny comedian at the Oscars. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8348.48s)]
*  It's a terrible gig. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8352.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8353.44s)]
*  And he's not a big like improv guy. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8354.08s)]
*  Like he likes to do jokes and polish them, you know. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8356.48s)]
*  So Will Smith is coming on stage and you're like, all right, I'm going to have to. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8359.28s)]
*  It's an Oscar moment. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8362.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8363.28s)]
*  So I got to get ready. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8363.92s)]
*  Whatever Will Smith wants to improv. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8364.72s)]
*  I'll bet you up until contact, I bet you he thought it was like a fake. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8366.4s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8370.64s)]
*  I'm sure like that's what I would have thought. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8371.44s)]
*  And I would have been because I don't like to have to do like, [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8373.04s)]
*  like until it hit him, I bet he didn't even realize [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8377.92s)]
*  that it was an actual thing until right when he hit him. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8380.0s)]
*  I think he didn't hit him hard. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8382.640000000001s)]
*  No, but I think he just still shocked. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8385.04s)]
*  I mean, definitely. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8388.24s)]
*  Well, people like, you know, like, why didn't it knock him down? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8389.28s)]
*  I don't think he hit him hard. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8392.16s)]
*  I think he probably wanted to hit him hard then realize when he was about to hit him. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8393.28s)]
*  It's such a it's such a. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8399.52s)]

*  This is a big gig. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8410.08s)]
*  There's nothing worse than now he's feeling it right now is adrenaline spiked. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8411.199999999999s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8415.359999999999s)]
*  Keep my wife's name out of your fucking mouth. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8417.279999999999s)]

*  I mean, think about it, man. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8450.56s)]
*  He probably wanted to be a part of that whole fucking industry thing. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8451.76s)]
*  That's why you host the Oscars in the first place, right? [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8455.36s)]
*  Oh, that's a good point. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8457.44s)]
*  And then get slapped by this guy who winds up winning the Oscar and they give him a [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8458.64s)]
*  fucking standing ovation after you got slapped by that guy. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8462.88s)]
*  Once you cheer and stand up, once you see it, you can't unsee it. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8467.279999999999s)]
*  Can't unsee that. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8471.279999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8472.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8472.56s)]
*  These are crazy people. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8472.88s)]
*  These are crazy people. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8474.16s)]
*  I saw it. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8475.279999999999s)]
*  I remember when what's his name at the Emmys when Jeffrey Tambor won for transparent. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8476.24s)]
*  Remember he got like me too off that show because he was sexually harassing the trans co-stars. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8482.32s)]
*  They were saying that. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8487.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8488.64s)]
*  And I remember. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8488.88s)]
*  So this is before any Caitlyn Jenner. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8489.6s)]
*  He was saying he didn't do anything. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8491.76s)]
*  I mean, I kind of believe I think they wanted him off the show. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8494.24s)]
*  So here's why I think they just want him off the show. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8496.56s)]
*  When because I think Jill Solway is not Jill Solway now, but at the time. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8499.039999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8505.119999999999s)]
*  One one the Emmy. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8505.76s)]
*  I remember she was like fight the patriarchy. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8506.8s)]
*  Sweetie, do you think the patriarchy is not in charge of you? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8511.84s)]
*  Why you have this reminder to let you know who's in charge. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8514.96s)]
*  It's like all sharp. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8518.8s)]
*  If you know, it'll stab you if you. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8519.6s)]
*  So he goes, if I could be the last cis man to play a trans woman, I wouldn't be sad. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8521.52s)]
*  And the whole crowd's like, yeah. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8527.68s)]
*  Like I'm just watching. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8528.88s)]
*  It's like, it's like if Al Jolson was like, if I could be the last blackface performer [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8530.72s)]
*  and they're all like, oh, oh. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8534.8s)]
*  And so just a couple of years later, I'm sure all those people would be like, how dare you have played. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8537.76s)]
*  But they were all rooting for it. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8543.199999999999s)]
*  I don't like I'm happy as I've never even watched the show. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8544.64s)]
*  Probably more. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8547.039999999999s)]
*  Do you know the hardcore feminists are now? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8547.76s)]
*  Will the turfs are now using the term woman face? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8549.76s)]
*  I've been saying that. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8554.800000000001s)]
*  I have a whole joke about that for a while and I've yet to hear why. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8558.16s)]
*  I remember years ago asking somebody a producer when that was Rachel Dolezal. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8562.72s)]
*  Remember? [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8567.84s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8568.32s)]
*  And I was just asking this. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8568.880000000001s)]
*  This was not as big a controversy of a thing at the time. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8571.36s)]
*  But I was like, well, how is that different? [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8575.04s)]
*  You know, because I knew a bunch of people that were trained. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8576.56s)]
*  It was in New York for 20 years. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8578.88s)]
*  It's transracial. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8580.16s)]
*  You know, like I'm just asking why can't you be that? [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8581.279999999999s)]
*  OK, I've never gotten enough. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8584.0s)]
*  Try to find a satisfying answer. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8585.68s)]
*  I've never gotten one. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8587.039999999999s)]
*  But this person I'll never forget. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8588.16s)]
*  I thought about it. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8589.439999999999s)]
*  He goes, Kurt, that's the answer. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8590.16s)]
*  Like, I thought about that for years, dude. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8594.08s)]
*  It's just like, don't do this. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8596.8s)]
*  That's the answer to just asking a question like that. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8599.519999999999s)]
*  And in fact, I would say everything I can't stand in every business is the is that the hill you want to die on? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8602.96s)]
*  I've heard people say that's a good one. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8610.24s)]
*  That's a good one. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8611.52s)]
*  I've heard people say it for years. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8612.24s)]
*  And what the fuck does that mean? [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8613.36s)]
*  That means like you're running for office. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8614.8s)]
*  Do I tell the truth about this now or do I save my political capital for like when it's really important to be honest? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8618.24s)]
*  Like you're right. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8625.28s)]
*  I'm not running for anything. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8625.84s)]
*  I can be honest, whatever the fuck I want. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8626.88s)]
*  But you're supposed to have that. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8629.039999999999s)]
*  Is this the hill? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8630.72s)]
*  Why do I have to die in a hill about? [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8632.08s)]
*  You're asking a question that's a legitimate question. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8636.56s)]
*  But it's a funny thing that there's certain things you're not allowed to question. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8641.119999999999s)]
*  Like, Kanye was right about that part of knowing you shouldn't talk. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8645.039999999999s)]
*  Like I remember in his interview, right? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8648.88s)]
*  When he with Tucker, we did a Kyle did a impression of it. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8651.039999999999s)]
*  Did he? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8655.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8655.52s)]
*  Oh, I did see that the rap when he does the rap thing. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8656.08s)]
*  But one thing, Coney, is a good point is you just trained to know what to not even get into. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8658.8s)]
*  It's not a thing of being afraid of any specific thing. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8664.64s)]
*  Just be afraid. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8666.4s)]
*  Those are the like you're a human AdSense. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8667.439999999999s)]
*  But like, oh, that might not be good for my right around the time when you became a brand. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8672.24s)]
*  I remember it was having a brand. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8677.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah, then you are a brand. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8679.439999999999s)]
*  So you're not even the cow anymore that gets branded. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8681.199999999999s)]
*  You're the fucking brand. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8685.199999999999s)]
*  That's what you are now. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8686.4s)]
*  That's when I know not to talk to a person. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8687.68s)]
*  Yeah, I love what you've done with your brand, Kurt. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8689.68s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8692.08s)]
*  No, no one has ever said that to me once. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8694.16s)]
*  Not once. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8696.64s)]
*  I just did. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8697.44s)]
*  I'm so glad I'm the first. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8698.16s)]
*  No one has ever told me I handled my brand well. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8700.08s)]
*  I've had a dozen people tell me that. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8703.2s)]
*  Well, but okay, that's your brand. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8705.6s)]
*  But what is that? [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8708.56s)]
*  Better than. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8709.12s)]
*  But I mean, but still nonsense. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8709.84s)]
*  Yeah, but that was the first. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8711.92s)]
*  So somebody I bet I could guess their age from if they said I love your brand, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8713.2s)]
*  because there was a time when that was. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8716.72s)]
*  36. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8718.24s)]
*  Yeah, but then it became you are the brand. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8718.88s)]
*  Yes. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8722.48s)]
*  So you wouldn't even think about it and of it belonging to you. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8723.199999999999s)]
*  You're it. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8726.0s)]
*  How do you manage yourself as a brand, Kurt? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8726.48s)]
*  Not well. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8729.279999999999s)]
*  Like three kids on each other's shoulders with a pinch coat trying to get into a dirty movie. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8732.16s)]
*  Gerard told me I looked like that. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8740.8s)]
*  That's a perfect fucking description. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8742.16s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8744.88s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8745.519999999999s)]
*  That's a perfect description. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8747.679999999998s)]
*  She said to me a long time ago. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8749.119999999999s)]
*  And it's that's exactly how I walk downstairs. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8751.439999999999s)]
*  Not an ounce of coordination. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8758.64s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8760.48s)]
*  Yeah, you think there's some creepy as thing to happen where you like. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8762.32s)]
*  So all that you fight people fight, you know, they go is it hurting comedy? [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8766.72s)]
*  Kansas culture is hurting like this. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8769.92s)]
*  Not hurting. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8771.84s)]
*  Comedy is probably the only way you can talk. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8772.56s)]
*  Now it's hurting if you just saying what you think. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8774.16s)]
*  It's one of the few things that you can still talk about ridiculously controversial shit. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8776.8s)]
*  Yeah, that makes jokes. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8781.76s)]
*  It's much worse than it killing comedy. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8784.0s)]
*  It's killing you just speaking your mind. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8785.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8788.0s)]
*  And you like having opinions at the workplace. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8788.64s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=8791.28s)]

*  And it was usually like church people. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9107.92s)]
*  I heard it from a sister and it shows witnesses, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9112.0s)]
*  but I also heard it from kids that were evangelical. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9113.92s)]
*  That Proctor and Gamble, you know, the shampoo. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9117.2s)]
*  Magnates, I guess, went on. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9120.48s)]
*  It was Phil Donahue. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9122.72s)]
*  I've heard other talk shows with Phil Donahue to announce that they worship Satan. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9123.84s)]
*  And that's why they're putting a satanic symbol on the shampoo. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9127.76s)]
*  What? [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9131.44s)]
*  Yeah, and Phil Donahue's like, [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9132.16s)]
*  don't you think Christians are going to be mad? [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9133.12s)]
*  And then they go, there's not enough Christians to stop us. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9134.88s)]
*  I heard that exact thing go around. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9137.44s)]
*  And I was 17 when I heard it. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9140.16s)]
*  It didn't sound... [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9141.92s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't sound plausible to me as a 17-year-old. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9144.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9147.12s)]
*  The company spent decades battling false claims that it was in league with the devil. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9148.0s)]
*  You know what that's like? [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9153.52s)]
*  That's like the rigid gear, gerbil in the ass rumor. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9154.16s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9156.32s)]
*  Just want to cross the line. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9156.8s)]
*  He blamed Stallone for many years. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9157.28s)]
*  Did you know that? [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9159.52s)]
*  No. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9160.32s)]
*  He said Stallone did it. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9161.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was like... [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9163.52s)]
*  Because I would check that news. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9164.32s)]
*  I knew... [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9165.76s)]
*  Him and Stallone were feuding? [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9166.56s)]
*  I think it's like 65 years before the government releases if that happened. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9167.76s)]
*  It's even longer than... [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9172.72s)]
*  Did Sylvester Stallone start the rigid gear, gerbil rumor? [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9173.84s)]
*  An investigation? [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9178.0s)]
*  Oh, they investigated. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9179.04s)]
*  Because that's not even a thing, right? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9181.2s)]
*  People don't actually do that. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9182.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9184.16s)]
*  Do they do that? [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9184.72s)]
*  I'm sure somebody tried after the rumor, but it's... [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9185.28s)]
*  Dude, my buddy Steve worked... [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9188.48s)]
*  He did his residency in Miami in the 1980s during the cocaine days. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9190.56s)]
*  So he did a lot of time in the emergency room. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9194.64s)]
*  He said, we found everything up people's asses. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9196.880000000001s)]
*  G.I. Joe dolls, light bulbs. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9198.960000000001s)]
*  They found light bulbs up the guy's ass. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9200.64s)]
*  Oh yeah, everything. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9202.08s)]
*  Coke bottles, everything. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9203.12s)]
*  Yeah, I used to have a joke about that. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9204.800000000001s)]
*  Humans being the only animal to sometimes stick other animals in their ass. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9206.400000000001s)]
*  That's how you know we're superior. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9211.44s)]
*  We don't have to just eat you. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9214.640000000001s)]
*  We'll use you as a suppository. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9218.0s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9219.6s)]
*  Just for shits and gays. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9220.240000000002s)]
*  I ran out of things to use you for. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9221.04s)]
*  Dan Savage says this is an unverified and persistent urban legend. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9222.640000000001s)]
*  Because once people say a stupid thing like that, though, someone will try it. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9226.720000000001s)]
*  Well, we don't think it's real. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9230.640000000001s)]
*  But what was the root of it? [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9232.24s)]
*  Like who started it? [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9233.52s)]
*  But that wasn't one of those things. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9235.119999999999s)]
*  If you're rich of gear and you walked into a party, people would start making jokes. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9236.16s)]
*  I know, didn't it harm his career, do you think? [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9241.119999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9244.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9246.72s)]
*  I mean, it certainly harmed his reputation if people thought it was real. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9248.4s)]
*  Well, imagine a rumor that spreads across the entire country [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9251.6s)]
*  about you sticking a rat in your ass. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9254.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9256.56s)]
*  No one else. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9257.52s)]
*  Just you. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9258.32s)]
*  I'd be upset. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9258.8s)]
*  I might want to point fingers at Stallone. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9259.76s)]
*  There's no Clint Eastwood rumors of a rat in the ass. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9261.52s)]
*  Here's what we know. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9264.08s)]
*  Gear claims he never had a gerbil in his butt. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9264.880000000001s)]
*  Imagine having to just happen to say that they win. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9270.800000000001s)]
*  Stallone claims he never started the rumor, although we must now investigate his hatred [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9273.52s)]
*  for chicken mustard grease. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9277.68s)]
*  What? [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9278.880000000001s)]
*  What? [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9279.28s)]
*  I missed the first part. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9279.84s)]
*  It said no one can corroborate the definitive start of the rumor, [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9281.6s)]
*  nor the validity of it ever happening, and the world spins badly on. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9284.640000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9289.199999999999s)]
*  But they wouldn't get corrected, those things. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9290.08s)]
*  The Procter & Gamble was so dumb. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9293.6s)]
*  There was no internet. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9296.0s)]
*  It was just word of mouth. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9296.88s)]
*  Oh, that's so crazy. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9298.24s)]
*  If that happens, this Balenciaga thing that I sent you, Jamie? [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9299.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9303.279999999999s)]
*  What is that about? [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9304.08s)]
*  That's probably some guerrilla firm pushing the envelope for Balenciaga. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9305.84s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9310.4s)]
*  Because Balenciaga, they're one of them, like your Coco Chanel, fascist era. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9311.44s)]
*  They're friends with Franco. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9317.279999999999s)]
*  The guy was friends with Franco, Cristobal Balenciaga. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9318.32s)]
*  So, you know, their image, they disavowed Kanye or something. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9321.92s)]
*  Yes. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9328.72s)]
*  And they're like a former Nazi company? [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9329.199999999999s)]
*  Well, they disavowed Kanye and then people started, I guess, looking into them. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9330.72s)]
*  Or maybe coincidentally, at the same time, all this stuff started coming out. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9334.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9337.6s)]
*  I never heard of them. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9338.16s)]
*  I guess that's like a high update. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9339.119999999999s)]
*  It's one of those things you hear about, but I have no interest in purses. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9342.24s)]
*  So I hear about Balenciaga. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9345.52s)]
*  I'm like, OK. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9346.800000000001s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9348.0s)]
*  They make purses? [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9348.48s)]
*  I've seen sunglasses. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9349.6s)]
*  What do they make, Jamie? [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9351.44s)]
*  It's like high-end fancy shit. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9352.960000000001s)]
*  That shit doesn't mean anything to me. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9355.52s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9357.84s)]
*  I hear about that. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9358.4s)]
*  I'm like, OK. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9358.640000000001s)]
*  It's like you want a game of Go. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9359.6s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9361.2s)]
*  I'm sure you're smart. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9362.48s)]
*  When I went to China, I didn't see anything that looked like communism there. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9363.28s)]
*  I saw almost an 80s movie, kind of hyper, like that, you know, like name-brand. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9368.960000000001s)]
*  A lot of counterfeit stuff. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9375.119999999999s)]
*  So I'm in a hotel. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9376.24s)]
*  I say I ate nothing. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9377.439999999999s)]
*  I had a hard time finding Chinese stuff. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9379.439999999999s)]
*  What did you eat? [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9381.599999999999s)]
*  Like hotel food? [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9382.8s)]
*  Yeah, very, by the way, very well done. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9384.16s)]
*  I don't mean cooked well done. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9387.119999999999s)]
*  I mean good food. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9388.08s)]
*  It was very good, but I had. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9389.759999999998s)]
*  So it was like it wasn't expensive at the time. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9391.519999999999s)]
*  It was like in 2016 before the election. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9393.839999999998s)]
*  And they were kind of into Trump, the people that I talked to at the time. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9396.96s)]
*  Really? [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9399.599999999999s)]
*  They're like, he's a businessman, so he's good. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9400.24s)]
*  See, it was like very like that when I was there. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9401.92s)]
*  And this girl in front of me had on this jacket with like a price tag hanging off the back. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9404.0s)]
*  And I remember what it's like something thousands of probably do you want juan. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9408.800000000001s)]
*  And I put it hanging off the back of the jacket to let everybody know how much it cost. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9413.68s)]
*  It was such a big price tag. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9417.12s)]
*  It looked like remember Minnie Pearl from he haul with the hat. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9418.48s)]
*  It was like that. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9421.52s)]
*  And the jacket was an Ed Hardy jean jacket that was clearly not made by. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9423.44s)]
*  So it's clearly a knockoff. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9428.08s)]
*  And when I went there, they used to have this cool black market around Shanghai where you [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9429.6s)]
*  could find like what I wish I could have got was the Nike Nike Reeboks. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9433.12s)]
*  There's a you had sneakers that said both Nike and Reebok on them. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9438.720000000001s)]
*  But that was all over with by the time I got there. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9443.92s)]
*  But they still have entire stores over there that are Apple stores [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9446.0s)]
*  that are not really Apple stores. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9450.320000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9452.160000000002s)]
*  Everything in there is counterfeit. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9452.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because I think I view IPs differently than here. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9454.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they don't at all. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9457.68s)]
*  They're like tough shit. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9458.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I understand why I wouldn't do this thing. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9459.92s)]
*  Well, it's like the scooping up of intellectual information. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9465.28s)]
*  What they do with like that's why Huawei got banned in the United States because they think [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9470.0s)]
*  they're using their routers to scoop up information. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9474.8s)]
*  So if you're creating something, you're in some company. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9477.68s)]
*  Chinese authorities shut down elaborate fake Apple service. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9480.0s)]
*  That is very elaborate because that does not. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9482.960000000001s)]
*  The last story I could find 2018. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9485.28s)]
*  Most of them are saying there's just there's a few of them around. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9486.88s)]
*  And then this is they shut it down. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9489.52s)]
*  Oh, they shut it down. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9490.800000000001s)]
*  Well, it makes sense because Apple probably has a nice tidy business deal with them over there. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9492.08s)]
*  Dude, in L.A., I can't believe they don't shut down every weed store [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9496.24s)]
*  that looks like an Apple store for some reason. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9499.92s)]
*  There's like screens. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9502.720000000001s)]
*  I know you buy weed with a tablet on a nice oak table. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9504.880000000001s)]
*  Is this why the weed costs more than illegal now? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9509.6s)]
*  It's a lot more. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9512.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I'll pay. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9513.84s)]
*  I'll pay. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9515.6s)]
*  Just make look the amount of money that you actually spend on weed, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9516.24s)]
*  even if weed is more than it is now in comparison to alcohol, it's not even comparable. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9520.32s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9525.039999999999s)]
*  Especially if you like to drink expensive shit like Claas Azul tequila or something or [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9526.48s)]
*  some old scotch. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9533.199999999999s)]
*  That's it's really expensive. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9534.08s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9535.44s)]
*  Like 50 bucks. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9535.84s)]
*  How many drinks can you get? [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9537.119999999999s)]
*  How you get with 50 bucks? [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9539.119999999999s)]
*  Have you seen those like thousand dollar joints? [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9540.8s)]
*  Speaking of joints, you ever see that with our joints? [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9542.96s)]
*  I'll see videos pop up online where it'll be like, [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9546.64s)]
*  I can't remember who it was with some rapper and they were showing him [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9549.52s)]
*  joints that were like 40,000. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9552.56s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9554.0s)]
*  What? [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9554.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9555.119999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about, Jamie? [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9556.16s)]
*  Yeah, two chains does this here. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9557.36s)]
*  Oh, that's what it was. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9558.48s)]
*  It was two chains. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9559.28s)]
*  24,000 dollar joint. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9560.64s)]
*  The most expensive. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9562.16s)]
*  That's pretty big though, actually. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9564.08s)]
*  Oh, is it made with gold? [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9565.119999999999s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9566.24s)]
*  It's definitely wrapped in gold. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9566.72s)]
*  Oh, so you're smoking gold. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9568.32s)]
*  That's good for you, probably. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9569.68s)]
*  For a good cause, though. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9574.48s)]
*  He created that weed for a good cause. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9575.52s)]
*  What was the cause? [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9577.2s)]
*  To get fucked up. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9578.08s)]
*  And then they donate the money to the African Wildlife Foundation. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9580.16s)]
*  Doesn't mining the gold for the rapper probably harm wildlife more than... [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9583.28s)]
*  This is separate from that one. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9588.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, what is that one? [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9590.0s)]
*  Actually, the one he smoked was 50K. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9591.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9593.68s)]
*  And I don't know why. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9594.640000000001s)]
*  So look at this. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9595.28s)]
*  He's going to open it up. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9595.84s)]
*  Luxury. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9597.68s)]
*  Those are 50K? [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9598.720000000001s)]
*  Those coronas? [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9600.960000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9602.640000000001s)]
*  What? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9603.68s)]
*  I'm sure they explain why, but it might not make sense. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9604.32s)]
*  Oh, it's 420 bucks. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9606.4s)]
*  That's all. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9607.44s)]
*  12 grams of flour. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9608.64s)]
*  There's probably they build up to one that's 50K. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9609.84s)]
*  I like how the real potheads call it flour. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9612.24s)]
*  12 grams of flour. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9614.56s)]
*  Oh, I know that really. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9615.6s)]
*  I remember being like, I'm not calling it cannabis. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9616.48s)]
*  It used to be a thing like a guy with a ponytail would say to you. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9618.56s)]
*  Plant medicine. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9622.48s)]
*  It's plant medicine, man. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9624.32s)]
*  I'm harvesting the cannabis. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9625.52s)]
*  I'm getting all my flowers. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9627.039999999999s)]
*  But I'll tell you what's great about California is you [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9631.44s)]
*  always meet somebody, somebody cool person that grows a lot. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9633.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9636.560000000001s)]
*  It just hooks me up. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9636.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9637.68s)]
*  There's a lot of good growers. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9639.84s)]
*  But that's the thing about the cannabis business. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9642.560000000001s)]
*  A lot of fucking really cool people involved in the cannabis business [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9645.12s)]
*  because they're selling cannabis. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9648.720000000001s)]
*  So they're getting high all the time. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9650.24s)]
*  So they're really kind of cool and passionate. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9651.44s)]
*  Well, a good friend of mine, I won't say, but back in New York who ended up having a [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9653.52s)]
*  pretty good cannabis business. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9659.6s)]
*  And there was something like he was working with the state government on the down low [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9661.68s)]
*  because to say about legal, you know, they work with people. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9665.76s)]
*  New York has all those deliveries and that delivery of weed scene was pretty [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9668.720000000001s)]
*  surprisingly violent to me of like bicycle guys like that was at HBO show, [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9674.160000000002s)]
*  high maintenance about a guy delivers weed on his bike. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9679.2s)]
*  Half baked was all about that. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9682.640000000001s)]
*  The delivery like he had to get a friend to be his bodyguard and stuff that people get stabbed. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9683.84s)]
*  And I remember going like, wow, there's all that over we'd. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9690.24s)]
*  He goes, no, it's over money. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9692.32s)]
*  Of course. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9694.56s)]
*  I didn't even just weed, man. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9695.68s)]
*  You remember when Denver made it legal, but then they couldn't do business with credit cards [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9697.68s)]
*  because banks didn't want to do business with them. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9704.16s)]
*  So they had to do business and cash. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9706.16s)]
*  And then they had to take the cash and they had multiple times a day [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9708.4s)]
*  drive with the cash to the bank. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9712.64s)]
*  So they hired like seals and like mercenaries to fucking ride with them. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9714.4s)]
*  And these banks, by the way, were later caught taking cartel money for much worse drugs. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9719.92s)]
*  I mean, every single thing, all the Epstein. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9726.08s)]
*  Well, they took the money, I think. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9727.92s)]
*  But they wouldn't do business with credit cards. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9729.359999999999s)]
*  Credit card companies wouldn't do business with it. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9731.6s)]
*  The nerve of a credit card. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9733.359999999999s)]
*  I think the idea is that federally, it's still illegal. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9735.039999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9738.16s)]
*  I think they relax that now. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9738.64s)]
*  Find out if you can wait. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9741.119999999999s)]
*  That probably makes legal sense, though, because if you could get busted any minute. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9742.08s)]
*  Everywhere I've been, the way that if you use a card, it's still doing some weird [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9746.32s)]
*  thing where it's you're paying somebody else and then they're paying them. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9750.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9754.16s)]
*  Yeah, because I bet I mean, you're paying somebody else. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9755.039999999999s)]
*  They do some weird transaction where like you pay five dollars extra and [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9757.12s)]
*  they accept you touch the number and whatever the fuck. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9760.48s)]
*  What are we doing? [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9763.28s)]
*  It's twenty twenty two. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9763.92s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9764.88s)]
*  Just tax it. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9765.68s)]
*  In fact, I used to say that now I'm like, maybe let's make sure you know what you're [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9767.76s)]
*  California's has completely fucked that up. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9771.68s)]
*  Do you know how the illegal market is now? [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9773.92s)]
*  I guess like bigger than the legal market, which is surprising to me. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9776.48s)]
*  Well, because it's it's also a misdemeanor. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9780.24s)]
*  I had this guy, John Norris, who wrote this book about it's called Hidden War. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9782.880000000001s)]
*  It's about how their cartels are growing weed on public forestry. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9790.720000000001s)]
*  They go to public forest land like in the fucking California mountains and shit. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9795.44s)]
*  And they set up these grow ops and they grow weed and they stay there and they camp there. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9800.08s)]
*  And they're using these fucking like seriously dangerous pesticides and herbicides and shit [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9803.68s)]
*  gets in the water supply. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9809.52s)]
*  Well, you know, they're also like to even go into business. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9811.2s)]
*  The way it's I think all these places when they legalize it want to have like a monopoly [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9816.32s)]
*  that's in cozy with like whatever politician is putting it through because they make it hard. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9820.72s)]
*  You have to have like half an illegal grow to support your legal grow because you have [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9824.96s)]
*  to have so many, I don't know, power, however they measure it to legally be able to do it. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9829.52s)]
*  And it's it's made that way on purpose to make sure it's like only like a real big money [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9834.24s)]
*  place can do it. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9839.76s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what you mean. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9840.4s)]
*  Like there's a whole vice thing about they had something for prisoners in L.A. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9841.6s)]
*  Like it's like, you know, black prisoners released from the drug war stuff where they [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9844.880000000001s)]
*  get first dibs on getting licensed to grow. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9849.76s)]
*  And and so I mean, if you got caught, [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9853.44s)]
*  imagine getting arrested for something and then you get first dibs on license to grow [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9855.36s)]
*  legally. What the fuck did you arrest me for? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9859.36s)]
*  They should get that, by the way. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9861.44s)]
*  I don't have any vision with that, but guess what? [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9863.12s)]
*  They can't get it. It's even fucked up for them. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9864.960000000001s)]
*  It's so they just fucked it up. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9867.04s)]
*  California stinks, dude. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9869.36s)]
*  They can't, you know, I don't like kids or a house there or anything. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9870.640000000001s)]
*  So I don't know what the hell like there's a lot of regulations. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9874.880000000001s)]
*  That's for sure. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9879.2s)]
*  It's but there's so much money from that legal cannabis. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9880.08s)]
*  Like how much good is that done? [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9884.24s)]
*  I mean, what is that? [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9886.480000000001s)]
*  I'd like to know, like, what's the benefit? [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9887.28s)]
*  What's the cost benefit for the state for having it legal? [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9888.88s)]
*  Like how much? I mean, California must make a lot of money. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9892.32s)]
*  Where does it all go? [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9894.72s)]
*  They're taxing the shit out of it. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9895.519999999999s)]
*  What's the annual amount of money marijuana brings in and tax? [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9896.96s)]
*  20 to 2021 fiscal year, California collected about eight hundred and seventeen million dollars. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9901.359999999999s)]
*  I like the homeless. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9907.92s)]
*  That's a good chunk. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9909.679999999998s)]
*  But what is that? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9911.199999999999s)]
*  I don't think that includes the local taxes. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9912.16s)]
*  Oh, different, too. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9914.08s)]
*  And then there's like an excise tax. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9915.199999999999s)]
*  I have no idea what that is. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9916.64s)]
*  Three taxes on it. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9918.0s)]
*  Oh, which is why there's a bunch of articles. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9919.28s)]
*  I can't get past the paywall to see it right now. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9921.04s)]
*  I'm trying to that's saying exactly what he's saying that the illegal market over the last year [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9922.720000000001s)]
*  has jumped up a bunch because of that. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9926.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because you tax the shit out of it. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9929.44s)]
*  Well, they don't, you know, the homeless. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9931.28s)]
*  What I was getting at, though, let me finish that before I forget. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9934.24s)]
*  The reason why the cartels grow on forest land is because it's legal here. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9937.04s)]
*  It's just a misdemeanor. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9941.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9942.800000000001s)]
*  So if you're growing illegally, it's not like a gigantic penalty. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9944.24s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9948.96s)]
*  Make sure that's true. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9949.44s)]
*  I know that was true at one point in time. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9950.8s)]
*  But if you're caught growing marijuana illegally in California, it's a misdemeanor. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9952.56s)]
*  You're causing a stampede at the border right now. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9957.76s)]
*  I think but I think that's I think they're so lenient about it because it is legal to [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9960.0s)]
*  grow it in the state. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9964.16s)]
*  And so there's some weird fucking reason why they decided to do it there. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9965.28s)]
*  I think he said something like 90 percent of the illegal weed. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9969.68s)]
*  You can grow up to six plants, but the law makes it a misdemeanor if you grow an excess [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9972.64s)]
*  of that. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9976.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9977.119999999999s)]
*  So that's that's illegal cultivation of marijuana, although adults 21 and older are now permitted [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9977.68s)]
*  to grow up to six plants. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9984.56s)]
*  So if you grow more than six plants, the law makes it a misdemeanor offense. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9986.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9990.24s)]
*  The conviction is punishable by six months in jail. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9991.279999999999s)]
*  That ain't shit. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9993.359999999999s)]
*  So if you're you're making fucking bang for the cartel, they catch you and you're like [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9994.72s)]
*  jokes on you, pal. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=9999.279999999999s)]
*  I'm not even from here. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10000.08s)]
*  So he had to develop like a tactical force to deal with these people because they're [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10001.36s)]
*  getting shot at. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10005.92s)]
*  So who did John Norris, this guy that wrote that book, he signed up to be a game warden. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10007.12s)]
*  He liked going outdoors, doing some fishing. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10012.880000000001s)]
*  He'd be like, be good to be a game warden. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10015.28s)]
*  You go, you check people's licenses. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10017.12s)]
*  How you doing, sir? [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10018.720000000001s)]
*  Make sure everybody's up to regulation. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10019.6s)]
*  Good job. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10021.44s)]
*  You're in the outdoors. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10021.92s)]
*  You see a big foot. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10022.720000000001s)]
*  And then they started finding things like creeks that were dried up. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10023.6s)]
*  And they're like, why is this creek dried up? [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10026.640000000001s)]
*  We'll chase it down. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10028.08s)]
*  They go up to the top of the creek thinking that like maybe a beaver did something or [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10028.96s)]
*  a farmer did something. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10032.32s)]
*  And then they found these tubes that diverted all the water to this illegal grow up. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10033.599999999999s)]
*  And they go there and these people are using all these toxic chemicals. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10038.24s)]
*  One of the guys' dogs got shot. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10042.56s)]
*  Like, it's crazy shit. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10045.519999999999s)]
*  Like, they're having gunfights with these people in the middle of the fucking forest [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10046.8s)]
*  because these are just cartel guys. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10050.16s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10051.839999999998s)]
*  So they basically developed like a tactical unit. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10052.4s)]
*  So he went from being a game warden. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10055.519999999999s)]
*  I'm going to check people's fishing licenses. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10057.36s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10058.720000000001s)]
*  To being a guy who's like in a shootout with a cartel in the woods. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10059.2s)]
*  It's really wild. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10062.960000000001s)]
*  Wild. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10064.08s)]
*  And it's because it's a misdemeanor. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10064.560000000001s)]
*  So because it's a misdemeanor to grow a bunch of plants illegally, [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10066.0s)]
*  they just fucking grow anywhere they want. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10069.6s)]
*  So federally now, because you know that bullshit, [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10071.84s)]
*  like this is an important first step that Biden did. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10075.76s)]
*  They didn't do anything. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10079.68s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10080.480000000001s)]
*  I thought it was good too. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10081.36s)]
*  And then I looked into it. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10082.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, did you see what it is? [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10083.44s)]
*  Nobody in jail for nobody's in federal prison for marijuana possession. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10084.32s)]
*  Well, you don't get pulled over by the FBI [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10088.24s)]
*  and busted for simple marijuana possession. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10090.16s)]
*  You haven't had that problem. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10093.92s)]
*  Marijuana possession is not that big of a crime. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10096.0s)]
*  It's dealers and growers that get big sentences and they're not letting them out. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10098.96s)]
*  That's the difference. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10104.4s)]
*  First of all, it should be fucking legal. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10106.56s)]
*  We're not babies. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10109.119999999999s)]
*  Why isn't it though? [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10110.56s)]
*  It's because people paying to keep it illegal. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10111.52s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10113.68s)]
*  We should demand the legality of it. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10114.880000000001s)]
*  It's a human rights issue. [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10117.6s)]
*  You should have access to it. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10119.68s)]
*  You could demand all you want. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10121.04s)]
*  It has benefits to a lot of people that use it. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10122.64s)]
*  It's real benefits that people enjoy. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10125.52s)]
*  And people that don't enjoy those benefits are telling you not to do it. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10127.92s)]
*  Because if they did enjoy those benefits, [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10130.800000000001s)]
*  they would never tell you you shouldn't do it. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10132.4s)]
*  Oh, I think a lot of them do. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10134.24s)]
*  It's just they enjoy the... [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10136.32s)]
*  They've calculated what profit loss there is. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10138.24s)]
*  That's why all the lobbyists to keep it illegal. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10140.800000000001s)]
*  Do you ever look up the lobbies? [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10143.28s)]
*  Hilarious. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10145.04s)]
*  What are they? [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10145.84s)]
*  It's like pharmaceutical companies, of course, and alcohol companies. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10146.880000000001s)]
*  Because they're like, we get regulated. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10151.28s)]
*  They're just going to make another drug and not... [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10152.720000000001s)]
*  Some police union, I think? [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10155.68s)]
*  The private prison lobby. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10157.68s)]
*  I've heard that. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10159.68s)]
*  I've heard private prison guards unions. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10160.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you got to keep them full. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10163.2s)]
*  But they're just... [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10165.92s)]
*  They're using human beings in their lives like a battery to generate money. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10166.480000000001s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10171.36s)]
*  Yeah, no shit. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10172.16s)]
*  No reason whatsoever that you should be able to tell a person [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10173.919999999998s)]
*  that you can get drunk, but you can't get high. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10176.88s)]

*  Do you know... [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10181.039999999999s)]
*  I just found this out. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10182.24s)]
*  I mean, it makes me laugh. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10183.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's a terrible story. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10184.4s)]
*  But you ever hear the last slave legally freed in America is 1942? [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10185.919999999998s)]
*  What? [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10190.72s)]
*  Yeah, a guy's name is Irving something or something Irving. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10191.199999999999s)]
*  They used to have a thing, debt peonage, [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10196.08s)]
*  where you get busted for some dumb charge like vagrancy or something [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10198.4s)]
*  for $75, and then a guy's like, [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10202.32s)]
*  I'll pay your fine and you can come and work on my plantation. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10204.24s)]
*  They lock you up like a slave and you can't... [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10208.08s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10210.48s)]
*  And so then they finally, I think a white guy... [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10213.76s)]
*  Because then it wasn't limited to black people. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10215.68s)]
*  If you're like a... [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10217.68s)]
*  Some kid was visiting down south and got caught up in it and died. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10218.64s)]
*  I think that's why it made the papers, this debt peonage thing. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10222.4s)]
*  And their defense in court was, no, we're not doing debt peonage. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10225.44s)]
*  We have slaves. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10228.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10231.119999999999s)]
*  Prosecute them. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10232.16s)]
*  And they didn't stop it until like 1942 after Pearl Harbor because the Japanese... [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10233.52s)]
*  And this is in the newspapers. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10238.4s)]
*  The Japanese are using it as propaganda that we still have... [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10239.84s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10243.04s)]
*  Yeah. It's just like a hilarious... [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10243.84s)]
*  To use that as your defense and that's how you get out of it. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10247.84s)]
*  That's an amazing... [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10250.16s)]
*  So you could go when a person was locked up and offered to buy them out. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10251.36s)]
*  They would have to work it off. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10257.12s)]
*  You always hear about slavery and Jim Crow. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10259.12s)]
*  They would be able to decide how much you got paid? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10260.56s)]
*  That's how we got all these... [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10263.519999999999s)]
*  We're talking about is there a quota. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10264.72s)]
*  All this shit grew out of that. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10267.68s)]
*  In some of these places, it's all inertia. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10270.8s)]
*  In Texas, I don't know how big... [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10273.6s)]
*  Maybe it's bigger news in the state, but I was trying to figure out... [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10275.6s)]
*  Sounds like all this prison labor, if you think illegal immigration is lowering wages, [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10279.92s)]
*  I bet all the prison labor lowers wages a lot, right? [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10284.48s)]
*  So I go to look it up. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10288.08s)]
*  And then here in Texas, it's not even profitable. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10289.52s)]
*  They have people picking cotton. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10293.2s)]
*  It's not even better than just not having that, but they just had it for so long. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10295.92s)]
*  So they have slaves pick cotton here in Texas? [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10302.16s)]
*  If I'm saying this right. [[02:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10306.48s)]
*  So it's in the 13th Amendment. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10307.28s)]
*  State property, when you're a prisoner, you're a slave. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10309.92s)]
*  That's written into... [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10311.92s)]
*  Well, I know they can use you for wildfires, right? [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10313.76s)]
*  Slave means your property, right? [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10316.4s)]
*  That's what it means. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10317.76s)]
*  It's not like you had to work for a low-wage... [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10318.4s)]
*  Your state property, that's what you're called as a prisoner. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10320.24s)]
*  And that's why they may have the amendment to free the slaves, but that's in there still. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10323.119999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10328.8s)]
*  When it comes to things like fighting wildfires, do they have any say whether or not they fight [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10330.64s)]
*  a wildfire? [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10335.119999999999s)]
*  Because they use them sometimes as cheap labor. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10336.48s)]
*  So do you think they get to choose whether or not they do it? [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10339.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure if I'm in prison, I probably would want to get out of it. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10342.08s)]
*  That's one of the things that Tulsi Gabbard, during that big debate moment with Kamala Harris... [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10347.52s)]
*  You had those guys on talking about that? [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10352.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10353.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10354.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10354.800000000001s)]
*  She doesn't want to disrupt the prison labor, so she doesn't release... [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10356.32s)]
*  The federal government says you got to release these people. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10359.44s)]
*  Well, she used them to fight wildfires. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10361.92s)]
*  But the thing is, what does that mean? [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10364.880000000001s)]
*  Do you give them an option? [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10367.76s)]
*  Do you just tell them they have to fight a wildfire no matter what? [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10370.4s)]
*  Prisoners who want to enter the conservation camp program must meet security requirements [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10373.84s)]
*  and undergo two weeks of training. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10378.960000000001s)]
*  The all-inmate crews live in so-called fire camps and are led by personnel from the California [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10381.36s)]
*  Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL FIRE. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10388.64s)]
*  They earn between $2.90 and $5 a day, depending on their dues. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10391.6s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10397.68s)]
*  I bet they got... [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10398.4s)]
*  Slightly more when actively fighting a fire. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10399.04s)]
*  Slightly more. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10401.68s)]
*  I'm going to give you a bump to... [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10402.48s)]
*  There's some upsell potential. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10403.6s)]
*  310 and 520 when fighting a fire. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10404.4s)]
*  Though their numbers have fluctuated over the years, they have often compromised approximately [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10408.56s)]
*  one-third of California's firefighting force. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10412.720000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10414.960000000001s)]
*  So to put it on in a positive spin, is it possible that it's one of those things, like [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10415.92s)]
*  if you're a specialist in times of war and they need to make you work, they need to redraft you? [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10423.12s)]
*  We need you for this very specific thing. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10430.56s)]
*  You signed up to be the property. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10431.68s)]
*  If you signed up to be a part of this crew when you were trained and then a wildfire [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10433.36s)]
*  broke out, maybe it was part of the agreement when you signed up that if some shit hit the fan, [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10438.400000000001s)]
*  they were allowed to keep you longer because you were very difficult to train. [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10444.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I've seen the dirty dozen. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10454.32s)]
*  I know how that works. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10456.16s)]
*  I'm just... [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10459.04s)]
*  You could also sign up for medical experimentation. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10460.480000000001s)]
*  Britain sucks. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10462.88s)]
*  I bet I would go fight a forest fire if I was in the California penal system. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10465.199999999999s)]
*  You have to choose between experimental medications and fighting a forest fire. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10468.72s)]
*  Dude, maybe the forest fire because I've experimented with many medications. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10475.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but on your own free will. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10481.839999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and if they're like, hey, okay, we don't want to use it. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10483.519999999999s)]
*  Lab rats aren't enough, but we can't use it on the people that aren't owned by this state. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10487.599999999999s)]
*  We're going to see prisoners first. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10492.56s)]
*  Those are the ones you probably never want to be in the test for. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10495.279999999999s)]
*  The ones they take to prisoners is my guess. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10497.92s)]
*  It's not great when you see their process with non-prisoners testing. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10503.119999999999s)]
*  I bet it's really not good when they could do whatever they want. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10507.119999999999s)]
*  Especially if you're a piece of shit. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10511.92s)]
*  I mean, that's the premise of so many horror movies. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10514.32s)]
*  You got a bunch of fucking murderers sitting around, a bunch of horrible people. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10516.24s)]
*  Thieves. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10522.64s)]
*  Plus, I imagine our amazing system really improves. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10523.68s)]
*  Yeah. If you got a guy who's killed a bunch of women, [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10527.92s)]
*  why wouldn't you practice some shit on him? [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10532.4s)]
*  Get some serial killer guy in there. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10535.76s)]
*  Give him the fucking, see what happens with full dose. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10537.68s)]
*  It's a premise of a lot of video games and very good movies. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10541.119999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10545.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, manhunt. Remember that rock star game, manhunt? [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10546.0s)]
*  You know that whole CIA connection to Charles Manson happened when he was in prison. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10548.64s)]
*  Did you see, oh, who's the guy who played Machete? Danny Trejo, that actor? [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10555.68s)]
*  No. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10560.8s)]
*  You know who he is, right? [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10561.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, sure, sure. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10562.0s)]
*  I saw him telling a story about being in the joint with Charles Manson. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10562.8s)]
*  He said he was this little ratty guy that had a rope for a belt, [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10566.48s)]
*  but he could hypnotize you to feel like you were on heroin. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10569.6s)]
*  But the only thing is you had to have done heroin before. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10573.119999999999s)]
*  So his one friend, it wouldn't work on him, but him and his buddy, [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10576.08s)]
*  he said, the guy hypnotized him and they threw up and got high. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10578.640000000001s)]
*  And I happen to see you have that author on here and then saw that Danny Trejo. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10584.08s)]
*  That's a weird story. He could hypnotize you to feel like you were high on heroin. [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10587.76s)]
*  This is before all that stuff. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10592.08s)]
*  Tom O'Neill, who wrote the book Chaos, which is a fucking amazing book all about this. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10593.68s)]
*  He went deep down the rabbit hole for 20 years writing this book. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10599.68s)]
*  It's meticulously researched. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10603.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. I saw that interview. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10604.72s)]
*  The CIA 100% did these drug experiments for people in the 1960s. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10606.88s)]
*  It was the 1950s as well. When did it start? [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10612.88s)]
*  But they did it. It's like documented. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10615.76s)]
*  Well, it was good of them to come forward and admit to it and move on from there. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10617.84s)]
*  They did these things where they would dose johns and brothels. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10621.199999999999s)]
*  So these guys would go to a whorehouse looking to hook up with some ladies. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10625.679999999998s)]
*  That's the psychedelic, what's it called again? MK Ultra. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10628.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same thing. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10631.84s)]
*  Manson was first talked the group into thinking they were smoking weed and then heroin. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10634.24s)]
*  By the time he described in my bloodstream, [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10640.640000000001s)]
*  I felt the warmth flowing through my body. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10644.0s)]
*  If that white boy wasn't a career criminal, he could have been a professional hypnotist. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10648.16s)]
*  That's wild, dude. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10652.720000000001s)]
*  So he hypnotized them into feeling like they were doing heroin. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10653.84s)]
*  Have you ever been hypnotized? [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10656.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I have been. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10658.16s)]
*  I think they probably taught him how to do that. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10659.44s)]
*  I think that was part of the... The book doesn't say for a fact this is what they did, [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10662.56s)]
*  but what it does is point a lot of evidence to the fact that this guy, [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10670.4s)]
*  who was the head of MK Ultra, Jolly West, definitely visited Manson in prison. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10674.72s)]
*  Manson had access to LSD. When he would get arrested, he would get released. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10679.76s)]
*  They would say it was above their pay grade. All points indicate that he was like... [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10683.6s)]
*  Oh, that classic... [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10687.119999999999s)]
*  He was taught how to take these people and lead them, and that he was taught how to do it with [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10688.64s)]
*  LSD, and that he was supplied LSD. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10694.4s)]
*  That was creepy him talking about that. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10696.64s)]
*  It's crazy because once you know that they definitely did experiments on people with LSD, [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10698.8s)]
*  100% did that. So then you got to go, well, how many people and what was the extent of this? [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10705.12s)]
*  When did they end this? How much did it affect of culture? How much did it affect of people going [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10709.84s)]
*  fucking nuts and jumping off buildings? What exactly happened? [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10715.6s)]
*  Did you ever see the thing about the gay bomb in the 90s? [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10721.12s)]
*  Oh, that's right. That's right. They were thinking of coming up with a bomb [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10726.24s)]
*  that they could drop on a city and make everybody gay. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10730.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds so crazy, but it is a real thing. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10734.24s)]
*  In 1994, the US military actually considered building a gay bomb. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10739.36s)]
*  It was to debilitate... [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10744.56s)]
*  This could be a great South Park movie. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10746.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, you just told me in the beginning it was about a guy that successfully sued because [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10748.880000000001s)]
*  he became gay and gambling. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10752.4s)]
*  So we know it's possible to do this. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10758.64s)]
*  Researchers at the Wright Laboratory in Ohio, a predecessor to today's United States Air Force [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10761.2s)]
*  Research Laboratory, began exploring some alternative options. What existed, they asked, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10767.36s)]
*  that would distract or delude a soldier long enough to mount an attack without causing the [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10772.72s)]
*  soldier any bodily harm? The answer seemed obvious, sex. But how could the Air Force [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10778.96s)]
*  make that work to their advantage? In an act of brilliance or insanity, they came up with [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10784.56s)]
*  the perfect plan. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10788.88s)]
*  Wait, is that really true? All soldiers one weakness? [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10790.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10797.199999999999s)]
*  Pheromones. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10798.24s)]
*  They put together a three page proposal in which they detailed their $7.5 million invention, [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10799.76s)]
*  the gay bomb. The gay bomb would be a cloud of gas that would discharge over enemy camps [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10807.12s)]
*  that contained a chemical that would cause enemy soldiers to become gay and to have their units [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10814.08s)]
*  break down because all their soldiers became irresistibly attractive to one another. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10819.92s)]
*  Dude, that would be a great series. Like somebody, you get to use all the failed, [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10825.599999999999s)]
*  like you have access to all the kind of embarrassing things that they worked on. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10833.039999999999s)]
*  How funny is the way they look at gay people? They think that if everybody just became gay, [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10839.439999999999s)]
*  they would just totally be distracted about this whole war thing and just wanna fuck. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10844.8s)]
*  They didn't start with gay, they go, what's the way to distract soldiers? And they're like, [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10849.519999999999s)]
*  sex. So are you telling me all soldiers could just be distracted by sex at any moment? [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10852.64s)]
*  Even in the middle of a firefight. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10857.92s)]
*  In the middle of a firefight. I was just so focused. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10859.519999999999s)]
*  Is that how we lost Vietnam? [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10866.8s)]
*  Among the more comical ideas was a bomb titled Who Me, which simulated flatulence among the ranks, [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10869.119999999999s)]
*  hopefully distracting the soldiers with terrible smells long enough for the U.S. to attack. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10876.72s)]
*  A fart bomb! The idea was scrapped almost immediately, however, after researchers [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10883.119999999999s)]
*  pointed out that some people throughout the world don't find the smell of flatulence [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10887.92s)]
*  particularly offensive. That's racist. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10891.92s)]
*  That's hilarious. Oh my God. [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10893.84s)]
*  So they didn't get to work making this. They're just blue sky in this thing. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10897.439999999999s)]
*  This is like a sketch show. What about a gay bomb? [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10904.72s)]
*  They wanted a bomb to make wasps sting people until they would stop. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10907.76s)]
*  Wasps? Wow. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10913.2s)]
*  Make their skin subtly and unambiguously sensitive to the sun. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10914.400000000001s)]
*  Who was the guy that wrote for Hollywood Squares for Whoopi and he's like a real famous guy and [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10918.800000000001s)]
*  he's got like big like Sesame Street monster hair? Bruce Vellanche? [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10923.04s)]
*  Yeah, like did Bruce Vellanche come up with their secret weapons? [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10927.12s)]
*  Someone, I've read something about wasps that inject their larva into other creatures. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10931.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10942.400000000001s)]
*  That like, you know, create like a, what would that call, like an alien sort of infestation thing. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10942.720000000001s)]
*  There's more of them than there are every other kind of insect. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10948.16s)]
*  Well, that's a great idea. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10954.32s)]
*  The female wasp injects the caterpillar with her eggs and a virus which shuts down the [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10956.32s)]
*  caterpillar's ability to defend itself against these intruders. The wasp larva [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10960.88s)]

*  They do. There's a shit ton of different wasps that do this kind of thing. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10974.16s)]
*  So the virus is so your body, the body doesn't reject like, like the, uh. [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=10978.64s)]

*  I just, I, that's what I think everything is now. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11004.72s)]
*  But what this article was talking about, or was it a video? It might've been a video I was watching [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11007.199999999999s)]
*  where they were talking about how the sheer number of different parasitic wasps is insane. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11012.08s)]
*  There's like a hundred different ones. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11019.039999999999s)]
*  That inject. Yeah. There's some that do it into the wood. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11021.359999999999s)]

*  Was that part of nature? [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11040.08s)]
*  And we put a stop to it. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11040.96s)]
*  Pull up the wood wasp. Check this thing out. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11044.32s)]
*  Cause didn't his penis fall off much like a wasp sting. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11046.64s)]

*  So look at that thing it's got at the end of it. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11060.960000000001s)]
*  And it shoves that into like these cracks where these larva are inside of these trees. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11063.04s)]
*  And it injects them. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11070.720000000001s)]
*  That's Harvey all right. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11072.480000000001s)]
*  So make sure I'm not fucking that up. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11076.0s)]
*  It's called a horn tail or a wood wasp. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11077.92s)]
*  And does it say what they're injecting themselves into? [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11080.32s)]
*  Let's see. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11083.2s)]
*  So there's like a bunch of different wasps that do this type of shit. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11085.28s)]
*  Yeah, drills her of the positive tour. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11089.68s)]

*  That's what Zuckerberg calls his dick. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11101.52s)]
*  My positive positive to the rescue. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11103.28s)]
*  Nearly three quarters of an inch into the world. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11106.8s)]
*  Three quarters of an inch of a weakened or dying tree and lays one to seven of her eggs. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11108.8s)]
*  The same time she squirts in a fungus from her abdominal gland, she continues this process, [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11114.32s)]
*  laying up to 200 eggs each. [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11120.48s)]
*  OK, this is different. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11122.16s)]
*  So this is not this is her larva. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11123.519999999999s)]
*  She's just shooting it into the wood and then putting this fungus on them. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11128.08s)]
*  This is not a that. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11133.679999999998s)]
*  Alien is softer wood. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11135.68s)]
*  It's still a parasite, isn't it? [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11136.960000000001s)]
*  Even if it's against wood. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11139.12s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not what I'm thinking of. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11140.4s)]
*  I'm thinking of there's a bunch of different ones that inject their larva into other creatures [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11142.08s)]
*  and make their they paralyze the creature and then the body just [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11149.12s)]
*  swarms with these little larvae. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11153.04s)]
*  Oh, you just reminded me of something. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11154.64s)]
*  Shitload of them like that. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11156.0s)]
*  The caterpillar thing, it said it saved human lives because it would. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11157.2s)]
*  It helps with agriculture and growing stuff. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11160.08s)]
*  Stopping the caterpillar for me. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11164.16s)]
*  How many lives save for? [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11165.36s)]
*  It's a 20 million. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11166.640000000001s)]
*  That's why 20 million. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11167.52s)]
*  Yeah, because caterpillars eat that many crops. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11168.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it actually makes sense. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11170.800000000001s)]
*  Right here. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11172.960000000001s)]
*  And then if 20 million lives. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11173.6s)]
*  Wow. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11175.12s)]
*  Like I said, did a wasp write this? [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11176.960000000001s)]
*  This effort. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11180.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, so what they do, they drop them. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11181.76s)]
*  Look at this. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11183.84s)]
*  After rearing the wasp and gathering funding, [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11184.400000000001s)]
*  Heron brought planes and coordinated strategic air drops and ground release of wasp cocoons [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11187.04s)]
*  to areas affected by the mealy bug. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11194.32s)]
*  For those locations, the wasp populations grew and spread on their own, [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11197.36s)]
*  reducing the mealy bug population to manageable levels for years. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11201.119999999999s)]
*  Wow, that's a fucking science experiment. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11205.039999999999s)]
*  When did this happen? [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11207.199999999999s)]
*  1995. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11210.8s)]

*  I already did the thing like two hours ago. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11215.76s)]
*  What happened to murder hornets when we're supposed to be scared of murder hornets? [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11218.0s)]
*  I never. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11221.119999999999s)]

*  over the years. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11290.32s)]
*  More than any UFO would be covered up. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11291.039999999999s)]

*  That's a little too gay for me. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11418.720000000001s)]
*  And two, we already have a straight romantic, [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11420.08s)]

*  Well, I mean, he made the successful, [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11436.4s)]
*  because that's what that is, that movie. [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11438.8s)]
*  It's his writing, though. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11440.48s)]
*  You should read some of his stuff. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11442.32s)]
*  He says the movie's better than the book himself, right? [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11443.84s)]
*  Does he, like, I thought. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11446.32s)]

*  I'm saying some of his other stuff. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11452.8s)]
*  He wrote a series of horror stories, [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11454.24s)]
*  and one of them is about, I think it's a little girl [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11456.56s)]
*  who turns into a werewolf on a plane. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11458.8s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11461.6s)]
*  I remember a book came out of his that at the time, [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11463.2s)]
*  it's like when I was getting out of. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11466.24s)]
*  Make sure that's him who wrote that. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11467.28s)]
*  When I was getting out of our institute, [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11468.32s)]
*  that people were, like, throwing up at the readings of some. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11469.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11472.0s)]
*  He's been asked to leave these writers' groups [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11472.72s)]
*  because his stuff was too disturbing. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11477.52s)]
*  He talked about that. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11480.0s)]
*  You know, he talked about, like, you have to be free [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11480.960000000001s)]
*  to make disturbing things. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11483.36s)]
*  Otherwise, like, how do you know? [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11484.880000000001s)]
*  How do you know what you're doing? [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11487.36s)]
*  You've got to be free to express yourself. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11489.36s)]
*  And some of it's not pretty. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11492.08s)]
*  And some of the stuff that's not pretty [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11493.68s)]
*  is fucking fascinating to people, especially. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11495.36s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to graphically describe [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11498.4s)]
*  someone's asshole being sucked out of a jet engine. [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11500.4s)]

*  Listen, that is how it would go. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11506.72s)]
*  You have your asshole near the jet engine. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11508.96s)]
*  It just pulls it right out of your body [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11510.96s)]
*  and wraps it up in a spiral. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11512.32s)]
*  They should warn people about it. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11514.08s)]
*  Haunted. That's it. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11515.84s)]

*  This sounds like how the Scooby Gang explains [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11662.32s)]
*  the fake Sasquatch. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11664.48s)]
*  They would have got away with it. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11667.76s)]
*  I think at one point in time there was a Sasquatch. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11669.279999999999s)]
*  And I think it's proven. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11672.0s)]
*  There's a thing called Gigantopithecus. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11673.279999999999s)]
*  And they think that at one point in time people [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11675.199999999999s)]
*  probably lived alongside those things. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11676.96s)]
*  And that's probably this sort of myth that goes through [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11678.96s)]
*  all these different cultures. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11684.0s)]
*  So they at one point in time there probably [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11685.04s)]
*  was a thing like that. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11686.400000000001s)]
*  They discovered hobbits. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11687.2s)]
*  I'm not sure hobbits. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11688.640000000001s)]
*  And I guess they were three foot tall people. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11690.24s)]
*  Yeah, on the island of Flores. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11692.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to a gentleman this past weekend in Hawaii [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11694.400000000001s)]
*  who was explaining to me how they had a similar thing in Hawaii. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11697.84s)]
*  It was like these two foot tall little hairy people. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11701.52s)]
*  If you think about that whole area, [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11706.16s)]
*  it's part of the myths and cultures. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11708.560000000001s)]
*  Myths of their culture, rather. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11710.720000000001s)]
*  And I want to say myths. [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11712.16s)]
*  I should say legend. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11713.12s)]
*  Because it probably was real. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11714.24s)]
*  At one point in time somebody probably encountered [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11716.16s)]
*  this little thing that we know for sure existed alongside people. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11719.2s)]
*  And it existed on the island of Flores. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11722.72s)]
*  And they think it existed in other places. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11724.48s)]
*  They call it the Orang Pendek. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11726.24s)]
*  There's like different names for it in different parts of the world. [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11727.84s)]
*  But now that we know it was really a thing, [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11730.4s)]
*  all those stories about people seeing them back in the day [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11732.88s)]
*  were probably real. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11736.56s)]
*  I thought the Flores ones they hunted like little elephants. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11739.12s)]
*  Something adorable. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11742.32s)]
*  I swear it got like- [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11744.0s)]
*  Well, there's a thing called island dwarfism. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11744.64s)]
*  Yeah, island dwarfism. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11746.72s)]
*  Yeah, when you do have like small elephants who live on an island. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11747.84s)]
*  Yeah, they would have the team of them would take down a tiny elephant. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11750.64s)]
*  That's the sweetest. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11753.52s)]
*  Sweetest little murder. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11755.52s)]
*  You know that wildebeest thing you showed me? [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11756.64s)]
*  If they were little ones, that would be adorable. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11758.64s)]
*  Dude, you know how wild that would be to watch? [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11760.64s)]
*  Chibi animals going down. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11762.72s)]
*  Because if they were using tools and weapons, they were hunting things. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11764.56s)]
*  How wild that would be to watch them? [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11769.12s)]
*  First of all, how fast do you think they were? [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11771.439999999999s)]
*  Two foot tall people? [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11775.519999999999s)]
*  Well, the thing is, it's just scaled down. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11777.199999999999s)]
*  So they don't have to be fast. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11778.72s)]
*  They just have to have longer endurance, right? [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11779.68s)]
*  Yeah, but they're living in the jungle. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11781.519999999999s)]
*  Dude, they got to be fast. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11783.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11786.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm sure it's sped up. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11786.64s)]
*  Comically is how I imagine. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11789.039999999999s)]
*  Like a monkey. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11790.4s)]
*  I imagine Benny Hill music in the background. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11791.68s)]
*  I wonder like what a human, if you went back to the original human, [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11794.72s)]
*  like the earliest version of the anatomically current human being, [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11798.32s)]
*  whatever that was, 500, 700,000 years ago, whatever it was. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11803.36s)]
*  I would love to see what that dude looked like when he walked around. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11807.92s)]
*  Like what was that like? [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11811.2s)]
*  What did they do? [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11812.48s)]
*  Like what was a day in the life of one of them? [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11813.84s)]
*  Imagine following one of those guys. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11816.32s)]
*  Imagine being in a time machine where you could just exist in a bubble that no one could see [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11818.24s)]
*  and you could follow around some dude living 900,000 years ago. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11823.68s)]
*  How fucking wild would that be just to imagine that this guy just figuring out you could [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11830.32s)]
*  bang rocks into the shape of a tool that this guy is one day going to pilot an airplane? [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11835.68s)]
*  That this guy's. [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11840.64s)]
*  I bet it's a lot like you ever watch like Alaska Wilderness People and you're in, [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11842.08s)]
*  if it's not a reality show, they're clipping it together. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11846.4s)]
*  It's probably real dull. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11848.64s)]
*  You ever see reality shows made? [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11849.6s)]
*  It's just hours of. [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11851.52s)]
*  So you'd spend hours watching anything, but you'd want someone to aggregate the interesting parts [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11852.88s)]
*  to you. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11856.88s)]
*  Look at this. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11858.0s)]
*  Peter claims these ancient ancestors of ours could theoretically reach sprinting speeds of [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11858.72s)]
*  up to 20 miles an hour. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11863.439999999999s)]
*  That seems fast. [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11864.8s)]
*  It's not known what speeds the likes of Usain Bolt's, [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11865.759999999998s)]
*  Johann Blake or Tyson Gray could reach if they were being chased in fear of their lives. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11869.439999999999s)]
*  Good point. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11874.56s)]
*  How fast do can they run by the way, Usain Bolt? [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11875.119999999999s)]
*  About 23 is what this is. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11878.0s)]
*  I suggest a group of humans are capable of running up to 23. [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11880.8s)]
*  This guy found some footprints in Australia and use those as. [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11883.76s)]
*  Didn't they find some footprints that they just discovered like way older than they thought in [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11888.24s)]
*  Spain? [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11891.84s)]
*  I think they found some in America. [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11893.12s)]
*  They found some footprints in it. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11894.88s)]
*  Yeah, they definitely found some in Spain, but they found some in America that takes our idea [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11896.16s)]
*  of when human beings were here way, way, way back. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11902.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11904.8s)]
*  Way further than they thought it was like way earlier than 11,000 years ago. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11905.36s)]
*  Well, just the whole idea that was other years. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11909.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's not as old as they thought. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11912.560000000001s)]
*  It's thousands of years later, but it's still really fucking old. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11914.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, this is in North America. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11917.84s)]
*  What does it say there? [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11919.04s)]
*  What does the top say? [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11919.76s)]
*  It says the discovery of the oldest human footprints in North America. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11920.800000000001s)]
*  Thrilled researchers. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11924.320000000002s)]
*  It turns out they may not be so old. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11925.6s)]
*  So what was what did they think they were and what are they? [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11929.52s)]
*  Okay, so the results implied the footprints were that were left behind between 22,800 years [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11933.04s)]
*  ago and 21,130 years ago. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11938.88s)]
*  Previously, the earliest known humans beings in North America were dated between 14,000 [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11941.439999999999s)]
*  and 16,000 years. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11946.56s)]
*  If true, the conclusion could upend all manner of assumptions in the field. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11948.0s)]
*  The team published its findings in Science last year. [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11951.679999999998s)]
*  This is a bombshell. [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11954.88s)]
*  Ruth Groon, an academic archaeologist not involved in the study observed. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11956.24s)]
*  It's very hard to disprove. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11961.119999999999s)]
*  And so then what happened that went bad? [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11962.8s)]
*  What's the difference? [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11965.839999999998s)]
*  Okay, radiocarbon dating on go back up a little bit radiocarbon dating on ancient grass seeds [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11967.039999999999s)]
*  found in the footprints determined they were made between 23,000 years ago. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11974.64s)]
*  So what is what's incorrect about it? [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11979.599999999999s)]
*  It's still really fucking old. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11983.199999999999s)]
*  What's it saying there? [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11987.76s)]
*  Hmm. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11990.32s)]
*  I don't know what they're saying because it doesn't seem like they're saying anything. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11992.24s)]
*  Why they think it's not as old. [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11997.039999999999s)]
*  The very, very good that just said it moved by a thousand years. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=11999.84s)]
*  Oh, so went from 23 to 22,000. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12002.56s)]
*  I guess that's right. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12005.599999999999s)]
*  Still old as fuck. [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12006.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12007.599999999999s)]
*  It's like a lot older than they used to think it was. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12008.16s)]
*  So okay. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12011.039999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12011.68s)]
*  So it was 22,000 to 21,000. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12011.92s)]
*  Okay. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12014.64s)]
*  So they've pushed it back a thousand years. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12014.96s)]
*  A lot of stuff based on dates that are like way you ever see the, you know, [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12016.64s)]
*  when they get it right with like a dinosaur skeleton, I mean, as far as you know, [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12021.199999999999s)]
*  how like off it is. [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12025.359999999999s)]
*  Somebody did a cool thing where they showed if like you found horse bones, [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12027.279999999999s)]
*  like what the way we draw the dinosaurs, what it would look like. [[03:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12030.24s)]
*  It looks crazy because it's always too tight on the skeleton. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12033.119999999999s)]
*  You know, there's not enough like meat built on it when in most of the conceptions. [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12036.4s)]
*  Right. [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12040.4s)]
*  We have no idea what they are. [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12040.88s)]
*  Imagine what a T-Rex actually looks like. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12042.56s)]
*  I like to look for the updates of like what they, you know, [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12044.16s)]
*  because even they had a good like dinosaur show. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12047.279999999999s)]
*  I liked at the time on a discovery or something, [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12050.0s)]
*  but even those are all like, they don't have feathers either. [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12052.72s)]
*  They think a lot of them had feathers now, but not T-Rex is the last I heard on. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12056.24s)]
*  Really? [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12060.64s)]
*  That's the last thing that I heard looking up. [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12061.519999999999s)]
*  But they don't think you had feathers? [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12063.679999999998s)]
*  No. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12065.359999999999s)]
*  And it's because there's a patch of the skin pressed up on something where you can see it's not. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12065.679999999998s)]
*  I just was looking up some article. [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12071.84s)]
*  This is kind of recent. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12073.199999999999s)]
*  Oh, maybe that's what it is. [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12074.88s)]
*  I don't know if this was a T-Rex they found specifically. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12076.56s)]
*  So it's hard to imagine this animal died 76 million years ago. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12078.8s)]
*  It's been perfectly preserved since then and just happened to be starting to erode out of this cliff [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12082.16s)]
*  when we were walking by. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12089.44s)]
*  Wow. [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12090.96s)]
*  That's fucking nuts. [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12093.039999999999s)]
*  Because you've really only seen a fraction of all the stuff that there was, right? [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12094.16s)]
*  Because fossils are kind of rare. [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12098.08s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12100.72s)]
*  So these guys are seeing this stuff erode and then they find it there. [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12101.2s)]
*  How much more? [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12105.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12106.16s)]
*  How much more of that is there? [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12106.4s)]
*  That's what's nuts. [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12107.68s)]
*  What percentage of the fossil record is really accurate in terms of how many species are out there [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12109.359999999999s)]
*  that haven't been discovered? [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12118.4s)]
*  It's like a fraction of what it is. [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12119.199999999999s)]
*  I wonder what other dinosaurs existed that they haven't found a body yet. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12121.6s)]
*  Only animals that have bones like that that can be preserved are going to be preserved. [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12127.039999999999s)]
*  And they have to be caught up in a landslide or some shit, right? [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12131.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12134.88s)]
*  It's real specific. [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12135.119999999999s)]
*  Because you always say it's a rare process, [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12137.039999999999s)]
*  fossilization, but then you read these stories when they first found them [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12139.28s)]
*  and they have dinosaur bone wars and they're blowing them up in war. [[03:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12142.64s)]
*  Well, you know, these are faking it too. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12147.2s)]
*  Guys were faking dinosaurs. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12148.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12150.56s)]
*  There were some people that faked dinosaurs back in the day. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12150.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12153.36s)]
*  Had they put them together wrong and all kinds of hilarious things. [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12153.6s)]
*  There's a whole thing about the first two guys that found dinosaur bones and figured out. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12156.0s)]
*  You imagine being the first guy to find something [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12161.279999999999s)]
*  that indicates there was giant lizards roaming the earth. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12164.32s)]
*  What is this? [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12168.56s)]
*  Two dinosaurs that found a T-rex and a triceratops locked in a battle. [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12169.199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12172.88s)]
*  So they're probably fighting to the death and got caught up in a landslide. [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12173.359999999999s)]
*  Weighs 14 tons. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12176.08s)]
*  Holy shit. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12177.84s)]
*  You got to be trained too because that just looks like someone stepped on a bug to me. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12179.119999999999s)]
*  I'm like, wow, you guys. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12183.439999999999s)]
*  Look at the ribs, man. [[03:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12184.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12186.0s)]
*  That's fucking wild. [[03:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12186.64s)]
*  It also shows you how not Indiana Jones' archaeology is where you're just gently brushing some dust. [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12188.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12195.519999999999s)]
*  Not. [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12196.4s)]
*  Very slowly in that case. [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12197.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12198.56s)]
*  To try to find these ancient dead creatures. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12199.119999999999s)]
*  A bullwhip never comes into it. [[03:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12202.08s)]
*  No need for a satchel. [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12205.6s)]
*  He's got an IWC pilot's watch on. [[03:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12210.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's that whole way of discovering things that used to exist is so crazy if you think about [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12213.439999999999s)]
*  it that way that it has to die in a very specific way to make a fossil. [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12220.48s)]
*  There's that one dinosaur that they had in one of the Jurassic Park movies that fights a T-rex [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12224.72s)]
*  and they just figured out totally. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12229.92s)]
*  They just made one up, right? [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12231.84s)]
*  That giant thing? [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12234.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12235.039999999999s)]
*  The raptor is a little made up. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12235.439999999999s)]
*  Well, the raptor, but there's another one. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12236.72s)]
*  The way that they did in the movie, yeah. [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12239.439999999999s)]
*  There's another one to fight with the T-rex dinosaur. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12241.119999999999s)]
*  I'm forgetting what his name is, but they just discovered it probably was aquatic [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12245.279999999999s)]
*  and not how they have it in the movie. [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12249.359999999999s)]
*  It was right after that. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12251.6s)]
*  One of the skeletons got blown up in World War II. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12253.199999999999s)]
*  That was the really good skeleton and then I don't know if they found another one or something, [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12256.0s)]
*  but that's why they didn't know because it got blown up in the war. [[03:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12260.24s)]
*  Oh, really? [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12262.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12263.519999999999s)]
*  There was a house that was for sale in Malibu, this crazy, no, not Malibu, in Beverly Hills. [[03:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12264.88s)]
*  This crazy fucking house. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12269.76s)]
*  And it had a raptor skeleton included in the purchase. [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12271.92s)]
*  Was that that debacle, $300 million one they had? [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12274.960000000001s)]
*  No, it wasn't that crazy. [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12277.6s)]
*  It was crazy though, but it was like $30 million crazy. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12278.880000000001s)]
*  But one of the million and the $30 million was a dinosaur. [[03:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12282.4s)]
*  They had a fucking raptor. [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12286.800000000001s)]
*  You know how dope that'd be? [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12289.28s)]
*  Come on my house. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12290.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, here's a dinosaur. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12290.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's cool. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12292.64s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12293.2s)]
*  I'll tell you what, it's more respectable than a $50,000 blunt. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12293.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a little ridiculous. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12298.0s)]
*  But I think that's a million dollars. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12299.6s)]
*  Remember Chappelle's show where he had cribs where he's like, he has Tyrannosaur eggs. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12301.04s)]
*  He sprinkles diamonds in it because it makes his dookie twinkle. [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12310.32s)]
*  He was just being like, oh, it smelled wild. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12318.4s)]
*  Should you be allowed to own a dinosaur? [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12323.76s)]
*  Can you sell a dinosaur? [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12326.4s)]
*  How much would it cost to buy a dinosaur? [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12327.76s)]
*  Why not? [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12329.68s)]
*  They found some bones, a giant in a guy's backyard. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12330.24s)]
*  Like, should you be able to keep that? [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12333.2s)]
*  That's a good question. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12334.56s)]
*  Is that yours? [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12335.6s)]

*  Why the hell not? [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12340.16s)]
*  Go to YouTube and look what's going on in Libya. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12341.6s)]
*  That's what that was on? [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12344.48s)]
*  You're welcome Libya, by the way. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12345.76s)]
*  We came, we saw. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12348.24s)]

*  It's unreal what they're saying. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12354.0s)]
*  Oh, do you just let them kill their own people? [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12355.44s)]
*  They had this highest standard of living in Africa before we helped out. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12357.44s)]
*  Now it's a failed state. [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12363.2s)]
*  Yeah, now they have slave markets. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12365.2s)]
*  Open slave markets that you could watch on YouTube. [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12369.2s)]
*  There's no infrastructure. [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12372.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12373.36s)]
*  But there was an infrastructure. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12375.52s)]
*  They destroyed it. [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12376.720000000001s)]
*  But when you have brutal war after brutal war, you have areas of this world where they've been [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12378.560000000001s)]
*  under the control of dictators and then you just get rid of that dictator. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12384.4s)]
*  You have all these people that have been living in this brutal scenario with these totalitarian [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12388.24s)]
*  governments and executions and military and then another powerhouse just comes in and takes over. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12394.16s)]
*  It's like prison gangs taking over. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12400.24s)]
*  But his thing was, I remember, this is the thing I remember that just, [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12402.32s)]
*  there was a moment during the war on terror that I remember they were kind of rehabbing his image [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12406.48s)]
*  because he would go on the news and he was saying like, we need to stop this Islamic terror. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12410.8s)]
*  He was saying that and he came to America in his big tent. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12414.72s)]
*  Everybody talked about it. [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12418.24s)]
*  And he had those Ukrainian or whatever all female guard. [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12419.599999999999s)]
*  Remember all this stuff about him? [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12423.199999999999s)]
*  He was going to go off the Pedro dollar, which I never even heard of until a couple years ago. [[03:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12425.039999999999s)]
*  And that's when he had to go because they had built him up like, hey, [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12429.199999999999s)]
*  you know, he's like an elder statesman and he's learned. [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12433.119999999999s)]
*  The next thing you know, it's a bayonet rape. [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12435.759999999998s)]
*  Dude, the way they killed him, when you see that video, the sheer animalistic terror in his eyes, [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12439.04s)]
*  it's like a scene in a movie. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12445.76s)]
*  It's like it's so stunning to see a guy who is a dictator getting captured by rebels and [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12447.52s)]
*  murdered right in front of you. [[03:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12454.0s)]
*  Well, they show that bayonet up his ass and he doesn't even blink. [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12455.44s)]
*  I mean, well, probably in shock. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12459.04s)]
*  He was 100% in shock. [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12461.52s)]
*  But the fact that guy just shoves it up his ass and he's just sitting there. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12462.720000000001s)]
*  He's thinking I should have stayed on that Petro dollar. [[03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12466.480000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12469.28s)]
*  That's the first thing he was thinking. [[03:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12470.560000000001s)]
*  I take it back. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12471.84s)]
*  Remember the story? [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12472.880000000001s)]
*  Because I remember I saw a movie, a documentary called Mad Dog Killer. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12473.76s)]
*  And I remember seeing one about Saddam Hussein when I was younger. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12477.6s)]
*  Not that I was a fan of Saddam Hussein, but it was like there's one part where [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12481.6s)]
*  they're talking about his kids, you know? [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12485.36s)]
*  Oh, murderous sons. [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12486.640000000001s)]
*  Even his daughter once said to a classmate, I want to tear the teacher's vagina out. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12488.160000000002s)]
*  And then they show his daughter, she's like, I don't know, nine in this thing. [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12492.640000000001s)]
*  She's dancing. [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12495.68s)]
*  And they put it in slow-mo. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12496.320000000002s)]
*  She's like, is this a smear job? [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12498.0s)]
*  As a guy who's not into Saddam Hussein, it seemed a little bit much. [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12503.12s)]
*  But also probably accurate. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12506.800000000001s)]
*  You know what the sons did, right? [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12508.4s)]
*  Well, that devil's double thing, that guy might be completely full of shit. [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12510.4s)]
*  And I think probably is. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12515.68s)]
*  What is that? [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12516.800000000001s)]
*  The whole story about he had to get surgery to look like Uday. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12517.6s)]
*  Oh, I did hear about that. [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12521.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's another. [[03:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12522.64s)]
*  I'm not talking about that. [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12523.44s)]
*  I'm talking about what they used to do with Uday. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12524.4s)]
*  His brother, Kousse, used to do. [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12528.08s)]
*  They used to kidnap women on their wedding day and feed them to their dogs. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12529.6s)]
*  They'd rape them and feed them to their dogs. [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12534.24s)]
*  I mean. [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12536.640000000001s)]
*  They did horrific shit. [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12536.960000000001s)]
*  I have no. [[03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12538.720000000001s)]
*  Here's why it's easy. [[03:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12540.24s)]
*  Especially when it's time. [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12542.720000000001s)]
*  You know, also Saddam was given the key to the city of Dearborn, Michigan. [[03:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12544.0s)]
*  When I was young. [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12548.24s)]
*  Was he? [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12548.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, when we liked him, when he fought Iran. [[03:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12549.76s)]
*  So I bet they did all kinds of crazy stuff and we liked him. [[03:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12552.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden, now that we don't like you, now it's a problem that you do this. [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12555.52s)]
*  Because there is no. [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12560.08s)]
*  I mean. [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12561.2s)]
*  That's what's scary, dude. [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12562.24s)]
*  Is it how much of the world is under the thumb of a dictator like that? [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12563.36s)]
*  Most of it. [[03:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12568.640000000001s)]
*  As long as you do business with us how we want you to, you're good, man. [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12569.04s)]
*  That's all you got to do. [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12573.44s)]
*  And then that's like Gaddafi. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12574.560000000001s)]
*  That's when it becomes a problem. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12576.32s)]
*  I think that was for France, actually. [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12577.6s)]
*  Because some rebels had promised a bunch of his money went to France. [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12579.92s)]
*  In Haiti now, like, you know, we killed their president. [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12585.92s)]
*  That was news briefly. [[03:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12590.0s)]
*  Who killed their president? [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12592.0s)]
*  I think we did. [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12593.44s)]
*  Are you unsubstantiated allegations on this nationally syndicated program? [[03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12595.36s)]
*  Well, I saw it on breaking points. [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12599.84s)]
*  Oh. [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12601.52s)]
*  Initially. [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12601.76s)]
*  What did they say? [[03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12602.48s)]
*  They said it's something funny going on and then never talked about it again. [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12604.0s)]
*  But do they say that we actually executed them? [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12606.960000000001s)]
*  The guy when they. [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12609.92s)]
*  What happened? [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12611.2s)]
*  I don't. [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12611.68s)]
*  I'm ignorant to the story. [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12612.0s)]
*  OK. [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12612.960000000001s)]
*  There's no you're you're acting as if this is something that everybody knows about. [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12613.2s)]
*  You don't know about do you? [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12616.400000000001s)]
*  No, I do. [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12618.800000000001s)]
*  So so what happened? [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12619.92s)]
*  So one of the guys that got caught, you know, they caught the shooters. [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12621.6s)]
*  Haiti president's assassination. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12624.880000000001s)]
*  What we know so far. [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12626.560000000001s)]
*  I wasn't cutting into just showing you the stuff. [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12627.68s)]
*  So when was he assassinated? [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12632.0s)]
*  January of this year. [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12633.92s)]
*  OK. [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12637.6s)]
*  The guy, the mercenary. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12638.08s)]
*  Private residence in the capital. [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12639.68s)]
*  Port of Prince. [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12642.08s)]
*  Oh, last year plunge the country already suffered. [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12642.64s)]
*  Where's it say? [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12646.32s)]
*  How was he killed? [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12646.88s)]
*  He was shot dead inside his home in the Perlin five neighborhood in the hills above Port [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12648.0s)]
*  of Prince at zero one hundred local time on seven July twenty twenty one. [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12653.519999999999s)]
*  According to police, the president was shot twelve times and had bullet wounds to his [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12660.4s)]
*  forehead and several to his torso. [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12664.88s)]
*  His left eye had been gouged out and bones in his arm and his ankle had been broken. [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12666.88s)]
*  According to one of the judges conducting the investigation, he died at the scene. [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12672.0s)]
*  It was found laying on the floor on his back, his shirt soaked in blood. [[03:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12676.72s)]
*  The first lady, Martine Moise, Moise was also shot but survived. [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12680.64s)]
*  Where's the guy? [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12685.68s)]
*  But the thing is, the mercenaries, the guy is recorded saying like, [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12686.48s)]
*  that's the thing to find. [[03:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12691.28s)]
*  That's what I first saw was that recording, which I saw on breaking points. [[03:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12692.24s)]
*  Now what recording? [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12696.96s)]
*  One of the killers was speaking in English and saying like, [[03:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12699.199999999999s)]
*  I don't even want to quote it. [[03:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12703.119999999999s)]
*  You could probably find it. [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12704.72s)]
*  Well, we'll find it. [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12705.84s)]
*  Let's find it. [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12706.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[03:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12707.52s)]
*  So that's what I first heard about it. [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12708.32s)]

*  I never heard any more reporting on it for a good long while until the reporting that we just sent [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12746.1s)]
*  a bunch of like heavy duty equipment to quell the protests. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12750.9s)]

*  But that's I heard that and then nothing about it. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12758.5s)]
*  So a US firm hired to hit people? [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12761.859999999999s)]

*  What was the Haiti president opposed to? [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12793.460000000001s)]
*  Well, I don't know what this initial one, but basically we get a lot of cheap labor comes out [[03:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12797.14s)]
*  of there. [[03:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12801.380000000001s)]
*  So a while back when Hillary was in, they quelled the thing because they wanted like [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12802.1s)]
*  they want their pays like sub what our prisoners make. [[03:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12806.58s)]

*  They had two US mercenaries. [[03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12825.380000000001s)]
*  But you know Haiti's story, right? [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12828.18s)]
*  They had to pay. [[03:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12829.78s)]
*  They were like the only successful slave revolt I think in like history. [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12831.14s)]
*  And they had to pay reparations for rebellion against it. [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12836.34s)]
*  They had to pay for reparations of France until the 80s. [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12840.74s)]
*  What? [[03:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12843.460000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12845.220000000001s)]
*  For rebelling? [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12845.54s)]
*  For yeah. [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12846.9s)]
*  They they caused them their slaves. [[03:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12847.7s)]
*  No way. [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12851.220000000001s)]
*  Look it up if you don't believe me. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12852.66s)]
*  How do you sleep at night? [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12854.5s)]

*  But that's the problem, isn't it? [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12858.34s)]
*  Makes you want to dig into the stuff more. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12859.86s)]
*  No, I would say don't dig into any of it is my advice. [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12863.54s)]
*  When France extorted Haiti after enduring decades of exploitation of the hands of the French, [[03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12867.54s)]
*  Haiti somehow ended up paying reparations to the tune of nearly 30 billion in today's money. [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12872.5s)]
*  Is that you would think that would be a bigger thing. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12879.7s)]
*  But there's a lot of interest. [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12884.74s)]
*  There's a lot of I'm sure bipartisan interest in keeping it how it is. [[03:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12885.94s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12891.14s)]
*  Oh, remember all those Haitian immigrants are coming in. [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12893.14s)]
*  They were saying they were whipping them, but it was like the reins on the guy's horse. [[03:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12894.98s)]
*  Yeah, that was people at the border. [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12900.98s)]
*  They just had a photo that made it look like maybe he had swung that at somebody. [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12903.38s)]
*  But it was really just everything so god damn dishonest and also like one that sell links, [[03:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12908.66s)]
*  right? [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12914.26s)]
*  The fact. [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12914.58s)]
*  Yeah, clicks, but not like the fact that Haiti paid reparations for not being slaves. [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12914.98s)]
*  Okay, that's like a wild fact that I didn't know until five minutes ago. [[03:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12920.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12925.14s)]
*  So instead of making up a whipping thing with a picture, [[03:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12925.38s)]
*  why wouldn't you be talking about real things? [[03:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12928.1s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12929.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12930.58s)]
*  Well, because you don't give a shit. [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQGjSzldd3A&t=12931.8s)]
