# Joe Rogan Experience #1922 - Sam & Colby
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6.0s)]
*  How'd you make it back? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=12.0s)]
*  So we were doing some stupid TikTok stuff during the pandemic and we were all challenging each other to do like stupid stuff. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=13.0s)]
*  And for some reason, that was a great idea to try to jump off of a second story balcony onto a bean bag. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=20.0s)]
*  But I missed, I missed the bean bag. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=27.0s)]
*  Missed the bean bag completely. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=28.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=29.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=30.0s)]
*  And you broke your back? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=32.0s)]
*  I was, you know, I did it a couple of times the previous week and I was like, I got this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=33.0s)]
*  This is going to be fine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=38.0s)]
*  And then I missed the bean bag. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=39.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I think I only fractured a couple of bones there, but you definitely took me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=41.0s)]
*  That's a real problem though. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=46.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=48.0s)]
*  Is this your, your. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=49.0s)]
*  Oh, geez. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=50.0s)]
*  Oh, please. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=51.0s)]
*  It's gruesome if you actually see it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=52.0s)]
*  So what did you get? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=54.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=56.0s)]
*  So did you have to get surgery? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=57.0s)]
*  I didn't have to get surgery, but I was in a back brace for like six months. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=59.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=64.0s)]
*  So that was really bad. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=65.0s)]
*  Have you ever wonder that like you guys are in all these fucking haunted places? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=67.0s)]
*  Do you ever wonder if you're carrying any of that shit around with you? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=72.0s)]
*  Well, definitely. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=77.0s)]
*  What was crazy is a lot of people think that the sign of something being with you is like back pain. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=79.0s)]
*  But now that I've broken my back, I'm like, I can't, I can't make that connection right there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=85.0s)]
*  That's a real back pain. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=90.0s)]
*  Not like, well, there's back pain where people just like their psychosomatic back pain. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=91.0s)]
*  Like there's a guy named John. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=96.0s)]
*  It wasn't John Sarno's. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=97.0s)]
*  Is that his name? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=99.0s)]
*  He had this weird theory about back pain that applied to some people, not people with actual real injuries, but some people that it's all in your head. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=100.0s)]
*  It's people that are like, like deeply stressed out and fucked up and it manifests itself as back pain. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=108.0s)]
*  And somehow or another, through his teaching, a lot of people, including Howard Stern, didn't Howard Stern have a thing with his back where John Sarno's fixed it? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=114.0s)]
*  There's a picture of him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=123.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=125.0s)]
*  America's most famous back pain doctor said pain is in your head. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=126.0s)]
*  Thousands think he's right. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=129.0s)]
*  Well, millions think he's wrong, though. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=131.0s)]
*  But that doesn't work. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=133.0s)]
*  He's not right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=135.0s)]
*  Like sometimes you have fucking real back pain. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=136.0s)]
*  You gotta get that fixed. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=138.0s)]
*  But for crazy people, for some people, like, you know, you just have something in your head and it's like, my back. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=139.0s)]
*  But it's really your psychology. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=146.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=149.0s)]
*  You're carrying it around with you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=150.0s)]
*  No, speaking, carrying things around. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=151.0s)]
*  A lot of people warn us that like because we go into so many haunted places, they're like, guys, you should be careful. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=153.0s)]
*  Like, aren't you worried about bringing this home or bringing this to other people? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=158.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=161.0s)]
*  We walked in here, obviously, it's probably just a coincidence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=162.0s)]
*  We walked here and immediately, you know, your curtain fell over. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah, not saying that's paranormal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=168.0s)]
*  That's not up for two years. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=170.0s)]
*  Never had a problem. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=172.0s)]
*  And then Jamie asked you a question. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=174.0s)]
*  You guys ever investigate anything that's bullshit? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=176.0s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, definitely. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=178.0s)]
*  And then boom, the curtain falls. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=180.0s)]
*  Like it's rigged. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=182.0s)]
*  Like they're listening. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=184.0s)]
*  That's what I'm wondering. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=186.0s)]
*  Jamie, was that something you set up? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=188.0s)]
*  Definitely isn't. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=189.0s)]
*  I know Jamie. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=190.0s)]
*  He's 100 percent anti bullshit. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=191.0s)]
*  Do you do you feel like that's possible that you could carry something like that with you? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=193.0s)]
*  We have a lot of people that tell us that we don't necessarily buy into it all that much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=200.0s)]
*  Like there's definitely things that reoccur place to place. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=205.0s)]
*  And it's not like, you know, the same. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=208.0s)]
*  It's not supposed to be the same haunting or whatever. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=211.0s)]
*  But we get the same thing that we think has been following us from multiple places. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=213.0s)]
*  Do we 100 percent buy that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=218.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=220.0s)]
*  But what's really weird is when people will look you dead in the eye and they'll be like, there is someone behind you. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=221.0s)]
*  And I've seen them for there for like an hour. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=227.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I can't see that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=230.0s)]
*  But I'm also not going to like brush that off my shoulder and saying that's like not there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=232.0s)]
*  So someone has said there's someone behind you, but there's no one behind you. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=237.0s)]
*  So who are these people that said there's someone behind you? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=243.0s)]
*  I mean, a bunch of different people like for us, we talk to a lot of people that are like mediums or like they like to tours or ghost hunts or anything like this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=246.0s)]
*  But I'm sketchy people, sketchy people, a little sketchy potentially. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=254.0s)]
*  We can't see these types of things. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=258.0s)]
*  So we've got to take other people's word for it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=260.0s)]
*  We're not saying part of the problem is there's like an incentive to sense things and feel things. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=262.0s)]
*  I'm not anti ghost by any stretch of the imagination. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=268.0s)]
*  I am open minded, but I know that there's a lot of people that like to pretend they like to pretend they have psychic powers. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=271.0s)]
*  They like to pretend they know things. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=280.0s)]
*  They like to pretend they've experienced things. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=282.0s)]
*  I've talked to so many people that have experienced like UFOs and I've talked to Bigfoot people that they've met Bigfoot. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=284.0s)]
*  Like it's there's people that pretend. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=291.0s)]
*  But then there's also the thing that freaks me out about ghosts is that it's been a reoccurring theme throughout human history. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=294.0s)]
*  And it's always it seems to be connected to some horrific death. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=302.0s)]
*  Like whenever there's a horrific death, it's almost like like that horrible moment like burns space and time and leaves a residue. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=307.0s)]
*  A lot of people think that's like trauma, like built into the place or like energies there. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=320.0s)]
*  Right. To your point, though, what's crazy about it is everybody has had experiences over time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=324.0s)]
*  You walk into any room and whether people believe or whether people don't, someone's got a story. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=332.0s)]
*  Someone's like, OK, I don't know if I believe, but this one time this happened. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=337.0s)]
*  And so the fact that like everyone, like pretty much no matter where you go, like has some sort of story, even if they're skeptical, it makes you wonder like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=341.0s)]
*  what if what else is out there? Yeah, there's been countless of times we'll go to these spots and like maybe we after hearing the story, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=348.0s)]
*  we don't think it's going to be like special at all. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=354.0s)]
*  But the person who owns the spot is like I levitated last week just staring us straight in the eyes, no hesitation like about it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=356.0s)]
*  And like obviously we've never experienced something that intense with the paranormal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=363.0s)]
*  But having dozens of people like every place we go to say that it's like, how do you when someone says they levitate, just say, hey, next time, set up your iPhone. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=367.0s)]
*  Film yourself, levitate. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=376.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=378.0s)]
*  Look at him and be like, are you sure? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=379.0s)]
*  Like how can a meds are you on while you're levitating? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=385.0s)]
*  Have you guys ever been to the Comedy Store? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=386.0s)]
*  No, but we were trying to. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah, listen, I can set that up. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=390.0s)]
*  The Comedy Store is without a doubt haunted. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=392.0s)]
*  We went there. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=394.0s)]
*  There's a place that's haunted in the world. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=395.0s)]
*  It's the Comedy Store because it used to be a mob nightclub and they've murdered people there. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=397.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=402.0s)]
*  It was Bugsy Seagull's nightclub. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=403.0s)]
*  It was called Ciro's. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=406.0s)]
*  And in the 1950s, was it the 50s and the 60s? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=408.0s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=411.0s)]
*  Sorry, in the 40s actually. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=412.0s)]
*  In the 40s? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=414.0s)]
*  But it's a famous old mob run nightclub that Mitzi Shore took over in the 1970s. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=415.0s)]
*  So the place has this feel to it. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=423.0s)]
*  Like it's been run as an entertainment venue for 70 years or something crazy like that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=427.0s)]
*  Isn't there a bunch of underground passageways around there too? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=433.0s)]
*  There's supposedly, there was actually an article about this house on Crest Hill. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=437.0s)]
*  Here, Whitney Cummings sent it to me, so I'll send it to you, Jamie. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=442.0s)]
*  But I almost bought this house in the 1990s. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=445.0s)]
*  In the 1990s, they were selling this house that the Comedy Store owned right above the club. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=449.0s)]
*  Is it this one? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=457.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=458.0s)]
*  And that's the one that's connected to the Comedy Store? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=459.0s)]
*  Yes, there's supposedly a tunnel because that's right above and to the left of the Comedy Club. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=461.0s)]
*  And that was also owned by Bugsy Seagull. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=467.0s)]
*  Stories from the Comedians who inhabited Crest Hill, the house above the Comedy Store. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=469.0s)]
*  So that house was for sale. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=473.0s)]
*  The Comedy Store was selling it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=476.0s)]
*  Mitzi was going to sell it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=477.0s)]
*  But the problem is, if you go back to that photo, it's got this tiny little bullshit yard. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=478.0s)]
*  That's the yard. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=483.0s)]
*  And I have a dog. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=484.0s)]
*  I had a dog back then too. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=485.0s)]
*  And I was like, I don't want to leave my dog in this bullshit yard. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=486.0s)]
*  Everybody needs an LA. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah, my dog needed a yard. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=491.0s)]
*  And also it's just too weird to be that close to the Comedy Store. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=493.0s)]
*  There were so many stalkers and freaks and have people just showing up at your house. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=498.0s)]
*  It's just right on the boulevard, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=502.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=504.0s)]
*  So Crest Hill is right off the boulevard, but it's right there. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=505.0s)]
*  It's a two minute walk from Sunset. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=509.0s)]
*  I've heard comedians like Bobby Lee in the past say that they've had issues there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=512.0s)]
*  People won't even work with them just based on the fact that he's worked there for so long. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=516.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=521.0s)]
*  Obviously I don't know too much about that, but he's talked about that in other podcasts and stuff. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=522.0s)]
*  That's haunted? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah, he says it's very haunted. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=527.0s)]
*  People don't want to work with him because he works there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=529.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=532.0s)]
*  It's like everybody that works there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=533.0s)]
*  That might be an excuse for why they don't want to work with Bobby. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=535.0s)]
*  That could be it. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=538.0s)]
*  Bobby, it might be you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=539.0s)]
*  I've never heard anybody say that before. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=540.0s)]
*  I can't work with you because you work at that haunted place. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah, they just don't want to be around that stuff. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=544.0s)]
*  Well, there are 100% are people that have stories, including multiple comedians, multiple managers of the place, waitresses at the place. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=547.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people that had stories of seeing weird things and meeting people that weren't there. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=556.0s)]
*  Have you ever had experience like that? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=562.0s)]
*  No, I tried. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=564.0s)]
*  I went down in the basement one day by myself. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=565.0s)]
*  I walked into the main room by myself. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=567.0s)]
*  Carl LeBeau, who recently passed away, Carl had the weirdest story. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=570.0s)]
*  He got kicked out of his house. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=575.0s)]
*  He got in a fight with his wife and he got kicked out of his house. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=577.0s)]
*  He went to the comedy store and decided he was going to sleep on the stage in the main room. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=581.0s)]
*  He's like, man, I'm going to fucking make it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=587.0s)]
*  I'm going to sleep on this stage. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=590.0s)]
*  She's going to kick me out of the house. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=592.0s)]
*  But one day I'll fucking show you. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=593.0s)]
*  So he's drunk and he lays down on the stage and then he hears a door shut. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=595.0s)]
*  The comedy store main room is pitch black. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=600.0s)]
*  This is what it looks like. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=604.0s)]
*  That's only when the lights are on. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=606.0s)]
*  So he's laying down and he hears a door shut. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=608.0s)]
*  He goes, Hey, it's Carl. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=612.0s)]
*  It's me, Carl. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=614.0s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=616.0s)]
*  And then he doesn't hear shit. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=618.0s)]
*  And then he hears chairs moving. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=619.0s)]
*  He hears like clink, clink, clink, clink. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=620.0s)]
*  And he's sitting there. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=623.0s)]
*  He's going, what the fuck is going on? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=624.0s)]
*  And something grabs his ankle and pulls him off the stage and onto the floor. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=626.0s)]
*  And then he hears chairs moving again and bam, the door shuts and slams and nothing else. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=630.0s)]
*  There's no one in the room. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=638.0s)]
*  He has no idea what the fuck happened. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=639.0s)]
*  But he told that story on stage one night. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=641.0s)]
*  It's like he set the tone. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=643.0s)]
*  It's like spooky lighting. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=645.0s)]
*  And it was really cool. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=647.0s)]
*  So he got pulled by his ankle off of the stage. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=648.0s)]
*  Off the stage. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=651.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=652.0s)]
*  Something grabbed him. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=653.0s)]
*  He didn't see anyone. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=654.0s)]
*  But something grabbed his ankle and pulled him off the stage and onto the floor. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=655.0s)]
*  That's when you want security footage. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=660.0s)]
*  Where's the cameras at? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=662.0s)]
*  There's no cameras in that place. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=664.0s)]
*  Maybe there is now, but they definitely wasn't back then. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=666.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=669.0s)]
*  When did you, so you guys started out, you weren't exploring haunted things. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=670.0s)]
*  We just started out like doing, it was like abandoned things. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=675.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=679.0s)]
*  We've had a long run at this. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=680.0s)]
*  I think we've been doing YouTube for like 10 years. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=681.0s)]
*  It's been a long time. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=683.0s)]
*  And it was abandoned. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=684.0s)]
*  And then before that it was like the trendy stuff. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=685.0s)]
*  And then even before that we started in public disturbance, like those pranks and stuff. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=687.0s)]
*  So you started when you were in high school? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=691.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=693.0s)]
*  I was 16. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=694.0s)]
*  Like one month turning 17. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=695.0s)]
*  So basically 17 we started. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=697.0s)]
*  And just for fun? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=699.0s)]
*  Just for fun. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=701.0s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=702.0s)]
*  A lot of it was also because we wanted, like we had a plan to become famous at the time. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=703.0s)]
*  Because as like 17 year olds, it's a whole long story to it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=709.0s)]
*  But like as 17 year olds, we just really wanted to do that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=712.0s)]
*  It was like a goal of ours. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=715.0s)]
*  Because we had just like become really, really good friends at the time. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=717.0s)]
*  And after like learning how to be confident, we were very shy kids in high school. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=720.0s)]
*  And learning how to be confident together, which again we can get into that story if you'd like. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=724.0s)]
*  How did you learn how to be confident? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=728.0s)]
*  We were both originally from Kansas. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=730.0s)]
*  Overland Park, Kansas. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=732.0s)]
*  We met in band camp when we were 14 years old. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=733.0s)]
*  That's where this story starts. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=736.0s)]
*  You know that's like a horrible story when you started off like that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=739.0s)]
*  But it was so bad to the point, like we were just like super socially awkward and very anxious people. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=742.0s)]
*  Like a lot of people. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=747.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=748.0s)]
*  But like I had, like it was so bad to the point where I had to like carry around these like Tums, the anti acid pills. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=749.0s)]
*  To just like honestly pop before each time I would go into like a new classroom. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=755.0s)]
*  And just in case I got called on, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't freaking out internally. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=759.0s)]
*  And so we bonded in band camp because we were both these like shy kids. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=764.0s)]
*  That didn't know how to talk to anybody. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=768.0s)]
*  What did you play in band camp? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=770.0s)]
*  Well we did, we both did saxophone. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=771.0s)]
*  I played marching band clarinet. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=774.0s)]
*  And it was like something that our parents like made us do as well. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=776.0s)]
*  And so together you decided you were going to figure out how to be confident. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=780.0s)]
*  Yeah, well we were like, okay, both of us, you know, are sitting there awkwardly being like, okay, I like that girl. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=785.0s)]
*  You like that girl. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=791.0s)]
*  We both can't talk to her. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=792.0s)]
*  So how do we fix this problem? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=793.0s)]
*  And that was the like a pit of you of our friendship. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=795.0s)]
*  That's very analytical. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=797.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=798.0s)]
*  Especially for being, because at that time we were 15. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=799.0s)]
*  This was like before social media and stuff. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=801.0s)]
*  And so we just decided one day we were like, why is Billy over there? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=804.0s)]
*  Why can he talk like to the hottest girls in the grade? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=808.0s)]
*  And we're over here like crying in front of people like trying to talk and stuff. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=810.0s)]
*  That's not fair. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=814.0s)]
*  Well, there is an important lesson there. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=815.0s)]
*  And it's a lesson of honesty. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=816.0s)]
*  Because some people want to pretend that they don't feel that way. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=818.0s)]
*  And if you pretend you don't feel that way, but you really do, you're never going to fix it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=821.0s)]
*  So if you try to play cool, and then you're just like setting yourself up and you're in a trap. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=825.0s)]
*  Because now you have to admit somehow down the line that you were full of shit back then. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=831.0s)]
*  Instead of facing the problem. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=835.0s)]
*  Instead of facing the problem at 15 going, hey, why can't we talk to people? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=836.0s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=839.0s)]
*  Like, let's work this out. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=840.0s)]
*  So what were the steps you took to work it out? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=842.0s)]
*  Well, there was a pretty much actually. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=845.0s)]
*  It ended up getting to that point. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=848.0s)]
*  So here we are sitting right here. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=850.0s)]
*  No, it was really like different. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=853.0s)]
*  I mean, there wasn't that many things to do in Kansas besides exploring abandoned places and then going to the mall. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=855.0s)]
*  So we decided, OK, what's going to help us with confidence? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=860.0s)]
*  Let's go to the mall. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=862.0s)]
*  And Colby and I would literally like have my debt like this is before I had a car. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=864.0s)]
*  So my dad would drop us off at the mall. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=868.0s)]
*  And I told him, come pick us up at close. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=870.0s)]
*  And me and Colby would go back and forth and give each other challenges. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=872.0s)]
*  We're like, all right, I'm going to tell you to go do this really horribly embarrassing thing out in front of other people. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=876.0s)]
*  And you either do it or you do 100 push ups. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=881.0s)]
*  And then he'd say yes or no. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=884.0s)]
*  And I was like, OK. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=886.0s)]
*  And then vice versa. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=887.0s)]
*  And we go back and forth. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=888.0s)]
*  And basically, the goal is just to put ourselves out of our comfort zone as much as humanly possible. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=889.0s)]
*  And again, I think the only reason we were able to make this work is because we had like a brand new friendship. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=893.0s)]
*  And so there was part of me that I was like, I can't let this guy think I can't do this. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=898.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=902.0s)]
*  And vice versa. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=903.0s)]
*  And so, yeah, like we were just looking up YouTube videos, like honestly, like as embarrassing as it sounds, like how to pick up girls, how to talk to people, like how to be more social and stuff like that. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=904.0s)]
*  And then we take the things that we learned and then we'd go to the mall and throw ourselves in like the most uncomfortable situations just to like get off our comfort zone and like really take chances and like gross people. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=913.0s)]
*  That's actually very smart. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=922.0s)]
*  That's the way to do it because people are terrified of those interactions with people that make you uncomfortable. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=925.0s)]
*  But if you just like seek them out over and over again, you eventually get comfortable being uncomfortable. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=930.0s)]
*  You used to do it really smart. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=938.0s)]
*  Seeking failure and stuff like that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=939.0s)]
*  Like if you are comfortable with failure, then you can do anything because then you just keep failing, keep failing, keep failing until one day you succeed. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=940.0s)]
*  The problem with failure is a lot of times people let it define them. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=947.0s)]
*  Like they think of themselves as a failure because of not succeeding. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=952.0s)]
*  Instead of thinking yourself as a human being who's learning and growing, you think of yourself like, oh my God, I'm the guy who dropped the ball. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=957.0s)]
*  I'm the guy who crashed the car. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=963.0s)]
*  I'm the guy who did these things. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=965.0s)]
*  I'm the, you know, you think of yourself as a failure. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=967.0s)]
*  I'm the guy who flunked out of school. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=970.0s)]
*  I'm the guy who, you know, the girl broke up with me. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=971.0s)]
*  You start thinking of yourself as like a person who fails. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=974.0s)]
*  You don't think of failure as like, like if you're playing a game and you're learning a game, what you're doing is you're trying to figure out how to be successful. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=980.0s)]
*  But you're still you. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=989.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=990.0s)]
*  You're still the same thing. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=991.0s)]
*  But when you fail enough times, it stains your brain and hurts your feelings so much that you can self-define. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=992.0s)]
*  And then you put parameters and boundaries up and you define yourself as a failure. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1000.0s)]
*  That's what's really dangerous for people. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1008.0s)]
*  That's why you got to get back on the horse. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1009.0s)]
*  That's why people say you fall off the horse, get back on the horse. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1010.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1013.0s)]
*  Which is terrible advice, by the way. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1014.0s)]
*  You fall off a horse, you might fucking die. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1015.0s)]
*  You might break your back a little. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1017.0s)]
*  Yeah, you break your back. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1019.0s)]
*  But that's good that you guys decided to do that because that's a that's a really clever way to deal with the inevitable awkwardness that everybody has when they're young, especially in high school and especially being in Kansas. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1020.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, when we were in like the suburbs of Kansas City. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1034.0s)]
*  So we weren't in like total like cornfield type thing. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1037.0s)]
*  But we definitely were like probably 10 minutes away from like farmland and things like that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1040.0s)]
*  So like Sam was saying, all there was to do out in Kansas were go to the mall on the weekends or we had like a bunch of abandoned places as well. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1044.0s)]
*  So that's like how that ties into later in life. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1051.0s)]
*  Getting into that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1054.0s)]
*  Luckily, you guys had YouTube. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1055.0s)]
*  You know, imagine growing up there in the 70s with no YouTube. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1057.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1060.0s)]
*  You don't get exposed to the rest of the world. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1061.0s)]
*  You have to travel somewhere to find different cultures and different ways that people communicate and just different life experiences. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1063.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1070.0s)]
*  I mean, where we grew up was definitely like a bubble. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1071.0s)]
*  Like us starting to travel was like the best thing ever for our personality and like our understanding of the world. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1073.0s)]
*  Like getting out of Kansas was like, yeah, I have to. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1079.0s)]
*  I talked for a living. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1082.0s)]
*  But when I was younger, I was very awkward. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1083.0s)]
*  And I really had a hard time talking to people like to the point where I get anxiety if I had to go to the bank because I knew that I had to go to the bank teller. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1086.0s)]
*  And I knew how to talk to the teller. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1092.0s)]
*  And I can remember going, what am I fucking scared of? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1093.0s)]
*  Like, why does this bother me so much? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1096.0s)]
*  But I was just scared to just talk to someone who's in a position of power or someone who's, you know, a position of authority. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1098.0s)]
*  It's weird now. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1105.0s)]
*  Can I think about it? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1106.0s)]
*  Because I'm so comfortable talking to people. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1107.0s)]
*  What's weird is I think so many people think that everyone cares. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1109.0s)]
*  But spotlight effect like you are living your world. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1112.0s)]
*  Everyone's living their own world. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1116.0s)]
*  And so they think everything's about them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1118.0s)]
*  Everyone's looking at them. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1119.0s)]
*  But around you, everyone's focusing on themselves. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1120.0s)]
*  People do care if you're weird. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1123.0s)]
*  Like if you're weirded out and you weird them out, like, oh, my God, this guy's freaking out. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1125.0s)]
*  He can't even talk. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1129.0s)]
*  But if you're OK, they're OK. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1130.0s)]
*  It's like people people feed off of other people's energy. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1132.0s)]
*  And it's also those situations where they might think you're like weird in the moment. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1135.0s)]
*  But first of all, why would you want to be friends with that sort of person anyways if you just don't match up? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1139.0s)]
*  And then secondly, like you just don't think about it anymore. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1143.0s)]
*  Like if you were to see somebody do something embarrassing or weird, it's not like you think about somebody else doing that all the time. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1146.0s)]
*  It's like you take account of it and then move on. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1152.0s)]
*  But in your own head, you're like your biggest critique. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1155.0s)]
*  You might think about that every single day. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1157.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. As you go to sleep like a hundred times. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1159.0s)]
*  People forgot about it and you carried around with you forever. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1161.0s)]
*  And that kills you. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1164.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does. It really fucked. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1165.0s)]
*  It really fucks young people up. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1166.0s)]
*  Like you could go the wrong way at an early age and have some bad experiences and those will define you for the rest of your life. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1168.0s)]
*  You'll be 35 years old thinking about something that went wrong when you were 16. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1175.0s)]
*  And that's really common. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1180.0s)]
*  So you guys start out, you're doing these videos where you're just checking out abandoned places. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1181.0s)]
*  And like what was the motive? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1188.0s)]
*  Like you'd wanted to be famous and you're like, well, we'll start making YouTube videos. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1190.0s)]
*  And then like, so how does this get going? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1194.0s)]
*  Yeah. OK. So like backing up just a little bit. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1196.0s)]
*  Like after we learned how to be confident, like we probably went to the mall like when we were 15 for like an entire year. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1198.0s)]
*  So it's like a year boot camp. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1204.0s)]
*  It was literally like a year boot camp. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1206.0s)]
*  Social, social boot camp. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1208.0s)]
*  And we knew we were going to be like best friends because this was like when we truly bonded. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1209.0s)]
*  Like nobody in high school would be down to like go to the mall and be like, hey, you want to go talk to random people? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1213.0s)]
*  Practice social skills? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1218.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1219.0s)]
*  Even like our family, like at some points we're like, what? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1220.0s)]
*  Like I don't understand this. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1223.0s)]
*  But once we learned how to become confident, we felt like, and especially being 16, like we felt like on top of the world, like we could do anything we wanted to. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1224.0s)]
*  And so being a 16 mindset, 16 year old mindset and like having like the social status of us being like the band kids and just always wanted to like fit in and be popular. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1232.0s)]
*  We were just like, well, why don't we, you know, if you YOLO, you only live once as cheesy as that is. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1241.0s)]
*  It's like, why don't we try to become famous in real life? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1246.0s)]
*  And so we started with Vine. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1249.0s)]
*  We started with Vine actually, the six second videos for for a while until it died and then ended up transitioning over to you remember Vine. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1251.0s)]
*  I do remember Vine. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1259.0s)]
*  Didn't Elon Musk talk about doesn't like Twitter own Vine? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1260.0s)]
*  Yeah, they talked about bringing it back, but I don't think they've worked on it in 10 years. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1263.0s)]
*  So it's 10 year old technology. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1266.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's took over. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1268.0s)]
*  It's all tick tock. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1270.0s)]
*  Now, tick tock's way Chinese spyware literally literally like getting your fucking passwords and your location. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1271.0s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1277.0s)]
*  It's terrifying what they can do. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1278.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1280.0s)]
*  It's weird that everybody's just like, whatever. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1281.0s)]
*  I can't give the stuff out of my day. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1283.0s)]
*  It's hugely addictive. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1286.0s)]
*  So you guys start out with these vines and what were the vines about? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1288.0s)]
*  So the vines were basically what we were doing as like our experiments and challenges that we were doing like the last year. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1291.0s)]
*  So it was all public pranks and disturbances like we would get on top of like the food court lunch tables and do like a lightsaber battle or like we get together and do like a flash mob and whatever. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1298.0s)]
*  But then sadly, we got kicked out of the mall because banned from the ban from your training ground. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1308.0s)]
*  It was really sad. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1314.0s)]
*  You got banned from the we can't even come back now. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1315.0s)]
*  Yeah, like we're now 26. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1317.0s)]
*  We are still banned. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1320.0s)]
*  What happened back? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1321.0s)]
*  And they're like, get out of here. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1323.0s)]
*  We were banned for life. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1324.0s)]
*  Yes, we took we took you know how like every school mall has like a seating area like every once in a while or whatever. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1325.0s)]
*  All like the dads like sit on there for a while. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1331.0s)]
*  We ended up like taking one of these couches and like putting it on an escalator and just like riding it up and then just we put it back down. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1333.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1340.0s)]
*  And we were just like really quick video. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1341.0s)]
*  And they just thought we were like stealing the couch. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1343.0s)]
*  And so they sent us like super serious emails like you can never come back. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1345.0s)]
*  Sign this ever. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1349.0s)]
*  Well, this was like the 18th straw after like flash mobs and you know, singing in the courtrooms and stuff like that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1350.0s)]
*  Like they're like, all right, you guys just got to get out of here. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1357.0s)]
*  We're done with your shenanigans. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1360.0s)]
*  Well, you it served its purpose. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1361.0s)]
*  Yeah, it did. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1363.0s)]
*  And so we were like, OK, well, now we can't go to the mall. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1364.0s)]
*  What's the natural natural next step? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1367.0s)]
*  And it's like we were about to graduate high school. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1369.0s)]
*  And so we heard about all the people out in L.A. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1371.0s)]
*  All the collaborators. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1374.0s)]
*  And I don't know if you remember, but there is this like massive apartment building with all the viners that we're all collabing together. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1375.0s)]
*  And we're like, maybe we should go out to L.A. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1381.0s)]
*  So I took a trip out there just for like a week and said, OK, is this the spot to go? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1383.0s)]
*  And we got back and asked our parents like, hey, can we just not go to college and pursue this thing full time? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1387.0s)]
*  And they're like, well, like, why? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1393.0s)]
*  Like, no, like, why don't you do this? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1396.0s)]
*  But then, you know, after talking with them, they're like, OK, main thing we want you guys to be is that you're going to be able to go out there. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1398.0s)]
*  We want you guys to be OK in the financial world or whatever. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1403.0s)]
*  So as long as you can prove to us that you can make money. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1407.0s)]
*  They set a goal of like I think it was like twenty thousand dollars. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1409.0s)]
*  If you guys can make 20 20 grand before you graduate, you can move out and skip a year of college. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1412.0s)]
*  We're like, all right, let's hit the ground running. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1416.0s)]
*  And we just played like the whole like we're doing a gap year sort of thing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1419.0s)]
*  We were just like, listen, mom, if I fail, like I'll go to KU next year. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1423.0s)]
*  Right. Already accepted. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1426.0s)]
*  So let's just try it or whatever. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1428.0s)]
*  Like they had seen this whole journey. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1430.0s)]
*  They saw like our friendship. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1432.0s)]
*  They saw that we had like something going on with like the way we were thinking about stuff. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1433.0s)]
*  And so I think they were just like, we can't really control them. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1437.0s)]
*  Again, a mom just wants you to be financially secure. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1440.0s)]
*  And so like as soon as we were able to prove that they didn't care. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1444.0s)]
*  So this was you guys were still in high school. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1447.0s)]
*  So nice. And how many followers did you have on social media? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1450.0s)]
*  Three hundred. Yeah, maybe like three hundred thousand. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1453.0s)]
*  Well, three hundred thousand's real. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1456.0s)]
*  That's a real number. Yeah. So you were getting some traction. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1458.0s)]
*  It was like on the cusp of like like, you know, L.A. rent is a lot. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1462.0s)]
*  And so like when we were thinking about it, three thousand five thousand dollars to survive out in L.A. per month. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1467.0s)]
*  I don't know if we can actually make that on. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1473.0s)]
*  What do you make on Vine? How did you make money at all on Vine? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1475.0s)]
*  Vine didn't have a monetization platform. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1478.0s)]
*  So it's like so difficult to make money. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1480.0s)]
*  And so we do things like live streaming or every once in a while we get brand deals. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1483.0s)]
*  But a lot of our income came from touring. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1487.0s)]
*  So we didn't really have a onstage talent. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1489.0s)]
*  So but we knew like that was where the money was. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1492.0s)]
*  And so we're like, all right, let's get one, get our names out there by going on tour and to make some money to be able to move out to L.A. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1494.0s)]
*  And so we'd host shows. We'd be like the emcee and like in between acts, we'd come out like, you know, say a stupid story and then like introduce the next act. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1502.0s)]
*  Like what kind of shows are social media shows where it's just like like most talent there were like singers. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1509.0s)]
*  But it was honestly just like a meet and greet for guys like to be honest, like a bunch of girls would come to literally the first one ever was called Mad Con. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1516.0s)]
*  It's just like all these girls will just come and like meet their favorite YouTubers, meet their favorite viners, whatever. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1523.0s)]
*  So we host that. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1528.0s)]
*  These YouTubers and viners would just whatever they did, whether they played guitar or something, they did something so they could do it publicly. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1530.0s)]
*  But people were just there to see them because they were the person from YouTube. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1538.0s)]
*  Pretty much. Yeah. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1540.0s)]
*  And meet them and take pictures and stuff like that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1541.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1543.0s)]
*  And so you guys did that for money for a while. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1546.0s)]
*  Luckily, that ended up working out. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1547.0s)]
*  We didn't get our entire goal, but our family was like, all right, you guys are making money. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1549.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1554.0s)]
*  So three days after high school graduation, we took the road out to Los Angeles without a plan. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1555.0s)]
*  We didn't have we didn't know where we were going to stay. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1560.0s)]
*  We didn't have an apartment. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1562.0s)]
*  We didn't. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1563.0s)]
*  We had like one friend out there. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1564.0s)]
*  And we're just like, let's make this happen, however possible. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1565.0s)]
*  We're going to make it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1568.0s)]
*  Did you find the vine apartment building? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1569.0s)]
*  We ended up the next year. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1571.0s)]
*  The next year we did. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1573.0s)]
*  We ended up living there like the next year. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1574.0s)]
*  But it took a long time because that one was one of the most expensive, expensive apartment buildings in Hollywood. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1576.0s)]
*  So we spent a year like saving up. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1581.0s)]
*  We were like the most stingy people ever. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1584.0s)]
*  Like our friends who want to go out for pizza and we would eat before and work. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1586.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're down to go out, but we'll just sit there with a cup of water because we want to save the all of our furniture was from the dumpster. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1590.0s)]
*  Like we just throw like covers over everything and just like we just live in very, very like we can't spend any money. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1595.0s)]
*  We only had one car out there. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1602.0s)]
*  So it was just grind mode. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1604.0s)]
*  As soon as we got out there, like the difference between like us and a lot of social media kids that do try to make the journey to L.A. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1605.0s)]
*  is we knew we had to like prove ourselves and we knew we had like a year tops. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1610.0s)]
*  And so we were doing everything we could to be like entrepreneurs and start like side businesses and stuff like that. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1615.0s)]
*  Come out with merch, just anything we could do to generate revenue. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1620.0s)]
*  So it starts out with you start doing these vines and then you move to YouTube and was it immediately the abandoned building thing or did you do other stuff? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1624.0s)]
*  We did YouTube like trendy stuff like challenges or whatever. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1633.0s)]
*  We hated the question. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1638.0s)]
*  I answer stuff which we hated. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1639.0s)]
*  Yeah, for like two or three years. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1640.0s)]
*  It was actually when Vine died that we realized, oh, no, like we need to figure something out. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1641.0s)]
*  Like how many subscribers or followers did you have before it died? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1647.0s)]
*  1.7 million. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1651.0s)]
*  Oh, it was happening. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1652.0s)]
*  Yeah, it started again. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1654.0s)]
*  It was getting there, getting there. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1656.0s)]
*  But no money, no monetization. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1657.0s)]
*  So we were like, we have to move this over to YouTube so we can set up AdSense and stuff. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1659.0s)]
*  But the difference between a six second video and a 10 minute long video is a whole different audience. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1663.0s)]
*  Well, how about what you're doing now? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1667.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1669.0s)]
*  You guys are doing like little mini documentaries now. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1670.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1672.0s)]
*  So yeah, the fact that we started on six second videos and now we do like 60 minute long videos is very different. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1673.0s)]
*  It's kind of funny. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1678.0s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1679.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it seems natural. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1680.0s)]
*  Like when you guys do it, it seems natural. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1681.0s)]
*  I told you my daughter's obsessed with you and that's how I found out about it. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1684.0s)]
*  She forced me to watch these videos. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1686.0s)]
*  Forced. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1688.0s)]
*  She did. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1689.0s)]
*  She's like, you've got to see, you've got to see. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1690.0s)]
*  She loves ghosts. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1691.0s)]
*  She's like fascinated by like horror movies and ghosts, which is I wonder if it's genetic. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1693.0s)]
*  I was into that. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1698.0s)]
*  I was into that in a huge way. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1699.0s)]
*  I mean, you see the American War of London out there. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1701.0s)]
*  I mean, I've always been into horror movies and shit. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1702.0s)]
*  I'm like, is this like, did I like get it in her genes somehow or another? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1704.0s)]
*  Because she's she's also an artist too, which I used to do when I was how old is she? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1707.0s)]
*  She's 12. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1711.0s)]
*  OK, gotcha. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1712.0s)]
*  So so she tells me about it and then she makes me watch a bunch of the videos and I'm like, how do these guys get started? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1713.0s)]
*  Like how does this how does this happen where you get to the point where now you're ghost investigators? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1719.0s)]
*  What's crazy is like we never envisioned ourselves that like we had a really like deep seeded interest in like the abandoned and like, you know, that was the only thing to do in Kansas. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1725.0s)]
*  So we like spent most of our friendship in high school exploring abandoned places or creepy buildings or haunted houses. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1736.0s)]
*  And so were you in these abandoned buildings? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1742.0s)]
*  Were you like going over the history of this place? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1744.0s)]
*  Like this used to be a factory or this used to be a school or back in the abandoned days, it was different. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1746.0s)]
*  Again, we were trying to find ourselves on YouTube. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1752.0s)]
*  And so the best thing for us was just to be like genuinely excited about something because we'd be doing these couch videos, doing these challenges and just hating what we were filming. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1754.0s)]
*  And so just capturing like so a lot of like what was already existing on YouTube at that time with abandon was like more documentary style where people would like start their video inside the place and then just have like a very slow paced. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1763.0s)]
*  Like this is what it's all about. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1777.0s)]
*  And then goodbye. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1778.0s)]
*  But what Sam and I wanted to do was like film the adrenaline side of it, like film us running up to the place, hiding from the guards, like hiding from police. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1780.0s)]
*  We don't break into these places. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1787.0s)]
*  We don't like vandalize anything but like sneak again, like all like the adventure part of it. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1789.0s)]
*  So we were more adventure less like history of it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1793.0s)]
*  Yeah. When we started, did you guys get in trouble from any of these? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1796.0s)]
*  I mean, a lot like well, and even in Kansas, like when we first started, what we realized is, you know, being young looking kids that are doing this and like we kind of got better and better at it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1799.0s)]
*  Like we figured out, OK, we can talk our way out of the cops like every once in a while. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1810.0s)]
*  And that definitely happened. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1813.0s)]
*  And I think at that point, we were just like, we find it so much more interesting to have that sort of fear of we will get caught because no one else is doing that. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1814.0s)]
*  Imagine seeing someone actually putting, you know, crime on the line. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1823.0s)]
*  Minor crime. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1828.0s)]
*  Minor crime. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1829.0s)]
*  Trespassing. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1830.0s)]
*  Trespassing for sure. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1831.0s)]
*  A little bit of trespassing. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1832.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1833.0s)]
*  But we got arrested eventually. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1834.0s)]
*  Did you? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1835.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1836.0s)]
*  Where did you guys get arrested? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1837.0s)]
*  Tampa, Florida. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1838.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1839.0s)]
*  Which is our first mistake. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1840.0s)]
*  Did you get thrown into the hooch? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1841.0s)]
*  Like into the lockdown with everybody? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1842.0s)]
*  I did for 24 hours. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1845.0s)]
*  Sam didn't because this is so stupid. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1847.0s)]
*  You got locked in for 24 hours? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1849.0s)]
*  Like a little less than that. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1851.0s)]
*  Probably like 20 hours or so. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1852.0s)]
*  But I had to stay overnight in the jail while Sam was able to like bail himself out. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1853.0s)]
*  But pretty much. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1857.0s)]
*  We did a lot of like, you know, we did a lot of trespassing. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1859.0s)]
*  Trespassing is not is usually like a fine, like, you know, seventy five bucks or something like that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1862.0s)]
*  Depending on the state. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1867.0s)]
*  But sadly, this particular location was under construction and apparently construction properties are government properties. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1868.0s)]
*  In Florida. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1876.0s)]
*  In Florida. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1877.0s)]
*  And so they charged us with a felony. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1878.0s)]
*  A felony. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1880.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1881.0s)]
*  And it was really strange because when we got arrested, there was like eight cops that showed up to the scene with dogs and everything. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1882.0s)]
*  That's why we got out of the place, by the way. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1888.0s)]
*  And they, like the deputies were super nice to us. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1891.0s)]
*  It was the sheriff that was like, oh, these are YouTubers. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1895.0s)]
*  We have to make an example. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1897.0s)]
*  And I had two fake IDs from when I was 20 trying to get into the bars, like still stuck in my wallet. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1899.0s)]
*  Super stupid. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1904.0s)]
*  Like no reason for that at all. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1906.0s)]
*  Just a dumb move. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1907.0s)]
*  And so I had three felonies and it made me not able to be able to bail myself out. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1909.0s)]
*  They cap it at like five five thousand and each felony is two thousand bail. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1914.0s)]
*  And so I had six thousand. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1919.0s)]
*  So I had to wait for Sam to bail himself out so he could bail me out. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1921.0s)]
*  So I got taken back. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1925.0s)]
*  Felonies. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1927.0s)]
*  So how did how did it play out? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1928.0s)]
*  I ended up bailing myself out. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1931.0s)]
*  So I think I was only in there for like seven, eight hours. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1933.0s)]
*  And then I went to go work on his bail outside. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1936.0s)]
*  But you had a horrible time. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1938.0s)]
*  I had a great time in jail. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1940.0s)]
*  Did you have fun? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1942.0s)]
*  It was sick. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1943.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1944.0s)]
*  I wasn't expecting it to be like a good experience. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1945.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's funny because like we arrive and oh my gosh, all like our viewers and stuff make fun of us for this. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1948.0s)]
*  But that day, like I decided randomly just to like rock like a Justin Bieber like merch shirt. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1955.0s)]
*  So I'm like coming in here looking like a teeny bop like emo kid Justin Bieber shirt, like piercings and stuff like that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1960.0s)]
*  And like everybody's like turning their heads and I'm like, oh, this is when I die. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1967.0s)]
*  Like I'm gonna die here. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1970.0s)]
*  But they took out like all my piercings and stuff like that. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1972.0s)]
*  I said goodbye to Sam like we were in like a big waiting room. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1974.0s)]
*  And so when they brought me to the back, the first night was I only stayed there for one night. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1977.0s)]
*  But like that night was super scary. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1982.0s)]
*  But for the rest of the time, like long story short, like I got moved to another pod like a felon pod because I had three under my name. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1984.0s)]
*  And I asked the deputy. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1992.0s)]
*  He was super nice and he could like see that I was like uncomfortable being there, of course. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1995.0s)]
*  And I was just like, what should I do? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=1999.0s)]
*  He said, dude, honestly, I would just go grab a book, go to your cell and just like lay low. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2000.0s)]
*  Sam's going to bail you out very soon. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2004.0s)]
*  I said, OK, that sounds like a plan. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2006.0s)]
*  So I didn't talk to anybody else trying to like mean mug and like be like serious the entire time. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2008.0s)]
*  Grabbed a book, went to like my cell and just stayed in there. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2012.0s)]
*  And then like 20 minutes later, I'm like reading my book. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2016.0s)]
*  I hear the door start to jiggle. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2019.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, this is when I die. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2021.0s)]
*  I'm about to meet my cellmate. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2023.0s)]
*  He comes in like super scary looking guy. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2025.0s)]
*  I'm like freaked out at first, but he just turned out to be the nicest guy ever. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2028.0s)]
*  Like he was like, what are you in for? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2033.0s)]
*  He's like, this is what I'm doing. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2035.0s)]
*  And like he asked about YouTube and told him like why like we do what we do and all that stuff. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2036.0s)]
*  And I'm in for murder. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2040.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2042.0s)]
*  What was he in for? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2043.0s)]
*  He said it was like it was something with like drug smuggling cocaine somewhere. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2044.0s)]
*  Oh, gee. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2048.0s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2049.0s)]
*  Real. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2050.0s)]
*  I trespassed. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2051.0s)]
*  I trespassed for you to. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2052.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I didn't want to say anything about it. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2054.0s)]
*  These guys are going to think I'm like the biggest pussy in the world. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2057.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2060.0s)]
*  That's probably better, though. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2061.0s)]
*  That way, you know, they don't think you're a threat. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2062.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2064.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2065.0s)]
*  But we had a conversation for literally like an hour and like shot the shit and he, you [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2066.0s)]
*  know, broke down each other's walls and stuff. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2070.0s)]
*  And he was becoming like a friend, actually. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2072.0s)]
*  And then he was like, well, I'm going to go back out to the pod because there's like a [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2074.0s)]
*  main area where everybody can like hang out where there's like basketball and places you [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2077.0s)]
*  can watch TV and stuff like that. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2081.0s)]
*  And I was like, OK, I'm probably just going to chill here. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2083.0s)]
*  And he was like, no, no, you should really come with me. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2085.0s)]
*  Like, I have a lot of friends in here. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2087.0s)]
*  I've been in here for like a few months. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2089.0s)]
*  And so I was like, all right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2091.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2093.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2094.0s)]
*  And so this guy, I just took a chance with this situation with this guy, like took me [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2095.0s)]
*  under his wing, like introduced me to like all of his friends in jail. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2099.0s)]
*  And we played like basketball and made a friend group. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2103.0s)]
*  Literally like they were all asking about like YouTube and all that stuff. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2106.0s)]
*  And then Sam bailed me out like three hours later. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2110.0s)]
*  Did you stay in touch with him at all? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2113.0s)]
*  No, no, I told him to DM me afterwards. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2115.0s)]
*  But of course, like just couldn't find it. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2118.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know how long he was because we were in jail, not like prison. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2120.0s)]
*  Right. So he was still awaiting his trial because he couldn't even like bail himself out. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2124.0s)]
*  So who knows if he even got even more time? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2128.0s)]
*  Like, I don't even know. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2131.0s)]
*  It sounds like it. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2132.0s)]
*  If probably selling cocaine. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2133.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or like carrying large amounts. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2135.0s)]
*  I don't know. But yeah, haven't heard from him. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2137.0s)]
*  Absolutely crazy, though, is that morning, like we had no idea. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2139.0s)]
*  All right. This is just a casual day. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2143.0s)]
*  We always do these like abandoned videos and then we'll just work on editing them or whatever. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2145.0s)]
*  Anyway, I walk out. I don't have my phone because they take all that stuff. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2149.0s)]
*  And our buddy who is going to help us drive us home or whatever, he comes in. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2152.0s)]
*  He's like, do you know what's going on? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2157.0s)]
*  We're like, no. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2159.0s)]
*  He's like, for the past like 12 hours, you guys have been number one worldwide trending. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2160.0s)]
*  Free Sam and Colby. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2166.0s)]
*  Huge. Huge. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2167.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm walking out. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2169.0s)]
*  Like he's starting to interrupt, but like the deputy's bringing me out being like, Sam finally bailed you out. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2170.0s)]
*  He was like, but what's your name, by the way? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2175.0s)]
*  And I was like, Cole Brock. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2176.0s)]
*  He was just like, I've had thousands of girls call this jail to try to bail you out. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2178.0s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2183.0s)]
*  And then as I'm leaving, there's fans outside. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2184.0s)]
*  It's like a meet and greet like outside, like fans waiting for me. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2187.0s)]
*  How many fans? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2189.0s)]
*  It was like three or four. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2190.0s)]
*  So it wasn't like a like a huge thing. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2192.0s)]
*  It was people that figured out like where the jail was itself. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2194.0s)]
*  A lot of people were calling, but it was so interesting because we never would have thought that that was going to be the big start. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2198.0s)]
*  But from that night and getting arrested, it completely blew up and changed our career. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2205.0s)]
*  It was so weird. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2211.0s)]
*  And in terms of numbers, just so you know, like we were getting on the abandoned videos like a little less than a million. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2212.0s)]
*  So like 700, 800 K, which we were very happy with. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2217.0s)]
*  But after we got arrested, we knew we couldn't do like the illegal stuff anymore. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2220.0s)]
*  And so while during the abandoned days, we can get to the story in a second, but like we went to the Queen Mary and had our first haunted experience ever. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2224.0s)]
*  And so it just made sense to us that like, well, this is a legal thing we could just do at hotels and stuff. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2232.0s)]
*  Why not just do like the haunted haunted instead? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2237.0s)]
*  How much did the numbers change? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2240.0s)]
*  Up to like like three, like two million, three, three to four million, like the first one. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2242.0s)]
*  And then they just kept growing from there. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2246.0s)]
*  So millions after. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2248.0s)]
*  So tell me about the Queen Mary. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2249.0s)]
*  That's the beginning for you guys. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2251.0s)]
*  That's the number one origin. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2253.0s)]
*  You went there to do what? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2254.0s)]
*  So what was really interesting is we did a lot of the abandoned stuff. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2256.0s)]
*  But every once in a while we would do like a haunted thing because those creepy stories and you know, the lore of everything is really interesting. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2261.0s)]
*  Whether or not you believe it or not. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2268.0s)]
*  At that time, we didn't really believe in any of the ghost stuff. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2269.0s)]
*  We're like, all right, this is gonna be a great video because everyone loves telling the stories. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2272.0s)]
*  But we just got I don't know what it was, but someone forwarded us something saying that for the first time in 30 years, the Queen Mary in Long Beach, which is like one of the most haunted ships like New York Times, like top 10 most haunted places in the world. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2276.0s)]
*  We filmed Fear Factor there once. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2290.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah, that's great. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2292.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful ship. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2293.0s)]
*  They do a comedy show there sometimes. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2295.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2296.0s)]
*  Yeah, for a while they had a regular comedy night there on the Queen Mary. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2297.0s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't realize how like famous it was, but they have that. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2300.0s)]
*  They have like haunted houses. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2303.0s)]
*  They have a ton of different attractions there. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2304.0s)]
*  But there's this one room, B340, that hadn't been open for 30 years and allegedly they closed it down because there's multiple unexplained murders and or suicides in that room. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2306.0s)]
*  And we're like, whoa, like, you know, this is the first week this is open after 30 years. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2319.0s)]
*  This is going to be an amazing story to tell or, you know, video film. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2324.0s)]
*  And so we went in there trying to make something or trying to get something. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2327.0s)]
*  We obviously didn't really believe that much. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2331.0s)]
*  So we're like, all right, let's just see if that happens. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2333.0s)]
*  If there's going to be a haunted location, it will be this. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2335.0s)]
*  We toured around, did the whole thing, weren't getting much. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2338.0s)]
*  And we're kind of frustrated at that point because we're like, all right, this is supposed to be the cream of the crop. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2343.0s)]
*  This is supposed to be the big big wig. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2347.0s)]
*  Like, why can't we get something to happen? [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2348.0s)]
*  And so it was four o'clock in the morning at this time. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2350.0s)]
*  We've been trying for hours of just sitting in circles, like asking out. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2354.0s)]
*  We didn't have any equipment at this time. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2358.0s)]
*  This is like the first place we ever went to. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2359.0s)]
*  So we were just like meandering like the hallways being like, is anything here? [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2361.0s)]
*  Yeah, like just trying to get something to happen on camera and nothing was happening. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2365.0s)]
*  And so we're like, fine, I guess let's do this. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2370.0s)]
*  Let's just like leave. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2373.0s)]
*  Like, it's fun to tell the story. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2374.0s)]
*  Let's just leave. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2375.0s)]
*  And so we turn off the camera, start packing up, we walk like start walking towards the door. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2376.0s)]
*  And as soon as we turn, like actually we're about to like get out of the room, the faucet turns on like full blast for four seconds and then turns back off. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2380.0s)]
*  And we all like actually like, you know, freeze and freak out. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2388.0s)]
*  Two of our roommates that were there at the time, like just immediately started crying. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2391.0s)]
*  We were like we ran in. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2395.0s)]
*  We were like, OK, how was that actually possible at all? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2396.0s)]
*  Maybe that's a sign of like it doesn't want to be filmed and it doesn't want us to leave. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2399.0s)]
*  So maybe let's just not not film this and try one more time just for the just for the heck of it. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2403.0s)]
*  And so that's what we did. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2408.0s)]
*  But this time it worked. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2410.0s)]
*  And to like the weirdest extent, we just like put put away all of our cameras. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2411.0s)]
*  We sat in the most serious tone saying like, OK, guys, like before this didn't really believe. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2417.0s)]
*  So like if this is happening, let's let's have something happen. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2422.0s)]
*  And so we all sit in the dark together and we start calling out questions and we're like, OK, like, is there anybody here? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2425.0s)]
*  We hear a knock. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2431.0s)]
*  And so we're like, OK, maybe that's something very faint, though. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2433.0s)]
*  It was like a tap like a tap. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2436.0s)]
*  And so, OK, let's just run with that. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2438.0s)]
*  Can you tap more than once? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2440.0s)]
*  And there was like three taps. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2441.0s)]
*  OK, this is really weird. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2443.0s)]
*  Like, can we start asking questions? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2445.0s)]
*  And how loud are you saying this? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2447.0s)]
*  Like, is it possible that someone could have heard you from another room? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2449.0s)]
*  That's what we thought. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2451.0s)]
*  So going like we're talking probably like this. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2452.0s)]
*  But then there was times we talked like really quiet and like we tested everything. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2456.0s)]
*  But so what we did is we decided let's ask questions using these taps. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2460.0s)]
*  So we said tap once for yes. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2464.0s)]
*  Tap anything more than once for no. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2468.0s)]
*  We had a yes or no conversation for 35 minutes with something that we cannot explain. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2471.0s)]
*  And we did everything because we were skeptical. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2476.0s)]
*  Did you feel any of this? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2479.0s)]
*  We didn't think so. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2480.0s)]
*  But apparently one of our friends, he's like super religious, was like, hey, no matter what the entire night he was keeping an audio recording. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2482.0s)]
*  We had no idea. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2490.0s)]
*  We had no idea he was doing that. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2491.0s)]
*  So nobody talked about it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2492.0s)]
*  So if there was something there, no, it didn't know either. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2493.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had no idea. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2497.0s)]
*  He had pulled that out. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2498.0s)]
*  We genuinely were like, OK, no one's film. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2499.0s)]
*  We even say in this audio recording, like no one's filming this. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2501.0s)]
*  No bullshit. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2504.0s)]
*  Like everyone, please, like be serious about this. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2505.0s)]
*  And so we had this conversation back and forth and we tried to trick it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2508.0s)]
*  You know, like we would ask questions in different manners like, OK, is there more than one of you? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2511.0s)]
*  Yes. And then we'd say, are you alone? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2516.0s)]
*  And it would say no. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2518.0s)]
*  Back and forth trying to get this thing. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2519.0s)]
*  And this story kept straight the entire time. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2521.0s)]
*  And we were like, come on, there could be someone like screwing with us. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2523.0s)]
*  Like on, you know, the news of being like haunted place, like what's going on? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2526.0s)]
*  What was crazy about it, too, is all the knocks. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2530.0s)]
*  They weren't just coming from one one section. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2532.0s)]
*  That would make sense if like maybe something outside was like tapping. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2534.0s)]
*  These knocks would be like below us and then above us to our sides. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2538.0s)]
*  Some would be louder than other ones. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2543.0s)]
*  We went out to the hallway a couple of times and we realized that we were like the last room besides like this like utility room to our left. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2545.0s)]
*  And obviously we had like basically that whole floor to ourselves as well, since it was super late. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2553.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then like sometime in the middle, we were like, OK, like, let's like ask a question under a breath. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2559.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like, OK. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2565.0s)]
*  Like this this thing does not want us to leave. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2567.0s)]
*  And at that moment, the entire floor shook. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2571.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2574.0s)]
*  Like we were like, oh, my God, what was that? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2575.0s)]
*  You can feel the vibration in your feet. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2577.0s)]
*  Crashing on the ship or something was huge. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2579.0s)]
*  And so we're like, OK, so this thing doesn't want us to leave. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2581.0s)]
*  Maybe we should just like ask questions under our breath for the rest of the time, just so we know it's not some employees, not someone like screwing with us the entire time. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2583.0s)]
*  So fast fast fast forward to the very end. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2591.0s)]
*  We were like, OK, we've had a bunch of conversations at this point. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2594.0s)]
*  We really believe if this is truly something I want to know something about something deeper than just yes or no questions or or just like something silly of like how many people are here. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2598.0s)]
*  So I decided let's ask about religion. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2607.0s)]
*  And I ask out, is there a heaven? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2612.0s)]
*  And it knocks three times, meaning no. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2616.0s)]
*  And at that point, our two religious friends that were there like immediately jumped up and said, we have to leave right now. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2619.0s)]
*  We had no idea why. Why? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2624.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2626.0s)]
*  Like, I'll tell you in the car, like, dude, like, just don't look back. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2627.0s)]
*  Let's go. Let's leave. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2629.0s)]
*  And so we walked out. We left. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2630.0s)]
*  We got all the way to the car without anyone saying anything. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2632.0s)]
*  And as soon as we got in the car, we're like, what's going on? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2634.0s)]
*  Like, why do we have to leave? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2636.0s)]
*  He's like, well, in the Christian religion, the anything like demonic or evil is supposed to like basically disprove that there is a heaven. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2637.0s)]
*  You know, and so what they're saying is like, we don't think this is some like spirit or something paranormal there. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2649.0s)]
*  We think it was something that was trying to lead you away from heaven. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2655.0s)]
*  Demonic territory type thing. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2660.0s)]
*  But that also just depends on what you believe in. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2662.0s)]
*  Obviously, like our roommates were very, very Christian, very religious. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2664.0s)]
*  And so when they heard the knocks saying no, they thought it was just kind of like a sign from like a demon to like steer us away from from God saying like this does not exist. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2667.0s)]
*  And so they without question ran before we could even like we kind of were wanting to stay there to ask more things. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2677.0s)]
*  It was really interesting because this is your first experience for anything paranormal. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2684.0s)]
*  Well, first, very believable one. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2688.0s)]
*  There has been plenty of times where we hear things or like, you know, things are scary in like the abandoned places, but they're also decrepit old places. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2691.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2699.0s)]
*  Freak and stuff. Yeah. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2700.0s)]
*  Old dark places make you freak out. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2701.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2703.0s)]
*  This is the first conversation we should say that we've had. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2704.0s)]
*  So up until that point, did you believe in ghosts before? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2707.0s)]
*  And like, what is it? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2712.0s)]
*  What is the feeling like when you have to sort of process the end of that day? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2713.0s)]
*  So that was a monumental change in not only like our career, but also like our at least my like thought process in life, because yes, I had the idea that maybe something else something else is out there. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2716.0s)]
*  I had grown up a Christian. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2729.0s)]
*  But at that time, we had gone to so many scary places. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2731.0s)]
*  We, you know, tackled a bunch of like life questions, philosophical questions throughout our time together. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2734.0s)]
*  And we're like, OK, like after asking about it, like for me, I was like losing like faith and something else. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2739.0s)]
*  I was like, OK, maybe maybe we're just the only things out here. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2745.0s)]
*  And after that moment, I had like a full on like breakdown the next day. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2748.0s)]
*  Like I like I was like everything that I had thought was not real now becomes real. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2754.0s)]
*  And I had like pretty much lost any any sort of like faith at that point. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2759.0s)]
*  But there is even a video of me online like sitting on my bedroom floor, like crying to camera saying I truly didn't believe. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2763.0s)]
*  And now this instance opens up this whole world. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2769.0s)]
*  Like maybe I don't immediately believe 100 percent. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2772.0s)]
*  But the question of if there is something else out there is now back in my brain. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2775.0s)]
*  And I want to chase that. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2779.0s)]
*  And so after the whole arrest and going to the Honda stuff, that was like it wasn't necessarily we were like a thousand percent believers the second we like had this experience. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2781.0s)]
*  But it was so intriguing because it was one of those things that we couldn't explain. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2790.0s)]
*  We told this story so many times. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2793.0s)]
*  And the audio of this actually happening, the Knox is online. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2795.0s)]
*  So many people don't believe it because they weren't there. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2799.0s)]
*  And we wouldn't believe it if we weren't there. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2801.0s)]
*  And so we understand that people don't believe us when we talk about these things. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2803.0s)]
*  However, just the idea that it could be real and the idea that could happen again is what's so intriguing and is why we got into it. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2807.0s)]
*  We're like, OK, if we can just keep doing this and keep getting more and more proof like that feeling of hope of like, OK, there is something else out there. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2816.0s)]
*  And it is not just, OK, we're going to live and die here on the planet. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2823.0s)]
*  It's so special. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2827.0s)]
*  No matter what you believe in, no matter what religion you have, it's like we realize that that experience for us, it taught us that there is something else. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2828.0s)]
*  It's more spiritual than anything. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2836.0s)]
*  And we wanted to spread that message as well to as many people as possible, again, no matter what they believed in. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2838.0s)]
*  But your roommates thought it was demonic. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2845.0s)]
*  They were they took like the Christian route. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2847.0s)]
*  And that's again, that's up to whoever is viewing this or experiencing it themselves. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2849.0s)]
*  But, yeah, they they took it very religiously. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2854.0s)]
*  How did you feel? Did you feel like it was a demon or did you feel like it was a ghost or dead people? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2856.0s)]
*  What do you think it was? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2861.0s)]
*  I don't know. At the time, I definitely thought it was a demon because these two guys are like yelling at me. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2862.0s)]
*  Freaking out. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2867.0s)]
*  Dude, this is 100 percent without a shout of a doubt, like a demon. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2868.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know exactly what I believe in. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2871.0s)]
*  Like this is already like rattling my brain right now. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2873.0s)]
*  But it was scary. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2877.0s)]
*  And what was scarier is trying to go back into it and repeating the process. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2878.0s)]
*  Because like we didn't know what we were messing with. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2884.0s)]
*  If it was a demon like hell, maybe if it is all real, are we just screwing ourselves over by like going and inviting that thing into your life? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2885.0s)]
*  How many times do you guys go to the Queen Mary? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2895.0s)]
*  Three, four times. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2897.0s)]
*  Yeah, three or four times. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2899.0s)]
*  So you went back after that? [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2900.0s)]
*  We did. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2901.0s)]
*  Did you leave the roommates at home? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2902.0s)]
*  At that point? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2905.0s)]
*  Yeah, we did. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2906.0s)]
*  Like our final step, which was actually last year, we hadn't gone back in three years, but we wanted to like the Queen Mary actually shut down. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2907.0s)]
*  Which was sad. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2913.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2914.0s)]
*  When was that? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2915.0s)]
*  Last year. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2916.0s)]
*  They lost like funding and whatever. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2917.0s)]
*  They might be opening up now. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2919.0s)]
*  They're trying to like raise money and like get it back up. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2921.0s)]
*  So we thought this was the last time we'd ever see the ship. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2924.0s)]
*  So we're like, let's go say goodbye to the thing that literally started this whole adventure for us. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2926.0s)]
*  And so Colby and I went back alone. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2931.0s)]
*  Same room? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2933.0s)]
*  B340. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2934.0s)]
*  Same room, alone, like repeating. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2935.0s)]
*  Do they rent that room out to anybody? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2936.0s)]
*  They do now. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2938.0s)]
*  They do now. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2939.0s)]
*  But for 30 years they didn't. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2940.0s)]
*  For 30 years. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2941.0s)]
*  We were like the first people to get to it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2942.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2944.0s)]
*  After 30 years. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2945.0s)]
*  But again, that's all alleged as well. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2946.0s)]
*  Like who knows if it's like a marketing ploy. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2947.0s)]
*  And again, we were so skeptical that like Sam and I, when those knocks first started to happen, like we were like looking under things. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2949.0s)]
*  We were like, this room has to be bugged. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2955.0s)]
*  See if you can find anything about that room. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2956.0s)]
*  Find anything about the Queen Mary. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2958.0s)]
*  Outside of what they have. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2960.0s)]
*  Room 340. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2961.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's B340. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2962.0s)]
*  B340. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2963.0s)]
*  So they told you that there was multiple murders that took place in that room? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2964.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2968.0s)]
*  I imagine you guys were just like an hour away from killing your roommates. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2969.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2972.0s)]
*  Yeah, like if we kept going at it. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2973.0s)]
*  One more hour. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2974.0s)]
*  Kept asking questions. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2975.0s)]
*  He just turns on us. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2976.0s)]
*  Bam. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2977.0s)]
*  It just starts talking to you. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2978.0s)]
*  That's what the room looks like. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2979.0s)]
*  This is the room. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2980.0s)]
*  Oh god, it gives you chills. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2981.0s)]
*  What does it say on the wall? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2982.0s)]
*  So you can scripture? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2984.0s)]
*  Well, they have literally experiences of each like different family. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2985.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a ton of... [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2989.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2990.0s)]
*  So it's like openly haunted. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2991.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2993.0s)]
*  So anytime someone has like a crazy experience that they deem notable, they'll write it on the wall. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2994.0s)]
*  There's our thumbnail right there. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2998.0s)]
*  Oh, there's our thumbnail right there. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=2999.0s)]
*  That's the Bloody Mary wall. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3000.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they have instructions to do Bloody Mary. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3002.0s)]
*  It's definitely cheesy a little bit. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3004.0s)]
*  Like they have the Bloody Mary like challenge on it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3005.0s)]
*  Bloody Mary? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3008.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3009.0s)]
*  So Bloody Mary is like this challenge that a lot of people used to do like as like children [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3010.0s)]
*  or whatever. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3014.0s)]
*  You like go in front of a mirror, turn the light off, have one candle, spin around three [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3015.0s)]
*  times while saying Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3019.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's Candyman. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3021.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3022.0s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3023.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3024.0s)]
*  So it's the evolution of Candyman. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3026.0s)]
*  And so that's like gimmicky, obviously, but there's a lot of stories all over the... [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3027.0s)]
*  That's the one that turned on, yeah. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3031.0s)]
*  And so this room, is there any documentation that people actually died in that room? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3033.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say, I'm curious because like when we went there, again, like we were [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3038.0s)]
*  very different than where we're at now. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3043.0s)]
*  Like we didn't do like super extensive research. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3045.0s)]
*  What we did is we like would, you know, we'd take the article that it says it is, but obviously [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3047.0s)]
*  we're not going back and fact checking that. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3052.0s)]
*  And then we'd go and talk to the employees. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3054.0s)]
*  And so most of our stories were all like firsthand encounters with the employees that were there [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3056.0s)]
*  or things that they would tell us rather than, you know... [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3060.0s)]
*  And the employees seemed to believe it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3063.0s)]
*  Every employee like we've met pretty much at all these haunted places are true believers. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3065.0s)]
*  Those are the ones that said like they could see stuff following us. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3070.0s)]
*  So yeah, people that work there like are super into like the paranormal and stuff. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3073.0s)]
*  That's what's fucked, right? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3077.0s)]
*  Because there's only a handful of those people that are there day in, day out. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3079.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3083.0s)]
*  Like, and you can dismiss that. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3084.0s)]
*  Or it's like... [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3086.0s)]
*  Or it might be real. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3087.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3089.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3090.0s)]
*  It's just the thing that gnaws at me. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3091.0s)]
*  It's like it's so easy to dismiss ghosts. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3092.0s)]
*  Oh, ghosts are bullshit. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3094.0s)]
*  But the problem is there are so many people that say they've seen it over so many years, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3096.0s)]
*  literally hundreds and hundreds of years. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3103.0s)]
*  It makes you wonder. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3107.0s)]
*  If there are multiple dimensions and if life is... [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3108.0s)]
*  If you are a physical body that's carrying around a soul, like where does that thing go? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3112.0s)]
*  Yeah, energy doesn't die. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3120.0s)]
*  Where does it all go? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3121.0s)]
*  And what happens if something horrible takes place? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3122.0s)]
*  Like there's some crazy traumatic moment, gunshots and stab wounds and... [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3125.0s)]
*  Like where does that soul go? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3131.0s)]
*  Is it possible that things get trapped in between? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3133.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3137.0s)]
*  In between worlds? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3138.0s)]
*  And that these people that work in these places are you guys. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3139.0s)]
*  Or us. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3143.0s)]
*  Experience. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3144.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3145.0s)]
*  And who's to say, like, you know, we know, like, you know, whether or not maybe a lot [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3146.0s)]
*  of people believe the soul passes on, but what if that's just not true and all souls [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3150.0s)]
*  stay here? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3153.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3154.0s)]
*  Like, it's so interesting. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3155.0s)]
*  We'd be God if we knew, you know. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3156.0s)]
*  It's just, it's a lot of guesswork. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3157.0s)]
*  But the thing about the ghost stuff is there's so many people with experiences. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3159.0s)]
*  My grandmother was, she would always say she was psychic, but she'd never guessed [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3163.0s)]
*  anything correctly. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3168.0s)]
*  Outlandish. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3169.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3170.0s)]
*  But she always like, there was a guy that was staying with them for a while. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3171.0s)]
*  After my parents, my mom and my uncles moved out of the house, they took in like a board, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3177.0s)]
*  a boarder, like a guy that my father knew. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3185.0s)]
*  And, you know, he paid them to stay in one of the rooms. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3187.0s)]
*  And he was up in the attic and they had like the attic set up as an apartment and he died. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3190.0s)]
*  And my grandmother used to go up there and she said sometimes he would talk to her. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3196.0s)]
*  Like, she would have these experiences where she's like, I know he's still up there. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3201.0s)]
*  Like, he was talking to me. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3206.0s)]
*  And my grandfather got kind of fucking weirded out by it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3207.0s)]
*  But it was like, she, she told us don't go up in that attic. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3210.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3215.0s)]
*  Did she ever tell you like what he would talk about? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3216.0s)]
*  Like, full on conversations or not? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3217.0s)]
*  No, it was hard. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3219.0s)]
*  I was very young at the time, so I don't think she wanted to freak me out. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3220.0s)]
*  I was like five years old. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3223.0s)]
*  So I think she wanted to keep it on the DL. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3224.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3226.0s)]
*  It was, my grandmother was crazy. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3227.0s)]
*  She had a monkey. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3229.0s)]
*  She had a monkey named Chi Chi that would bite people. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3230.0s)]
*  What? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3233.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3234.0s)]
*  What? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3235.0s)]
*  My grandmother was nuts. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3236.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was a wild lady. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3237.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3239.0s)]
*  She went to jail for bookmaking. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3240.0s)]
*  Bookmaking? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3241.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was running numbers for the mob. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3242.0s)]
*  And she wouldn't give up the mob until they put her in jail for six months. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3244.0s)]
*  So it would always be like, where's grandma? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3248.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, grandma's staying with Aunt Lulu. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3250.0s)]
*  Just not talk about it for a while. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3253.0s)]
*  She was in fucking jail. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3255.0s)]
*  She was in jail for numbers running. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3256.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3259.0s)]
*  Because they had like, that was like the neighborhood lottery was the numbers. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3260.0s)]
*  And that's how, do you know what the numbers were? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3264.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3266.0s)]
*  See, we can find like a definition of the numbers, like how the mob used to run the numbers. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3267.0s)]
*  But like basically they would have a number every day, you know, like 34, 29, 16, whatever it was. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3272.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know how many digits it was. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3277.0s)]
*  And people would guess whatever the number was and you'd pay into that, whatever it was. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3280.0s)]
*  So you'd pay in, I don't know how much money it cost to for each individual thing, but it was very similar to the lottery. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3286.0s)]
*  Like the lottery numbers, they picked the lottery numbers, you guess them, and you could buy as many lottery tickets as you want. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3293.0s)]
*  It's similar to that. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3300.0s)]
*  But it was all illegal and it wasn't being taxed. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3302.0s)]
*  And you know, you could get in real trouble if you were involved in it. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3305.0s)]
*  And so my grandmother was involved in it. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3308.0s)]
*  So they arrested her. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3310.0s)]
*  But what they really wanted is her to rat out the mob. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3311.0s)]
*  And she's like, I'm not ratting out nobody. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3314.0s)]
*  That's kind of awesome. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3316.0s)]
*  She went to jail for six months. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3317.0s)]
*  Sheesh. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3319.0s)]
*  Trust her at first. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3320.0s)]
*  But she also talked to ghosts. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3321.0s)]
*  There we go. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3323.0s)]
*  Same category. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3324.0s)]
*  No, it's interesting. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3325.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of people dismiss that idea, but I think it's like 50 percent of the United States or something like that, like believes in it, believes in ghosts and believes in the afterlife or something like that. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3326.0s)]
*  It's like everybody you talk to, like, we'll have something where maybe it's not paranormal, but they'll have like a situation that they can't explain. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3342.0s)]
*  They don't know how like the drape fell off like in the beginning. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3343.0s)]
*  You know, it's weird enough that we're here. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3347.0s)]
*  That's weird enough. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3349.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3350.0s)]
*  The idea that like there's ghosts, somehow that's weirder. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3351.0s)]
*  Like just human life is fucking bizarre. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3356.0s)]
*  Just the fact that we can look at each other and communicate and you use sounds to express feelings and move without thinking about it. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3359.0s)]
*  There's a lot of weirdness to life that we just take for granted because it's commonplace. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3367.0s)]
*  But the ghost thing, you know, so you guys, you have this one experience and now are you automatically a believer? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3371.0s)]
*  Do you go through periods where you're like, well, maybe someone was messing with us. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3380.0s)]
*  Maybe it's not real. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3385.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3386.0s)]
*  So that was probably a full year before we went full into haunted. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3387.0s)]
*  So like throughout that, you know, you have phases of your career. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3392.0s)]
*  What? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3396.0s)]
*  Full haunted musicals, all the good stuff. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3397.0s)]
*  First phase. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3402.0s)]
*  We're doing Broadway. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3403.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3404.0s)]
*  And then we did haunted for a while. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3405.0s)]
*  So, yeah, after the rest, we're like, all right, let's dive back into this. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3408.0s)]
*  And it was so interesting. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3411.0s)]
*  And at that point, again, like we're no experts on this. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3413.0s)]
*  Like we're honestly trying to do this to prove to ourselves because of the crazy experience we had a long time ago. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3417.0s)]
*  So we had at least for the first year of us doing like a haunted exclusively on our channel, we had like no equipment. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3422.0s)]
*  Most of the time we'd go in like documentary style and just like interview people, walk around like these hotels or buildings and be like, why is it haunted? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3431.0s)]
*  And then try to test that same theory. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3438.0s)]
*  A lot of times we would get stuff. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3440.0s)]
*  Sometimes we wouldn't. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3441.0s)]
*  But it's all been like a learning process, especially like as we go. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3444.0s)]
*  There are some points that like we'll go a stent with like a couple of months of, I don't know, we haven't had anything actually like blow our minds in a while. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3448.0s)]
*  And then, boom, something else happens. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3457.0s)]
*  It's like brings us right back into it. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3460.0s)]
*  We're also just like coming up with more theories in our head of like what we actually do believe with the paranormal. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3462.0s)]
*  For example, right now, we 100 percent believe in energies and stuff like that. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3467.0s)]
*  And there is no question that you can walk into some places and it's just a different vibe. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3471.0s)]
*  It feels heavier. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3476.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3477.0s)]
*  But do we believe in like the Casper, the ghost sort of like figure ghosts? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3478.0s)]
*  Like not really. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3482.0s)]
*  Maybe we've seen like shadow figures before. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3483.0s)]
*  But have I ever levitated? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3486.0s)]
*  No. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3487.0s)]
*  Have I ever seen something like straight in front of my face where I like undeniable proof that that's a ghost in front of me? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3488.0s)]
*  No. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3493.0s)]
*  It's like been like just out of a corner of the eyes and stuff. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3494.0s)]
*  There's some scientists that believe that things carry memory. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3497.0s)]
*  There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake and he has this theory of morphic resonance. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3500.0s)]
*  And part of his theory is that he thinks objects themselves contain some sort of memory, whether or not you can actually see it. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3505.0s)]
*  Whether or not you can access that memory, but that objects contain memory. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3511.0s)]
*  And he cites that as one of the reasons why people can feel things. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3515.0s)]
*  Like if you're going to a house where someone's been murdered in the house, there's a reason why they have to tell you. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3521.0s)]
*  Like they can't just sell you the house. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3527.0s)]
*  They have to sell it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3529.0s)]
*  Well, by the way, you know, like if someone gets murdered in the house, I think I don't know like for how long after the the and it's probably varies by state to state. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3530.0s)]
*  But I remember in California, like you would have to tell people someone got murdered in the house for sure. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3540.0s)]
*  Like to this day, they can't sell that fucking John Benet house. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3545.0s)]
*  John Benet Ramsey. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3549.0s)]
*  I don't even know what that is. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3550.0s)]
*  She got murdered in Boulder, Colorado. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3552.0s)]
*  She was a beauty pageant queen who was a tiny little girl. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3555.0s)]
*  It was really creepy. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3558.0s)]
*  You ever do those child beauty pageants? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3560.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3562.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, she was murdered when she was very young. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3563.0s)]
*  I don't know how old she was, like eight, nine, something like that. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3566.0s)]
*  And it was a national scandal because they couldn't figure out who murdered her or what happened. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3569.0s)]
*  And some people thought that it was the parents and the Boulder Police Department botched the investigation because they weren't really. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3575.0s)]
*  Boulder is a pretty peaceful place. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3582.0s)]
*  They're not used to murders, especially not murders of children. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3584.0s)]
*  And also, like, there's it exposed people to how weird these child beauty pageants are where you're taking a little girl and you're putting, you know, high heeled shoes on her. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3587.0s)]
*  And short skirts and sexy makeup. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3598.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3601.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3603.0s)]
*  And so it became this thing. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3604.0s)]
*  So we lived in Boulder for a while and we were looking at real estate in Boulder and there was this one house like this is a pretty nice house. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3606.0s)]
*  Like, what? [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3613.0s)]
*  You know, why is this house so cheap? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3614.0s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3615.0s)]
*  It's like it seemed like it should be more expensive. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3616.0s)]
*  And then I googled it. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3618.0s)]
*  And I found out that's the house where John Benet Ramsey had been killed. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3620.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3623.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3624.0s)]
*  I don't know if it ever sold. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3625.0s)]
*  But like the entire time we were there, it was for sale. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3626.0s)]
*  It was for sale before then for years. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3630.0s)]
*  I think they might have even changed the name of the street to try to sell the house. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3633.0s)]
*  Some weird shit. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3639.0s)]
*  I've definitely heard of that happening before. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3641.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, no one's buying this because of that. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3642.0s)]
*  Well, it's a thing like people no one wants to buy a house for a little girl was murdered. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3646.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3651.0s)]
*  It might have been murdered by her parents. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3652.0s)]
*  Like that was the real, the scary part about it was that was the accusations that the mother did it. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3654.0s)]
*  They brought in these handwriting experts and the handwriting experts compared the ransom note with the mother's handwriting. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3660.0s)]
*  And they were trying to say that the mother wrote the ransom note. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3667.0s)]
*  Like, who fucking knows? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3670.0s)]
*  But it's gross enough that no one wanted to have anything to do with the house. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3672.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, it makes sense. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3676.0s)]
*  There's this one time, one of the creepiest places we've ever been is kind of a story like that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3677.0s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the Valeska axe murders? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3682.0s)]
*  No. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3684.0s)]
*  So in Valeska, Iowa, there is this serial killer that came in, apparently, and small little town, a couple thousand people or whatever, little house. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3685.0s)]
*  And somehow this guy was able to come into the house, kill two parents and six kids all in one house with an axe. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3697.0s)]
*  Tiny house. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3707.0s)]
*  Without getting caught at all. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3708.0s)]
*  And to this day, it's an unsolved murder. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3709.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3711.0s)]
*  And it's just so, so bizarre. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3712.0s)]
*  And that was one of the places that like, yeah, oh my God, look at the fucking sign in front of it. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3715.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3721.0s)]
*  Valeska axe murder house and it's dripping blood. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3723.0s)]
*  If you were a neighbor, you'd be like, hey, bro, maybe take that fucking sign down. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3727.0s)]
*  Yeah, a little insensitive for sure. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3731.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3733.0s)]
*  So that was in 1912. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3735.0s)]
*  Yeah, that all happened. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3736.0s)]
*  Over 100 years. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3738.0s)]
*  But that was like one of those things that we'd researched and that was like interesting. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3739.0s)]
*  But as soon as we stepped foot in that house, it was a whole different vibe. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3743.0s)]
*  It was one of those things that like, it was one of the few times we actually had to leave. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3748.0s)]
*  So halfway like after doing a little tour with the tour guide, he was telling us all these stories and just like being in there was weird. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3753.0s)]
*  Like our buddy was like feeling like he's going to throw up and it was just like really odd. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3761.0s)]
*  That doesn't happen every time. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3766.0s)]
*  But when it does, it's kind of like, oh, it might be because of how fucked up it was. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3767.0s)]
*  There was a lot of things that went down in this. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3772.0s)]
*  It's also you know about it, right? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3774.0s)]
*  It would have been interesting if you someone brought you into the house without telling you anything. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3776.0s)]
*  Like, how do you feel in this place? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3781.0s)]
*  And then see how you feel then. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3783.0s)]
*  Right. Is it like a placebo effect? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3785.0s)]
*  Maybe that because you know the story, you're walking in there. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3787.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a crazy placebo, right? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3790.0s)]
*  Like just to know that that a whole family's murder with a fucking act. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3792.0s)]
*  Right. Right. And the most gruesome part about it is the killer used the blunt side of the axe. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3797.0s)]
*  So you can still because we went there to investigate. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3803.0s)]
*  You can still see like the axe markings in the ceiling when he was going back to go down. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3805.0s)]
*  And again, it's so weird because there was like on the top floor, there was like the parents room. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3811.0s)]
*  But then right like five steps down a wooden creaky hallway was the children's room where there was four of them. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3816.0s)]
*  And then there was two more of like the third daughter's friends that they were hanging out with that were downstairs. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3823.0s)]
*  That got murdered as well. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3828.0s)]
*  So how is it possible that he was able to get to all of them with the blunt side and just and like broke like did he break in or was he hiding like in the attic? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3830.0s)]
*  Like we don't know. Really creepy. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3838.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think so. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3840.0s)]
*  That was the one that got you the most. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3842.0s)]
*  Yeah. That like true crime world is like really, really messed up because like again, like the stories you hear too. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3845.0s)]
*  And the allegations of these people is like, oh, God, because for that particular axe murder, the little girls downstairs apparently were the last ones getting killed. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3853.0s)]
*  And because of that, the killer was apparently reported that he like would this is like really disturbing warning. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3862.0s)]
*  Like would like unclothe the little girls. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3871.0s)]
*  And he sat there and he pleasured himself in front of these like dead with like a big like slab of bacon. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3874.0s)]
*  It was like like those types of gruesome with a big slab of bacon. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3881.0s)]
*  He he like sexually pleasured himself to these like bodies. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3885.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like girls under like 10 to I think or 15, something like that. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3889.0s)]
*  And it never happened again. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3893.0s)]
*  And then they never found the guy. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3895.0s)]
*  Do they have suspects? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3896.0s)]
*  So they do have suspects. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3897.0s)]
*  And what's really interesting is the two main subs suspects that a lot of people talk about were not the ones that we ended up talking about in our video. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3899.0s)]
*  Just because right before doing research on this location, we saw this this author that just came out with a book about a serial killer. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3908.0s)]
*  And she thinks she solved the Valeska axe murders because that same exact style of murder was actually this the serial killer that went from Midwest town to Midwest town on a train. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3916.0s)]
*  And it's called The Man from the Train and the same the same exact thing. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3928.0s)]
*  So like things like covering the mirrors after like the death and like the back of an axe, the fact that he was left handed, which he would eat meals like afterwards, like he'd like make himself a meal and sit with all the dead bodies and eat. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3932.0s)]
*  Yeah, cover up every window because he was like ashamed that if he saw his reflection or something like that and every single spot that this traveling serial killer went to would cover the windows and do do weird things like that. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3945.0s)]
*  But they can. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3958.0s)]
*  So how many different times of this guy supposedly do this? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3959.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3962.0s)]
*  I think he was he did a lot like this specific serial killer did like dozens of times. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3963.0s)]
*  But the two main suspects. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3967.0s)]
*  Yeah, with the axes, which is weird. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3969.0s)]
*  And then they explained to us why. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3971.0s)]
*  And this is a little gruesome, too. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3973.0s)]
*  But if you do the sharp side of an axe, it'll get stuck in your skull. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3975.0s)]
*  But if you destroy the skull with the backside, the blunt side, then you can pick up the axe faster. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3979.0s)]
*  And it was like, oh, God, like that's so. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3984.0s)]
*  And we thought we were like, maybe he, you know, drug the family beforehand or like chloroform them or something. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3987.0s)]
*  And there was no sign of like any any drugs like used. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3993.0s)]
*  So according to the book, The Man on the Train, he they describe him for being responsible for up to. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=3996.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4003.0s)]
*  They feel feeling certain that Mueller committed 14 family murders, totaling 59 victims, less certain varying degrees of his involvement and another 25 family murders, totaling an additional 94 victims. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4004.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4016.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4017.0s)]
*  And there's even one in Germany they think might have been attached to have a photo of this guy. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4018.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4022.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4023.0s)]
*  So what was his name? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4024.0s)]
*  Mueller, Paul Mueller. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4025.0s)]
*  And why did they think it was him specifically? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4027.0s)]
*  Did he get arrested? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4030.0s)]
*  I'm just looking at the Wikipedia that breaks down the book. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4031.0s)]
*  He just like the book, the style of the murders were so similar. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4034.0s)]
*  And the two other main suspects that they had hadn't murdered anybody previously. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4038.0s)]
*  And so this guy just coming in train by train to all these different cities. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4043.0s)]
*  Yeah. The other suspects were just like not as intense, I guess you could say, where it was like there was like this one guy named like Jones, I believe, who was just a businessman that maybe had like some rivalry in business with the family. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4047.0s)]
*  But wouldn't result to like murder for that. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4060.0s)]
*  And then there was also just like a creepy referent who was like a Peeping Tom sort of character that was just like the town creep that everybody thought it was. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4063.0s)]
*  Here's the main thing on why I guess they think that what they think. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4070.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can read that. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4074.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4075.0s)]
*  Yeah. According to the Jamis's, a number of murders in the period were assumed by local police to be one off incidents were actually committed by a single person, probably Mueller, based on certain similarities among the crimes. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4077.0s)]
*  The similarities include the same being within a few hundred feet of railroad junction. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4096.0s)]
*  Okay, so that's the with the books titled says the slaughter of entire families in small towns with little or no police force and the families having a barn which the killers believed to have hidden to observe the families. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4104.0s)]
*  Oh, which Felizca had. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4118.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4120.0s)]
*  That's so fucking messed up this guy like waiting in the bar and watching the family go to sleep for how many days, you know, before they were all at church service before it all happened as well, which is horrible. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4121.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4134.0s)]
*  So that one particular you felt something when you're in that place. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4135.0s)]
*  I mean, you just walk in and just feels it's hard to explain. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4140.0s)]
*  But you can feel the negativity in the air where it's almost like as crazy as it sounds like the air feels thicker. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4142.0s)]
*  In a way, my stepfather, who's like a very like, like sober thinking, like rational person went to Gettysburg. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4148.0s)]
*  And he said, You can feel the sadness. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4158.0s)]
*  Yeah, he goes. It just feels horrible. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4162.0s)]
*  Like you're there and you just you feel death because I've never felt anything like that. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4164.0s)]
*  Like you're at a battleground. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4170.0s)]
*  And, you know, even though it's 200 years ago or whatever it was less than 200 years ago, you feel it because you can feel it. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4172.0s)]
*  He goes, I had to get out of there. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4179.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing with some of these places. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4181.0s)]
*  It's not necessarily like, oh, like, you know, immediately just, oh, yeah, this is spiritual energy or whatever like that. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4183.0s)]
*  It's just heavy. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4188.0s)]
*  Or it's just like you feel off when you go into these places. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4189.0s)]
*  Like as soon as you stepped into the the conjuring house, have you ever seen the conjuring movies? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4192.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4196.0s)]
*  So they're actually based on a real house in Rhode Island. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4197.0s)]
*  And that was one of those places that we had walked into. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4200.0s)]
*  And you were like almost getting. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4203.0s)]
*  I almost threw up. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4204.0s)]
*  And I'm not. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4205.0s)]
*  So what's interesting about the paranormal and what we've learned the past four years is that it affects people differently. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4207.0s)]
*  Some people can see stuff. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4213.0s)]
*  Some people claim their mediums and can communicate more. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4214.0s)]
*  I feel like I have more of like an empathic, like almost like I just feel worse like whenever there's something around. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4217.0s)]
*  And so when we first walked in the conjuring house, like there was a point where I thought I was going to throw up and I was looking for exits. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4226.0s)]
*  What's the real story behind the conjuring house? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4233.0s)]
*  What's the actual story? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4235.0s)]
*  So, yeah, the movie story is like this witch best you or whatever. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4237.0s)]
*  But the actual story. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4241.0s)]
*  Here's a bunch of different things that they say are haunted, but it's actually built on the grounds of the house. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4243.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's creepy. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4248.0s)]
*  It's an amazing house. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4251.0s)]
*  State that launched the conjuring universe. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4252.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4257.0s)]
*  What is it like the Marvel Comics universe was I mean the conjuring universe. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4258.0s)]
*  How weird is that? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4261.0s)]
*  That's the problem with people when you start making an industry out of something. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4263.0s)]
*  Turns into a business. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4268.0s)]
*  So what's the original story? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4269.0s)]
*  So the most the most famous we'll get to but like it's built on the same grounds that the King Philip's War was fought on like right at the beginning of the United States and everything. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4270.0s)]
*  So the main people that haunt that are seven dead soldiers that this little girl always kept seeing in the walls and thus it started manifesting more to the entire family. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4281.0s)]
*  So this family called the parent family bought the place in like 1972 and for 10 years they said they would see you know these figures these these soldiers walking around like their beds would shake they would get scratches like and it kept getting worse over the 10 years. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4293.0s)]
*  And the crazy part is it got to become famous because of like the final day that like changed it all. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4311.0s)]
*  They wanted to do like an exorcism on the house because I think who's the mom Perrin. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4320.0s)]
*  Caroline or something. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4325.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4360.0s)]
*  Talk about that. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4361.0s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4362.0s)]
*  So anyway. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4363.0s)]
*  Really. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4364.0s)]
*  Just went a couple weeks ago. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4365.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4366.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4367.0s)]
*  My daughter dragged me to that too. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4369.0s)]
*  So they were doing this like exorcism and that's them. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4370.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4371.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4372.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4373.0s)]
*  That's those folks. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4374.0s)]
*  And so they do an exorcism there. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4375.0s)]
*  And they do an exorcism and I don't know exactly prior to whatever happened why they called [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4376.0s)]
*  it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4382.0s)]
*  She was just having a bad time just like over the last couple of years and they wanted to [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4383.0s)]
*  end. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4385.0s)]
*  And to her claim she was actually thrown like across the entire room and smashed into a [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4386.0s)]
*  wall to where she had an injuries. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4395.0s)]
*  And they were so angry about that that they actually kicked out the demonologist. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4397.0s)]
*  They punched Ed in the face. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4401.0s)]
*  They punched that guy in the face because they thought he was the guy that was like [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4403.0s)]
*  making it worse. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4407.0s)]
*  But I think it just like pissed him off. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4408.0s)]
*  And so that thing. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4409.0s)]
*  When you say they punched him in the face you mean the ghost punch man? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4410.0s)]
*  Oh no no no. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4414.0s)]
*  The parent. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4415.0s)]
*  The dad. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4416.0s)]
*  Oh okay. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4417.0s)]
*  The parent family was like. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4418.0s)]
*  They're getting assaulted? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4419.0s)]
*  The parent family yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4420.0s)]
*  It was like really upset. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4421.0s)]
*  They punched him in the face because he thought that he threw the wife across the room. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4422.0s)]
*  Or he was responsible for it. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4426.0s)]
*  He thought they made it or he was there and like the exorcism that he was conducting [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4428.0s)]
*  made it more angry which in turn hurt his wife. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4432.0s)]
*  Oh so he got angry. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4435.0s)]
*  He was like stop doing this. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4437.0s)]
*  You brought him in. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4438.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4439.0s)]
*  It's like hiring a priest and then punching him in the face. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4440.0s)]
*  Right right. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4442.0s)]
*  Move. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4443.0s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4444.0s)]
*  Move down the street. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4445.0s)]
*  Punching people. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4446.0s)]
*  Come on. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4447.0s)]
*  So the parent family actually wrote a book about that. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4448.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4450.0s)]
*  And they say the Conjuring movies actually don't do it justice of all the things that [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4451.0s)]
*  happened and all the movements and the craziness that happened in that 10 years that they lived [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4455.0s)]
*  there. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4459.0s)]
*  So in the real life actually experiencing it and the trauma that they went through they [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4460.0s)]
*  say it's like 10 times worse. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4464.0s)]
*  And so they feel like it was dead soldiers. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4466.0s)]
*  Like murdered soldiers on the battlefield. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4469.0s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4472.0s)]
*  Well here's where it gets interesting is they don't know what it is but they believe it [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4473.0s)]
*  is something more evil or demonic whatever you believe in that is like controlling all [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4477.0s)]
*  of these like soldiers and stuff and trapping them. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4482.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4485.0s)]
*  The movie goes with that's a person named Basheba who was like a neighbor who everybody [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4486.0s)]
*  just thought was a witch. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4490.0s)]
*  But in real life it was just known as a demonic possession but no trace back of like what [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4492.0s)]
*  it was. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4498.0s)]
*  That's an interesting thing right because that's in a lot of these cases they feel like [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4499.0s)]
*  it's not just ghosts but it's ghosts that are being controlled by some sort of a demonic [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4503.0s)]
*  entity. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4508.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4509.0s)]
*  The demonic entity keeps these ghosts there which is like another layer of belief you [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4510.0s)]
*  have. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4515.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4516.0s)]
*  You just not don't just believe that maybe when people die their energy gets left behind [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4517.0s)]
*  and then maybe that energy gets controlled by demons. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4520.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4523.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4524.0s)]
*  It's like another level. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4525.0s)]
*  We're so into crazy now. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4526.0s)]
*  I don't know if I'm willing to go there. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4527.0s)]
*  It gets meta. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4528.0s)]
*  It gets very meta. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4529.0s)]
*  But if you did encounter a demon nobody would fucking believe you. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4530.0s)]
*  No. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4533.0s)]
*  You would be trapped. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4534.0s)]
*  You would be this person who for the rest of your life goes Bob and his fucking demon [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4535.0s)]
*  stories. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4540.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4541.0s)]
*  Like no one would buy it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4542.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4543.0s)]
*  Like anything you see that are outside of this like logical physical world physical [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4544.0s)]

*  So they go back they go back to the same spot. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4674.400000000001s)]
*  He's gone. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4677.04s)]
*  He disappeared for five days. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4678.400000000001s)]
*  What's like five days. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4681.0s)]
*  I hope I'm not fucking this up. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4682.32s)]
*  So five days later. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4683.400000000001s)]
*  He shows up in town calls calls someone on the cell phone calls the police tells them [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4686.08s)]
*  his story these recordings of him calling the police and telling the story. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4692.8s)]
*  No one knows what happened to him. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4696.56s)]
*  He five days no food no water. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4698.72s)]
*  And his story was that they took him aboard this spaceship and repaired him that he got [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4701.4800000000005s)]
*  damaged by this burst of energy that came off of the spaceship and that they they repaired [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4707.72s)]
*  him and that he communicated with these beings. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4713.52s)]
*  And these beings are what everybody describes as these classic gray aliens these things [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4717.56s)]
*  these big heads and these large eyes and there was different types of creatures that were [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4724.52s)]
*  on this spaceship too. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4730.04s)]
*  But that poor fucking guy for the rest of his life now he's like in his 60s maybe 70s [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4731.12s)]
*  and that's him. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4737.08s)]
*  He came on the podcast. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4737.92s)]
*  Very nice guy. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4738.96s)]
*  But now he's the fucking wacky UFO guy for the rest of his life. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4739.72s)]
*  Like Travis Walton could have been a normal guy and had a normal life and never experienced [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4743.12s)]
*  that. Like would you rather be the person who has the unique experience that nobody [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4749.280000000001s)]
*  believes or never have that experience where you could just live a normal life. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4754.88s)]
*  I wouldn't 100 percent rather have the experience I think because OK maybe not the UFO [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4760.52s)]
*  experience but the reason I think deep down that I'm so intrigued with the paranormal [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4765.84s)]
*  and like these experiences is because in a way it gives me hope of something like further [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4772.24s)]
*  than this. Like I'd rather like instead of like not believing anything and just being [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4778.12s)]
*  like all right I'm just going to die and sit in the ground for the rest of my life or for [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4781.360000000001s)]
*  the rest eternity. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4785.4400000000005s)]
*  I want to even if it's a little notch of faith that there's something else out there I would [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4786.16s)]
*  much rather have that experience. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4791.6s)]
*  But that's my opinion. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4793.360000000001s)]
*  I mean I would agree too. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4794.24s)]
*  I think you know there's going to be people that judge you for what you believe no matter [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4795.72s)]
*  if it is in ghosts or like even talking religion and stuff like that. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4800.0s)]
*  So you might as well just stay true to you know the things you actually experience. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4803.24s)]
*  And I would love to find out its answers. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4806.84s)]
*  It's kind of like giving like you said like a little bit more hope of what comes next. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4809.92s)]
*  Do you guys feel that with your experiences that you've had they're limited in terms of [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4814.12s)]
*  like you haven't had anything like the Conjuring House happen to you but you've had enough [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4820.24s)]
*  happen where you've been around enough that you have questions. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4824.84s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's the thing is that's where we like draw the line with like what we believe [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4829.639999999999s)]
*  in what we don't like. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4834.72s)]
*  I don't think if I keep doing this I'm going to start levitating. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4835.68s)]
*  If I do that would be the straw. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4838.84s)]
*  That would be the final thing. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4840.96s)]
*  If I levitate. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4842.32s)]
*  I saw the Sally House video today. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4843.4s)]
*  Yeah I watched the Sally House video today where I was working out and those people were [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4845.599999999999s)]
*  telling me that telling you rather that they levitated. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4849.2s)]
*  Yes the medium. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4851.72s)]
*  But they're so like dead serious and there seems so normal. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4853.76s)]
*  They seem so normal other than the fact they said they levitate. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4856.72s)]
*  But dude if I levitate tomorrow then that's that's it. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4860.08s)]
*  I don't have to do it again because I would believe oh yeah this is awesome. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4863.2s)]
*  I don't think it's going to happen to me. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4867.16s)]
*  No but there are things there are so many things that we've seen that are like OK that [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4868.72s)]
*  makes me want to inch a little closer or try it again or do it again. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4874.4s)]
*  You know there's that like you know spark of like oh I cannot explain how that happens. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4877.56s)]
*  What's the most profound one that you guys have experienced. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4882.400000000001s)]
*  I mean there's size Queen Mary. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4886.320000000001s)]
*  There's both like an individual experiences that have been insane. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4887.52s)]
*  For me for example I went in Texas actually there was a spot called Bowers Mansion. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4892.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know what city it was in. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4897.4800000000005s)]
*  It was a small small town in Texas. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4899.0s)]
*  And this was one of these spots where nobody has ever investigated or with just like a [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4901.4800000000005s)]
*  handful of people. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4906.64s)]
*  So we were going to be like the first YouTube was to really investigate and put it on the [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4907.4400000000005s)]
*  map. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4911.160000000001s)]
*  And it had to deal with like I think it was like a murder suicide. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4912.6s)]
*  Some guy like killed his wife and then shot himself. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4916.200000000001s)]
*  And we're trying to like especially this year and in the future try to just put ourselves [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4919.320000000001s)]
*  in more scary situations so it never you know it's always like exciting and stuff like [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4924.76s)]
*  that. So we were trying to do like more like a lone challenges and stuff and just things [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4929.64s)]
*  that like give us more fear. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4933.280000000001s)]
*  And so for this specific one I had the challenge of like staying in the entire mansion by [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4935.28s)]
*  myself and I was on the top floor in like a room which was deemed to be like the most [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4939.96s)]
*  haunted. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4946.4400000000005s)]
*  Apparently a guy named like Bernard had lived there like in the past and basically was like [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4947.64s)]
*  stuck in a wheelchair his entire life and stayed in that room and would like only look out [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4953.4800000000005s)]
*  the window and that's it. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4958.68s)]
*  And he died and apparently still in the room. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4959.64s)]
*  And so I'm up there and Sam is not even in the house. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4962.36s)]
*  I think you're actually in the cellar. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4965.2s)]
*  And then one of our other buddies is like across the street. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4966.72s)]
*  And earlier before we all did like the alone investigation the door as we were walking [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4969.36s)]
*  down the stairs of the Bernard room closed shut and we were all like wait did you guys hear [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4975.08s)]
*  that too. Was that just my imagination. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4979.72s)]
*  We run up there. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4981.8s)]
*  It's completely shut. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4982.92s)]
*  And so we obviously propped it back open. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4984.16s)]
*  But since I knew that had happened before I was just up there like asking questions to [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4985.76s)]
*  Bernard. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4990.2s)]
*  And I was just like all right Bernard if you're really up here why don't you slam this door [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4990.64s)]
*  right behind me like you did for us earlier. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4994.56s)]
*  It's just me and you do it. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4996.56s)]
*  And sure enough like the door slammed right behind me. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=4999.08s)]
*  It's like right when I turn. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5003.160000000001s)]
*  So you're alone in this mansion. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5004.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5006.320000000001s)]
*  And you're talking to ghosts. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5006.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5007.88s)]
*  And you're asking the ghost to slam the door and he slams the door and he slams right behind [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5008.280000000001s)]
*  me. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5012.240000000001s)]
*  And you're sitting there going what. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5012.320000000001s)]
*  Not sitting there. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5015.08s)]
*  Not sitting there. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5017.120000000001s)]
*  I went into tears like it's all on camera like I've never like gotten like super emotional [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5018.4s)]
*  like from going to these like haunted places. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5024.0s)]
*  But it brought me to tears where I just immediately started walking. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5026.0s)]
*  And of course like this is our job. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5030.0s)]
*  We want this stuff to happen. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5031.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5033.36s)]
*  But I've never had it was almost more of like a jump scare that was startling than anything. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5033.76s)]
*  It was right behind me. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5038.48s)]
*  What technology exists like what do ghost hunters use like what's the cream of the crop. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5039.52s)]
*  What's like the Tesla of of ghost hunting technology. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5045.36s)]
*  Like what's the iPhone of ghost probably the EMS is like the most standard one. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5050.24s)]
*  EMF. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5055.0s)]
*  And what does that stand for. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5055.56s)]
*  It's like magnetic frequencies. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5058.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5059.88s)]
*  Field or something. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5060.12s)]
*  Emf detector basically just detects changes in EMF energy. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5060.88s)]
*  So like you know if nothing's changing at all it won't do anything. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5065.12s)]
*  But if there's something like movement or like you know new energy enters the room or [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5069.12s)]
*  something like that it'll spike. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5073.96s)]
*  And so that's like what a lot of the equipment is based off of. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5075.0s)]
*  What's really interesting the stuff that we do now as we try to integrate just more [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5078.56s)]
*  normal like everyday objects into our investigation because of the fact that a lot of [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5084.36s)]
*  people are skeptical. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5089.16s)]
*  So for example one of the pieces of equipment that we use a lot is like a cat toy that [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5090.12s)]
*  lights up when you touch it. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5096.24s)]
*  So we put cat balls around and you know we've seen them sit there for hours and nothing [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5098.0s)]
*  happens. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5103.2s)]
*  And then like one time we'll be like all right if there's someone in the room can you go [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5103.639999999999s)]
*  touch that cat ball 20 feet away from us. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5107.24s)]
*  Well I saw the episode that you guys filmed at that sanitarium. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5109.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know you probably film many of them in a sanitarium but you had a cat toy and [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5114.12s)]
*  you also had this little box with an antenna that comes out of it like a circle. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5118.639999999999s)]
*  It's like a flat disk with an antenna and it was going off. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5123.4s)]
*  You did it. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5126.639999999999s)]
*  You set it in a room and you walked away and you let the camera run. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5127.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5131.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh Waverly Hills. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5132.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5133.84s)]
*  That is a crazy scene. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5134.16s)]
*  Yes that's nuts. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5135.64s)]
*  That's so what is so this device. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5136.68s)]
*  Explain what this device is this device with the antenna. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5140.16s)]
*  So it looks like a giant hockey puck. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5143.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5144.64s)]
*  So the RIM pod is what they call it. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5144.88s)]
*  I don't know what that stands for really but it does the same thing. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5146.76s)]
*  So that antenna emits an electromagnetic field that's probably like two feet wide. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5148.92s)]
*  And so if there's something that's right there right there. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5155.04s)]
*  So something enters that electromagnetic field it'll change the frequency and that [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5157.96s)]
*  would mean that would actually go when it lights up like that that means something is [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5163.0s)]
*  literally right next to it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5166.5599999999995s)]
*  So what was crazy is I think Kobe sat there for I don't know you put it down and it was [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5168.599999999999s)]
*  two or three minutes until it actually went to give context a little bit. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5174.16s)]
*  It was the challenge was to go put the RIM pod downstairs by like this ball or whatever [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5178.5599999999995s)]
*  and everybody else was upstairs and we had to go alone and do it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5183.24s)]
*  And so I went down here and I put this RIM pod down set up the camera and then we're all [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5186.04s)]
*  upstairs. We have no idea this is going on at all. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5189.320000000001s)]
*  We should explain why why the ball because there was a video of a ball sitting there by [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5193.0s)]
*  itself and you're watching this ball and it's not moving forever and then all of a sudden [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5199.400000000001s)]
*  just rolled by itself. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5205.8s)]
*  So that was really crazy. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5208.04s)]
*  We what was that ball like where was that ball and who set the camera up for that. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5209.64s)]
*  So that wasn't our video but the people that we went with who are our friends that was [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5214.24s)]
*  their video. They had been to that place like three or four times and one of the times they [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5218.68s)]
*  had set that ball down because the story goes that the person the spirit or whatever that [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5222.24s)]
*  is moving that ball is like a little kid. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5227.96s)]
*  And you know it's a sanatorium it was like really sad but you know the kids were allowed [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5230.5199999999995s)]
*  to like play on that level. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5234.4s)]
*  And so if you put a ball down it's supposedly if there's someone there it will move and [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5236.5599999999995s)]
*  they put that little rope there specifically so that no wind would get it like you'd have [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5242.32s)]
*  to actually put like an immense force to push it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5246.36s)]
*  And so our buddies who had been there before filmed I think they said it was like a three [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5249.44s)]
*  hour clip three hours of this ball sitting in that same area. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5253.24s)]
*  That's why we put the ball there of just nothingness. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5257.639999999999s)]
*  And then like you said it didn't seem like it was wind or like slow. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5260.48s)]
*  It was like immediate push. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5263.92s)]
*  Yeah boom. And it like went off. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5265.799999999999s)]
*  So it looks like on the video. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5267.12s)]
*  It's the video is bizarre. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5268.5199999999995s)]
*  It was a video because I don't know technical challenges or whatever. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5271.2s)]
*  He was filming his YouTube video. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5274.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know why he was filming the video. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5276.639999999999s)]
*  That's why it looks so bad. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5278.16s)]
*  But yeah basically he witnessed this ball after three hours randomly just getting how [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5279.8s)]
*  does it get that kinetic energy to boom move. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5286.0s)]
*  It's not a wind. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5288.4s)]
*  So you guys decide to set this up. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5289.719999999999s)]
*  So you put the ball down there and this. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5291.28s)]
*  What is this box called again. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5292.92s)]
*  The Rem Pod. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5294.36s)]
*  Rem Pod. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5295.0s)]
*  And so does that detect wind. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5296.12s)]
*  No it's. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5299.320000000001s)]
*  So does wind set it off. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5301.04s)]
*  Like if you set it up outside and it's windy. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5302.52s)]
*  That won't set it off. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5304.68s)]
*  No it's only like coming in contact with it pretty much. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5305.52s)]
*  Yeah. So something has to touch it. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5309.0s)]
*  Either touch it or in the field. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5310.64s)]
*  So if you put your hand within a foot it'll change. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5312.200000000001s)]
*  But if you're not like he was standing next to it for like a minute talking what he's [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5314.84s)]
*  doing and it wasn't going off and then he leaves the room completely. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5319.04s)]
*  He's probably 600 feet away. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5322.320000000001s)]
*  We went up two floors and down the hall and then it started going off which was so [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5323.92s)]
*  monumental to us because it's like why for the entire time that you were there. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5327.84s)]
*  Nothing's happening. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5332.68s)]
*  But as soon as you leave you are as soon as I leave. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5333.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5336.4400000000005s)]
*  Like yeah. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5336.8s)]
*  Is there any conventional explanation that anybody's ever given you why that thing [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5337.84s)]
*  would just go off like that. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5342.12s)]
*  Well that's again we're no expert in all this stuff. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5343.64s)]
*  There probably might be for half the time. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5346.92s)]
*  Like there's definitely quite coincidences that happen in our videos and there's a lot [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5349.320000000001s)]
*  of things that we debunk and write up to be coincidences. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5353.56s)]
*  It's the coincidences that happen so like linear to our questions are perfect questions [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5356.76s)]
*  that make us believe more. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5363.64s)]
*  So it's not like we believe everything that happens and we're like maybe equipment will [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5364.96s)]
*  get triggered by other things just like anything has a battery operated. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5368.56s)]
*  So you know some skeptics out there could say like maybe the battery is almost dead [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5371.92s)]
*  and right. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5375.68s)]
*  Maybe malfunctioning. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5376.360000000001s)]
*  Who knows. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5377.52s)]
*  Do you think that maybe the more you do this stuff the more things happen to you. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5378.320000000001s)]
*  I think that's what has happened. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5384.4s)]
*  I think so. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5385.88s)]
*  And we're just learning that too. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5386.639999999999s)]
*  That's what's weird about it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5388.0s)]
*  Like I'm trying to look at this as a skeptic and I'm also trying to look at this as a [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5389.48s)]
*  believer. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5393.84s)]
*  I'm trying to be agnostic. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5394.04s)]
*  I'm trying to be open minded. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5395.08s)]
*  I'm trying to watch these things and I'm like what if you guys are opening up some [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5396.32s)]
*  fucking doorway to interactions with something or some kind of energy or some kind of life [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5400.5599999999995s)]
*  forms that exist in some weird dimension. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5408.16s)]
*  And the more you interact with them the more they're accessible to you. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5411.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5416.04s)]
*  That's what it seems. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5416.88s)]
*  If you're not full of shit you don't seem full of shit. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5417.76s)]
*  You seem like very nice gentleman. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5419.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5421.04s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5421.4800000000005s)]
*  If you're not full of shit then like something's happening. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5423.0s)]
*  So what is that. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5425.92s)]
*  Why do you guys keep having these experiences. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5426.52s)]
*  Well first of all you're going to these places that are known. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5428.96s)]
*  Either people have been murdered there or fucking I mean imagine the craziness of a [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5432.320000000001s)]
*  sanitarium. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5436.12s)]
*  You're in a mental health institution where people are going to these places and you [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5437.320000000001s)]
*  have an institution where people died. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5441.2s)]
*  Thousands. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5442.72s)]
*  Who knows. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5443.4s)]
*  And so this fucking creepy energy exists in that building already. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5444.5599999999995s)]
*  And how that Waverly House. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5448.76s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5450.8s)]
*  Waverly Hills. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5451.32s)]
*  Waverly Hills. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5451.96s)]
*  How long had that been abandoned when you guys got there. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5452.72s)]
*  I think I closed down in the 60s or 70s. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5456.4s)]
*  I'm not a hundred percent sure but definitely like decades. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5459.24s)]
*  And is it hard for you to get access to these places. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5463.04s)]
*  They just let you go. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5466.08s)]
*  Yeah so to that point we've actually like upped the bar a lot since we started. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5467.24s)]
*  Like when we started at just like places in Kansas. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5472.44s)]
*  Yeah like not as much not as many things that happen but we think part of the reason [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5475.639999999999s)]
*  why more things are happening is because we have access to bigger and better things. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5479.599999999999s)]
*  That Waverly Hills place we wanted to go for six years. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5483.8s)]
*  We couldn't get access to it. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5487.48s)]
*  It sells out in 20 minutes for the entire year to just gain gain access to it. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5488.599999999999s)]
*  Really. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5493.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5493.96s)]
*  What do people do have raves in there. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5494.5599999999995s)]
*  I guess. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5496.0s)]
*  Some people party some people like having little kids like birthdays. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5496.64s)]
*  So people rent that fucking creepy place out. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5500.4800000000005s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5503.0s)]
*  But they rent that all. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5505.080000000001s)]
*  Jamie we need to have the fucking JRE party. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5506.4800000000005s)]
*  There we go. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5511.0s)]
*  Have a festival. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5511.56s)]
*  In Louisville so like a Derby weekend or something. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5512.56s)]
*  Derby weekend have a festival at a mental health institution. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5515.240000000001s)]
*  So people rent it out and do stuff there. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5519.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah all the time. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5523.200000000001s)]
*  Mostly it's like it's known for its haunted nature. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5523.96s)]
*  So like almost everyone who's renting out is going there because they want to explore it. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5527.12s)]
*  They want to see the history or they want to ghost hunt. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5530.84s)]
*  But yeah it's been a blessing because as we've gotten bigger with this more and more [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5533.56s)]
*  locations have been open to having us there. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5537.68s)]
*  And a lot of people will reach out and be like hey this is like this crazier story that we [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5540.4s)]
*  had you know never had access to before. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5543.56s)]
*  And now we get to have those. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5545.8s)]
*  Yeah I'm curious. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5546.72s)]
*  Have you ever heard of something called an Eager Gore and Eager Gore. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5547.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5550.36s)]
*  Before. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5550.64s)]
*  So we had just learned about this too like recently. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5551.32s)]
*  But basically the theory is that if there's enough people believing in something by just [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5554.48s)]
*  manifesting it in their minds it becomes real. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5560.84s)]
*  And so for example like with this spot it's like there's been so many people that have [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5564.44s)]
*  heard the dark history of Waverly Hills that maybe they're believing it into existence. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5569.08s)]
*  Like there's so many people going there to ghost hunt. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5576.16s)]
*  So many people hearing about the trauma of it every single day that all that energy that's [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5578.4s)]
*  just a theory is like trapped there as well. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5583.28s)]
*  Yeah who knows. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5585.64s)]
*  That's what's weird about thoughts like who knows what what it can cause. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5586.8s)]
*  Do you believe in manifestation at all. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5592.16s)]
*  Like do you believe in where like if you think positively or think about something you want [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5593.8s)]
*  to happen in your life like it eventually turns out. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5598.8s)]
*  The problem with those thoughts are the people that tell you that have had positive [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5600.96s)]
*  experiences. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5606.36s)]
*  So like if someone is a rock star and they said I dreamed it into existence like OK great [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5607.679999999999s)]
*  but you also had talent you worked hard. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5612.599999999999s)]
*  That's true. Like how many people like tried to dream it into existence but it didn't [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5614.16s)]
*  happen. Right. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5618.0s)]
*  I think it's a combination of stuff. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5619.48s)]
*  I think that visualization and it's possible that there's something more to thoughts than [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5623.04s)]
*  just here's a thing that I have in my head and I I put it out there and you know it's [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5630.0s)]
*  just a thought. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5636.08s)]
*  Maybe there's some sort of creative energy that's attached to thoughts that maybe we're [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5637.12s)]
*  not aware of. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5642.8s)]
*  But I think the problem with like things like the secret and the law of attraction is that [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5643.88s)]
*  it's those very esoteric and fascinating concepts are there. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5650.28s)]
*  They're hijacked by hucksters and then assholes come along and tell you Sam I've got the [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5657.04s)]
*  secret to you living a happy successful life. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5663.56s)]
*  And they sell you a product. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5666.6s)]
*  You can have everything you need by following my 12 step course. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5667.64s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5671.68s)]
*  And then you know someone pretends that they have this sort of attachment to this to the [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5672.56s)]
*  point where they've they've documented it and they know exactly how it works and they [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5678.360000000001s)]
*  know no it's a feeling there's a thing to it. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5683.400000000001s)]
*  It might be real. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5687.0s)]
*  There might be something to it but there's a lot of other stuff that has to be in place [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5688.320000000001s)]
*  too. Like if you want the perfect life you want like to manifest this incredible existence. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5692.92s)]
*  It also requires an immense amount of work. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5699.56s)]
*  It's not like you just fucking think it and dream it into being maybe even a bit of luck. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5701.88s)]
*  A lot of luck. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5706.56s)]
*  But what is luck. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5708.08s)]
*  Maybe you're manifesting. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5709.28s)]
*  It's luck already destiny. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5710.6s)]
*  Luck is working hard to put yourself in good situations. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5711.8s)]
*  Yes. But also luck because you can get hit by a fucking meteor. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5715.04s)]
*  That is true. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5718.64s)]
*  You know and has nothing to do. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5719.16s)]
*  You could be a child and get killed in a drive by. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5720.4s)]
*  Like luck is real. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  There's bad luck. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5724.599999999999s)]
*  There's good luck. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5725.44s)]
*  Shit shit happens. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5726.16s)]
*  That's real too. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5727.28s)]
*  So it's hard to say because it's all it's all discussed by the winners. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5728.719999999999s)]
*  You know like I had a photo of a house that I put on my wall and that was my vision board and I made that a reality and I built this business from the ground up with my own thoughts. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5734.2s)]
*  Did you really. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5745.96s)]
*  Did you work too. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5746.96s)]
*  Did you. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5748.08s)]
*  You know like it's good to have this belief because that also gets you up in the morning and it fuels your discipline. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5748.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5754.68s)]
*  Because you have this firm belief that you're going to make it happen. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5754.88s)]
*  And then when you do make it happen you're like I dreamed it into existence. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5757.56s)]
*  But that wasn't the only piece of the puzzle. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5761.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5763.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5763.5199999999995s)]
*  But I think it is an important part of the piece of puzzle to see what you're focusing on just like you know. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5764.08s)]
*  Be magic. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5768.84s)]
*  There might be something to it. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5770.08s)]
*  There might be. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5771.4s)]
*  There might be something to it but it might be just an ingredient that along with discipline and along with a plan. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5771.84s)]
*  And along with talent. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5778.16s)]
*  But there might be something to dreaming things into existence. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5779.88s)]
*  So so whatever you focus on will be what you work on. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5782.84s)]
*  You know like if you're whatever you focus on you know like as an accountant if you're always looking for errors you're going to see all the wrong doings in your life because you're looking for errors. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5785.6s)]
*  But if you're optimistic and you're always looking for positives you're going to find more positives. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5793.16s)]
*  Well this speaks to what we were talking about earlier about being young and failing a lot like you concentrate on those failures. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5797.2s)]
*  Then you think of yourself as a failure. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5803.6s)]
*  It's very dangerous for people because I've seen it with people where they have a few bad experiences like in high school like they fall apart a few times and you know they lose jobs they lose this they lose that and then they're a loser. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5805.36s)]
*  And then in their mind they're a loser because they're concentrating only on those negative experiences they've had instead of like getting past that and growing and say that was a valuable life experience and that's caused me to. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5818.36s)]
*  Re-evaluate and reassess the way I communicate and change the way I think and caused me to get up earlier and work harder and that made me a winner because bad experiences are very valuable like failing is very valuable because it sucks. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5830.639999999999s)]
*  And when you're in jail you're probably like bro this can't keep happening. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5846.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5851.96s)]
*  That's the good aspect of bad experiences is that it gives you like an incredibly powerful motivating tool. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5854.76s)]
*  You know so I don't know whether or not you can manifest things into existence but I'm not opposed to the idea totally. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5862.52s)]
*  I am opposed to the idea that it's the only thing I'm opposed to the idea like the secret you know like I'm going to you know that documentary the secret. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5869.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5878.0s)]
*  There was like a bunch of people that really believed that they were just going to think things into existence. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5878.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah that's the saddest thing. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5883.36s)]
*  There was this girl who was friends with a friend of mine and she was at the comedy store one night and she's like I am you know I'm so happy because I found the secret and I'm going to meet the man of my dreams and I'm going to have the career that I've always wanted. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5885.12s)]
*  I'm like how are you going to do that. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5900.5599999999995s)]
*  She's like well I just started following the secret and like Oprah was you know talking about her on her show and all these people believe this here. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5902.5199999999995s)]
*  Hey Oprah you already fucking you have the secret. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5909.8s)]
*  All right. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5912.28s)]
*  You're already Oprah Oprah. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5912.56s)]
*  You can't just fucking start selling dreams. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5914.76s)]
*  So so I didn't see this lady for like a couple of years and then I ran into her at another comedy show. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5917.4s)]
*  I'm like hey how you doing. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5926.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm seeing you forever. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5927.92s)]
*  She's like yeah things aren't working out like I really thought that I was going to be able to control my life with the secret. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5929.52s)]
*  But you know my father is still a fucking loser and you know every guy dates an idiot and and you know I don't have the career that I wanted. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5939.52s)]
*  I was like oh yeah. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5948.12s)]
*  It's not that simple. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5950.8s)]
*  So sad too because that's what I always like think about when someone asks like oh my god like I want to be YouTube. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5952.0s)]
*  Everyone wants to be a YouTuber now or wants to be on social media or tick tock and everyone's like oh yeah it's just you know easy post a video or something like that. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5957.6s)]
*  But you don't realize how much work goes into it or how much you have to try and be able to accept failure for months on months on months before you see all the [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5964.12s)]
*  It takes a certain type of person to put themselves out there which is a whole nother topic but it's so sad that like this new generation is kind of like being born into where everybody has followers now. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5974.120000000001s)]
*  Like when Sam and I were in high school and we started popping off on Vine like it was like frowned upon like we were not popular in high school whatsoever. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5984.56s)]
*  But now it seems like yeah kids just are born into that where they have iPads at a super young age. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5992.96s)]
*  Tick tock is weird because they just make you have large following so that you'll be addicted to it. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=5998.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6005.4s)]
*  I've heard kids talk about I have 2000 followers like they're fucking you. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6006.16s)]
*  They're lying to you. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6010.2s)]
*  And think about making you get more followers so that you get addicted. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6011.759999999999s)]
*  Smart. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6015.28s)]
*  And think about like after you do get those followers. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6016.04s)]
*  Let's say you do have one viral video and then you never get it again. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6018.5199999999995s)]
*  So you have like you had this one success and you're addicted to it and you fail and fail and fail and fail. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6021.92s)]
*  How hard is that on the psyche to just be like oh I did it and now I can never do it again. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6026.24s)]
*  That's why I like this viral concept nowadays with tick tock because I feel like even worse. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6032.0s)]
*  It's definitely weird. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6037.0s)]
*  Like how about that dude with cranberry juice that skateboarding. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6038.04s)]
*  That guy is like his life changed for like a month and then now he's like oh now it's back to normal. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6041.68s)]
*  Like he hit magic in a bottle with that one video. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6047.28s)]
*  It's like winning the lottery and then realizing your real life later on. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6050.84s)]
*  It's like winning the lottery for 100 grand. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6054.4800000000005s)]
*  It's great to have 100 grand but then like you know can't retire off of that. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6057.16s)]
*  Yeah I mean you got to do something else like something has to happen. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6061.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6064.56s)]
*  That guy was like on a television show right. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6065.4800000000005s)]
*  What was the show. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6068.08s)]
*  I just I'm looking at an article right now from a couple of months ago. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6068.56s)]
*  Yeah but the thing is like how long ago was that was that a year and a half ago or so. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6071.88s)]
*  It was during the pandemic. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6077.16s)]
*  So 2020. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6078.36s)]
*  OK. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6080.64s)]
*  So two years ago. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6081.0s)]
*  So two plus years ago this dude does that three years ago now I guess. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6082.4400000000005s)]
*  So. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6086.72s)]
*  Yeah man it just goes away. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6088.28s)]
*  Yeah I mean there's been so many occurrences of that like throughout all time of social media. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6089.88s)]
*  For dog faces for 20 dog face. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6095.32s)]
*  No in from that. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6098.92s)]
*  He's got tons of followers. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6100.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh 7.4 million followers and one hundred and twenty two point six million likes. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6101.12s)]

*  So he has parlayed it. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6110.12s)]
*  But look at this new video is 11000 views like that's bullshit. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6111.5599999999995s)]
*  Bro we got to do better. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6115.04s)]

*  Well that's the thing. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6134.639999999999s)]
*  Well obviously that guy got a taste. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6135.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6138.2s)]
*  You got to be. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6138.5599999999995s)]
*  How many people watch that Fleetwood Mac video. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6138.96s)]
*  All of them. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6141.28s)]
*  Everyone. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6142.5599999999995s)]
*  The whole world. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6143.48s)]
*  Was it a Super Bowl commercial. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6144.12s)]
*  Oh really. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6145.719999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6146.88s)]
*  But that's also like one hit wonders with music right. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6147.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6150.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6151.12s)]
*  Imagine you're at the top of the charts with one song and then it fucking never happens again. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6151.639999999999s)]
*  Never again. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6156.8s)]
*  How's that. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6157.32s)]
*  Ton of those out there. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6157.719999999999s)]
*  Tons. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6159.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6159.92s)]
*  Like you're a rock star for one song. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6160.28s)]
*  And like they get conceited about it too. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6162.76s)]
*  Like they're all like sitting on a high horse for like a year. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6164.719999999999s)]
*  Then you're just like just the same with social media kids. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6167.4s)]
*  We met so many kids without saying names of course where they're like on this tick tock wave of like oh yeah I'm awesome now or like whatever. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6169.5599999999995s)]
*  Like I'm in the social media world. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6177.24s)]
*  And then like a year later and they're just nothing. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6178.719999999999s)]
*  That's the trap. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6180.959999999999s)]
*  This morning I saw this article of a girl who did I think it was musical or something. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6181.799999999999s)]
*  She had three plus million followers on Instagram and tried to come up with a merch line and only sold like 10 or 15 t-shirts. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6186.839999999999s)]
*  And it was like so yeah you got all these people to follow you. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6194.919999999999s)]
*  But like they're not fans of you. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6198.28s)]
*  Are you. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6200.12s)]
*  What are you doing with this following. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6200.68s)]
*  And it's just so weird because a lot of people think that as soon as like they have this one blow up video their life has changed forever. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6202.12s)]
*  But it's a lot of work to continue on. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6207.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6210.2s)]
*  But at least you got some spark. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6211.12s)]
*  The question is like what do you do with that spark. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6214.04s)]
*  How do you turn those embers into a roaring fire. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6217.84s)]
*  And some people figure it out and some people don't. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6221.360000000001s)]
*  But that's the beauty of what's happening now is that folks like you who don't have any experience in Hollywood you don't even have backgrounds and doing musicals and plays like all of a sudden you're in show business. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6223.48s)]
*  You guys are in show but it's like self created show business. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6239.12s)]
*  But it's massively successful. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6242.919999999999s)]
*  You guys have like I've seen videos you have like what's the most views one of your videos has. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6245.16s)]
*  Isn't it the contrary or Stanley. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6250.12s)]
*  Like 30 million. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6251.639999999999s)]
*  That is fucking bonkers crazy. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6252.599999999999s)]
*  Stop and think about that. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6254.839999999999s)]
*  Like of a movie has 30 million people going to see it. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6256.08s)]
*  Holy shit is that huge. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6259.44s)]
*  That's gigantic. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6261.599999999999s)]
*  They can't even imagine that in a television show. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6263.32s)]
*  But television show has 30 million views. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6265.5599999999995s)]
*  That's gigantic. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6268.24s)]
*  Well it's just you guys just by yourself. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6269.719999999999s)]
*  And we do all the editing ourselves as well. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6271.719999999999s)]
*  I shoot everything ourselves. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6273.48s)]
*  So it's literally just us with the camera. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6274.799999999999s)]
*  That's why we're not we always claim like we're not trying to force any information down anybody's throats. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6276.32s)]
*  We're not like a TV show. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6280.679999999999s)]
*  We're like two kids from Kansas with a camera trying to. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6281.92s)]
*  But it's also why it resonates. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6285.6s)]
*  That's why people are into it because it's seen. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6288.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like there's other people involved. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6290.08s)]
*  It seems like it's all you guys. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6293.0s)]
*  Like it feels like it's you guys. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6295.16s)]
*  So people who become fans of your show they actually become fans of you. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6297.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6301.360000000001s)]
*  Because they like they like hanging out with you guys. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6301.68s)]
*  They like hanging out with you guys while you freak out in a sanitarium. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6303.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6306.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6306.64s)]
*  Literally. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6306.92s)]

*  And if something happens it might be a life changing experience. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6331.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6334.6s)]

*  I watched one last night with my daughter where you guys went to Romania. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6341.32s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6344.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6345.88s)]
*  So this is Vlad Tepes. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6347.04s)]
*  That's is that really where he supposedly lived or is one of his castles. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6349.36s)]
*  Is that what it was. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6354.04s)]
*  Yeah one of I think his main castle was different but he fought like some battle there and we also went to his death place. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6355.48s)]
*  But yeah like how many people had died on that ground probably thousands and thousands. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6363.56s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6369.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6369.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6370.360000000001s)]
*  The the bottle of Dracula piss that you carry around with you when when you're in that guy's area like this guy for people don't know Dracula the book by Bram Stoker and all the movies were based on this man named Vlad the Impaler who used to eat lunch while he had his enemies like [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6370.76s)]
*  writhing on spikes in front of him. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6393.24s)]
*  He was notoriously a ruse which which by the way someone sent me that Matt Stagg sent me this that he had been captured when he was younger. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6396.2s)]
*  He had been imprisoned when he was younger and probably had been raped and tortured. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6407.599999999999s)]
*  And that's why the yeah that's one of the reasons why he was such a ruthless person like he when he was a very young man I believe. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6413.599999999999s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6421.599999999999s)]

*  Oh my god. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6424.0s)]
*  There's so many people like that from history where you you hear about what they did and you just ameliorate. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6425.16s)]
*  This is the general. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6432.08s)]
*  You can reread that I guess. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6434.08s)]
*  It says when Vlad was called to a diplomatic meeting in 1442 with Sultan Murad the second he brought his young sons Vlad the third and Rod due along but the meeting was actually a trap. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6435.599999999999s)]
*  All three were arrested and held hostage. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6447.92s)]
*  The elder Vlad was released under the condition that he leave his sons behind. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6450.6s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6455.96s)]
*  Years of captivity under the Ottomans Vlad and his younger brothers were tortured. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6457.56s)]
*  Oh tutored rather in science philosophy and the arts Vlad also became a skilled horseman a warrior according to some accounts. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6462.64s)]
*  However he may have been imprisoned and tortured for part of that time during which he would have witnessed the impalement of his the Ottomans enemies. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6468.48s)]
*  Scary. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6479.759999999999s)]
*  There's even rumors that like he would drink the blood of his enemies which is why he gets compared to Dracula so much. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6480.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6486.599999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6487.2s)]

*  The rest of Vlad's family however failed even worse. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6491.759999999999s)]
*  His father was ousted as the ruler of how do you say that word. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6494.839999999999s)]

*  Vlad's older brother Mercia was tortured blinded and buried alive. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6507.719999999999s)]
*  People were fucking rude. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6515.959999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6518.16s)]
*  Dracula means son of the dragon. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6519.5599999999995s)]
*  Well in Romania they say means devil now they call Dracula. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6521.16s)]
*  They use that term like they they. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6525.64s)]
*  But it used to interchangeable with devil. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6528.360000000001s)]
*  That's what it used to mean. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6530.200000000001s)]
*  Son of dragon was what it originally was but nowadays they say it's devil. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6531.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6535.240000000001s)]

*  because in Odessa there is this giant like labyrinth of catacombs underneath the [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6625.879999999999s)]
*  city is basically like a mine. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6632.92s)]

*  This is a circle. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6699.68s)]
*  You guys got to find your way back over to me but I'm going to leave you alone. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6700.8s)]
*  And so this is like a labyrinth. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6703.96s)]
*  This is a giant labyrinth. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6706.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever seen like how this guy has this shit all memorized. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6707.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6710.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6711.320000000001s)]
*  So we're going and things that look like that the entire time. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6711.88s)]
*  And he asks us to go in like a base of a figure eight. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6714.68s)]
*  That's that guy. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6719.400000000001s)]
*  And he's like find me. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6721.12s)]
*  And if I and if you don't find me like if I wanted to I could leave. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6723.12s)]
*  He was a nice guy. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6725.92s)]
*  He wouldn't do it. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6726.6s)]
*  But at that point letting you know we we we realized at that point oh god like we [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6727.2s)]
*  could die right now. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6732.52s)]
*  It is absolutely terrifying that all those markings on a wall was apparently a [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6735.360000000001s)]
*  story of a guy that got trapped in there and kept seeing that like figure that [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6739.4400000000005s)]
*  little shadow figure on the wall. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6743.64s)]
*  And so he went crazy and wrote a ton of different things. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6746.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6748.320000000001s)]
*  But what was really really insane I don't know exactly where this is in the video [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6750.400000000001s)]
*  so I'd show you but he turns to us as we go and says hey let me walk ahead of you [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6754.24s)]
*  for this section. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6761.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6762.639999999999s)]
*  Why. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6763.08s)]
*  And he was like because last week I almost got bombed here and I was like what does [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6763.92s)]
*  that what does that mean. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6770.92s)]
*  He was like yeah so me and the other guides that take people down here in this [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6771.72s)]
*  catacombs we we don't like each other and we don't like sharing clients. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6775.5199999999995s)]
*  So if I got if I was able to you know kill off all the other people that were down [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6780.4s)]
*  here then I get all the clientele and I was like what what what are we in here. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6785.08s)]
*  We've already been with this guy for two hours and he turns he's like let me show [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6789.44s)]
*  you something. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6792.36s)]
*  He goes behind this rock pulls out a bomb a pipe bomb a pipe bomb a little thing [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6793.32s)]
*  with like a fuse on it and it was like I found this because I almost triggered this [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6800.5199999999995s)]
*  four days ago. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6806.48s)]
*  And this would have killed me instantly and if this would have got that thing that [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6808.32s)]
*  thing. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6811.639999999999s)]
*  And it was booby trapped up there and he said if if you guys trigger those the walls [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6812.16s)]
*  are caving in and we're all going to die like and he was being a hundred serious [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6817.36s)]
*  and we were like we thought we were like no way that you're just joking with us. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6822.92s)]
*  He's like no if that goes off and you see another one like don't move at all. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6826.36s)]
*  I will try to disarm it and we'll keep going. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6831.639999999999s)]
*  But the level of intensity for that night was like so beyond anything because we're [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6834.52s)]
*  OK. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6840.04s)]
*  This is not like a scary we get lost whatever we could die. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6840.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6844.2s)]
*  Paranormal murdering people for the guide business for the guide business. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6844.72s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6849.320000000001s)]
*  Makes no sense. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6851.92s)]
*  So what is the most danger you feel like you've ever been in. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6853.320000000001s)]
*  Was it then. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6856.68s)]
*  Maybe then there was maybe like OK there's this one time we got held at gunpoint. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6857.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah that was probably most and that was really really this was four days before [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6864.28s)]
*  our arrest too. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6869.32s)]
*  So it's on the same usually when we did the the explore videos abandoned videos we [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6870.08s)]
*  would go and film like four to five like in one stint. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6873.96s)]
*  So this was like our Florida trip. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6876.679999999999s)]
*  We land it's like 8 a.m. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6878.679999999999s)]
*  9 a.m. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6880.4s)]
*  and we're hitting like our first spot which is this giant hotel giant like hospital [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6880.839999999999s)]
*  something like that. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6884.759999999999s)]
*  Right next to the highway. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6885.4s)]
*  And so basically we were there to film our video of course one of our main things back [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6886.5599999999995s)]
*  in the day was we had these explore stickers that we go put at the top of each one of [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6891.5199999999995s)]
*  these buildings. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6895.28s)]
*  And so we made our way to the roof and probably spend a little bit too much time on top [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6896.4s)]
*  of the building where everybody could see us. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6902.08s)]
*  And so we knew we already had to you know lay low as we were like leaving and we're [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6904.44s)]
*  leaving this building and as we go out we see a lady on the front of the building. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6909.28s)]
*  As we go out we see a lady on the property with an orange vest and she's walking towards [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6913.32s)]
*  us. So before you know we can do anything we just decided to run. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6918.08s)]
*  And so we ran the opposite direction and there was like a little fence that we could hop [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6922.4s)]
*  behind us. And so we hopped it into what we thought was like a private property of like [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6926.08s)]
*  an office building space or there was like building big buildings and like a big parking [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6930.2s)]
*  lot and stuff literally this like that's where we're at. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6934.679999999999s)]
*  And as we're trying to leave this like office building what we thought we had four officers [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6937.639999999999s)]
*  run up to us right here where this is like the front gate with guns saying like get on [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6943.44s)]
*  the ground like you guys are so fucked like all this stuff that we were like whoa whoa [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6947.96s)]
*  we've been doing abandoned forever we've been caught before but like never been held at [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6952.5599999999995s)]
*  gunpoint. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6956.36s)]
*  Calls in and then like two or three more cops come in and circle us. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6957.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah it's serious. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6961.48s)]
*  And like the one guy is standing far because I don't know he's point or whatever and then [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6962.16s)]
*  two other guys rush us. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6965.4s)]
*  They both take our heads and like are like you guys are absolutely fucked. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6967.16s)]
*  They put me and like just shove my face up against this fence and like grind it up against [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6970.92s)]
*  this. I don't care who you are. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6975.2s)]
*  You guys are fucked. You're gonna go down. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6976.5599999999995s)]
*  I got you. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6977.799999999999s)]
*  We're like whoa whoa whoa whoa what is going on like what like we're just filming our daily [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=6978.5599999999995s)]

*  Just do the video footage. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7014.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7016.08s)]
*  It is crazy. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7016.799999999999s)]
*  So yeah after like you know getting screamed at in our faces and like guns pointed. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7017.5599999999995s)]
*  It was the first time I looked down the barrel of a gun for sure. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7021.839999999999s)]
*  And I was like OK this is serious. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7024.24s)]
*  I need to not do this. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7026.24s)]
*  And they thought you were terrorists. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7026.96s)]
*  They thought we were terrorists. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7028.0s)]
*  They thought you were going to blow up a school or something. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7028.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7030.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7031.24s)]
*  So was there someone else that was at the school. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7031.92s)]
*  No I mean the school part was on the other property and it was in session. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7035.48s)]
*  It was like an elementary school that was fine. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7040.8s)]
*  We were in an abandoned hospital on the other lot. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7042.68s)]
*  So was there just some crossed wires in terms of like how someone was reporting what was [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7045.04s)]
*  going on. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7049.6s)]
*  Yeah I guess I think what they just saw was like two random guys you know protect like [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7050.599999999999s)]
*  you know they have to protect their elementary school. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7056.599999999999s)]
*  They're seeing two guys that are like older with black clothing on backpacks and they're [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7058.32s)]
*  like assume the worst immediately. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7063.599999999999s)]
*  And so it makes sense. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7065.84s)]
*  It makes sense. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7066.96s)]
*  It's a code red code red. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7067.599999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7068.92s)]
*  We were in the wrong but we just didn't know we were in the wrong. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7069.44s)]
*  God I got it. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7072.76s)]
*  I got it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7073.5199999999995s)]
*  I got it. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7073.88s)]
*  So then they call. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7074.28s)]
*  So we learned that they were just school officers that honestly I don't know how they [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7075.48s)]
*  had even weapons on them. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7080.639999999999s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense but they ended up calling like the deputies and the sheriff of [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7082.12s)]
*  like the actual police. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7086.84s)]
*  And then the sheriff came over and was like what's the situation boys. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7088.36s)]
*  We're just like we explained we were just exploring that not the school or whatever. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7091.88s)]
*  And he was just like you're free to go. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7096.08s)]
*  The two days they were got arrested. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7098.5199999999995s)]
*  So if we didn't take that as like a bad sign. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7099.84s)]
*  No not even two days later. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7102.48s)]
*  So like after that we were like hearts pumping. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7103.92s)]
*  It's going crazy. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7106.68s)]
*  We hop in the car go to our next abandoned spot film that one. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7107.28s)]
*  Wow. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7110.36s)]
*  Forty five minutes after. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7111.32s)]
*  We're like this ain't going to stop us. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7114.32s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7115.92s)]
*  OK. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7117.84s)]
*  But what about in terms of like being in a haunted environment. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7118.24s)]
*  When have you felt like you were the most in danger. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7122.52s)]
*  Oh devil's chair is a crazy story. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7125.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7128.400000000001s)]
*  OK. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7129.64s)]
*  So since we've been doing this a long time it takes more and more for us to feel like [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7129.88s)]
*  we're in danger. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7134.320000000001s)]
*  A lot of the times when we're getting these things like I said at the beginning it's more [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7135.320000000001s)]
*  exciting. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7138.6s)]
*  It's more like if I can somehow prove to myself that this exists then I'm like intrigued. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7139.52s)]
*  But this time I was definitely not intrigued. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7145.12s)]
*  You said you went to Zach Bagans Museum. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7147.84s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7149.52s)]
*  How did you like that. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7150.200000000001s)]
*  Well the museum is amazing. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7151.4800000000005s)]
*  It's incredible that it's two hours long like when I heard it was a house in Vegas and then [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7153.240000000001s)]
*  it's a two hour tour I'm like how. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7158.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7160.92s)]
*  How's it to our tour. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7161.320000000001s)]
*  There's so much shit there. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7162.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7165.4800000000005s)]
*  And there's so many things from serial killers and so many different like haunted pieces [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7165.92s)]
*  of memorabilia and there's the bed where Lamar Odom. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7172.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7177.0s)]
*  We had an overdose which is weird like why is this here. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7177.56s)]
*  We ended up laying in that. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7181.240000000001s)]
*  We were the first to lay in that ever. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7182.240000000001s)]
*  Which is the first. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7185.200000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7186.120000000001s)]
*  Lamar might have laid in there afterwards. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7187.4400000000005s)]
*  No after like sitting in it we're like what are we sitting down probably. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7190.36s)]
*  Like what type of liquids are there. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7194.84s)]
*  A lot. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7196.28s)]
*  But imagine like gathering all that stuff and putting it in one place. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7197.32s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7201.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7201.84s)]
*  You know I wonder how that's affected Zach. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7202.32s)]
*  Because like what is that box in the center. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7205.4800000000005s)]
*  The Dibbock. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7209.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7210.2s)]
*  What is that. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7210.96s)]
*  What's the story behind that. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7211.6s)]
*  So the Dibbock and like Jewish Jewish folklore is apparently like a wandering spirit. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7213.32s)]
*  A lot of people say it's a demon. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7218.36s)]
*  That's me. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7220.92s)]
*  OK. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7223.56s)]
*  They're talking about the Dibbock box. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7223.92s)]
*  Maybe a little picture of it. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7225.84s)]
*  But yeah. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7226.8s)]
*  So anyway so apparently this this Dibbock box is said to be able to trap a spirit inside of it. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7227.16s)]
*  And that way it's not going to be haunting a location. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7233.56s)]
*  I don't know exactly because a lot of these Dibbock boxes are now like just fake random things that people put around. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7235.76s)]
*  This one in particular I think was like the most rare like the original one like where the idea came from. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7246.200000000001s)]
*  And that's why people say it's like the most haunted box in the world. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7252.8s)]
*  And whether or not you believe that there has been so many people that have touched that box and immediately passed out. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7255.8s)]
*  Or said as soon as they walked in they had bad luck for the next week. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7262.0s)]
*  Even like I know Post Malone always talks about his story like touching. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7265.4400000000005s)]
*  Talked about it on this podcast. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7269.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7271.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. If you go to the Zach's Museum it's him on the podcast. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7271.92s)]
*  They played a video of. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7276.200000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7277.400000000001s)]
*  Talking about his. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7277.84s)]
*  Oh I remember seeing that. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7278.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7279.76s)]
*  There it is. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7281.12s)]
*  So when you were when I was there there there's a feeling when you go in that room that I'm saying to myself OK. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7282.320000000001s)]
*  Am I mind fucking myself like is this is this me going oh this box is haunted so you should feel weird like this is this bullshit like. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7292.200000000001s)]
*  But it didn't feel good. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7301.64s)]
*  It felt like I should probably get the fuck out of here. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7303.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what I felt like when I was around that box I was like I don't think I want to be here. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7307.68s)]
*  But was that because it's I mean the setting is really cool. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7312.320000000001s)]
*  Like what he's done with that museum is really fun. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7317.360000000001s)]
*  I recommend it. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7321.08s)]
*  If you're in Vegas and you got some time during the day and you don't feel like blowing all your money at the slot machines go there because it's really entertaining. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7321.92s)]
*  Super cool. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7329.6s)]
*  And the tour is very cool. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7330.2s)]
*  They do a great job with the tour. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7332.16s)]
*  But there's so much stuff there. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7333.96s)]
*  There's so much haunted shit and so much memorabilia even if you don't believe in ghosts. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7336.6s)]
*  I mean they have memorabilia from. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7342.4s)]
*  Tell like Ted Bundy and Charles Manson and Ed Gain and celebrities like past not even from like serial killers but just they have the bus where the fucking doctor death was killing people in it. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7345.84s)]

*  There's so much weird shit in that museum that you walk out of like you get out of it. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7377.919999999999s)]
*  And you saw the clips they play. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7385.12s)]
*  They literally play clips there of people fainting and yeah vomiting and stuff. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7386.5199999999995s)]

*  Yes. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7392.4s)]
*  First five minutes that this is going to be horrible. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7392.799999999999s)]
*  No there's legit footage of people that are patrons that are just customers who go there and faint. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7394.88s)]
*  Often. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7401.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7401.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7402.320000000001s)]

*  I was like what is going on. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7406.8s)]

*  But all that. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7429.04s)]
*  But just the way they set it up how it's all the music and the dark rooms and the weird lighting it's flickering and it's a great job. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7429.639999999999s)]
*  He does a great job with it. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7438.5599999999995s)]

*  It's a good time. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7441.24s)]
*  But you know it's like you're the whole time you're saying like how much of this is just my mind playing tricks on me. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7442.24s)]
*  Yeah and there's definitely a part of that to every haunted location you go into it's like you know what you're getting yourself into. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7449.36s)]
*  And so you're kind of expecting and or opening yourself up to having those types of experiences. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7456.24s)]
*  Well has there ever been a time where you knew that you were opening yourself up to these things but it still shocked you. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7461.16s)]
*  Tell them that was crazy. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7467.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7469.28s)]
*  At that location just you know for example so in Zach Banging's museum one of the most if not the most haunted object in the whole museum I don't know if you saw it probably [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7469.68s)]
*  did the devil's rocking chair. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7478.76s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7480.24s)]
*  So we actually were able to give us permission. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7481.08s)]
*  We were the first people besides him and his team to sit in this chair. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7484.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7488.0s)]
*  So basically that was that was the only exhibit that he's ever had to close. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7488.320000000001s)]
*  Those girls. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7492.76s)]
*  They're terrified. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7493.72s)]
*  Look at their faces. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7495.16s)]
*  Look at the. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7496.52s)]
*  Ah. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7496.88s)]
*  Look at their faces. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7498.16s)]
*  That looks so real. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7499.24s)]
*  Like why did you bring us here. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7501.400000000001s)]
*  With you guys. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7503.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7504.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7504.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7506.040000000001s)]
*  That he had shut down that museum because that exhibit specifically because a lot of people were like complaining about you know getting nauseous or throwing up or something like that. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7506.52s)]
*  It's apparently the only artifact that he had to close off in that museum. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7515.96s)]
*  But for some reason he was like super nice to us and was like guys besides me no one sat in that sense the exorcism that had occurred on that chair. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7521.240000000001s)]
*  So if you guys want to you guys can sit in it for the first time ever. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7530.200000000001s)]
*  And that was one of those times like we're down to push the limit and stuff like that. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7534.4800000000005s)]
*  But that was one of those times that I actually like gather myself and be like we can do it. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7539.04s)]
*  Like let's figure this out. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7544.160000000001s)]
*  Let's like not actually like overthink about it. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7545.320000000001s)]
*  So what is. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7550.4800000000005s)]
*  What are you talking to. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7552.64s)]
*  Like when you saying you've gone too far like you have headphones on and you have your blindfold on. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7554.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7559.72s)]
*  So what's going on. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7560.0s)]
*  So this is one of like our favorite experiments. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7560.84s)]
*  It's called the S.S. method. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7563.16s)]
*  It relies on the theory that if you take away certain senses other ones are enhanced. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7564.28s)]
*  And so there's this thing called a spirit box that like shuffles through different radio frequencies. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7570.24s)]
*  And what I'm doing is I'm like focusing on like whatever it says and I can't hear the questions that Colby and what are you hearing something in your ears. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7576.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7585.08s)]
*  Well I'm hearing radio static basically. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7585.48s)]
*  So. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7587.4s)]
*  Hello. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7589.44s)]
*  Really really. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7589.64s)]
*  Every once while we'll break into a radio station where it'll be like a song or something that like will be something saying saying or like just a word will pop out. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7590.36s)]
*  But mostly you just hear static. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7597.719999999999s)]
*  And these are like noise canceling headphones and I can't see what they're saying. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7599.44s)]
*  So it's basically you're blindfolded. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7603.16s)]
*  You have this thing on it's static and occasionally sounds come through their words. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7604.96s)]
*  Correct. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7610.08s)]
*  And so you're just repeating those words. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7610.679999999999s)]
*  Well so I'm out. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7612.599999999999s)]
*  I'm like watching him and I'm asking questions out and whatever is there is supposed to use the S.S. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7613.88s)]
*  Method or like you Sam basically as the vessel to speak on to it. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7619.52s)]
*  So for example I'd be like like are you here right now. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7624.160000000001s)]
*  And then he'd be like yes over there or something like that. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7626.6s)]
*  And so you're in this haunted rocking chair and you're using this method with blindfolds on and the earplugs. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7629.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7636.56s)]
*  Basically it's a sensory deprive myself so that no matter what I couldn't be just faking an answer and hearing what he said and say something random. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7636.88s)]
*  So the theory is yes there will be other random words that happen because radio frequencies however but down to the coincidence coincidence theory. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7644.04s)]
*  If things make sense over and over and over again to the questions that he's asking then that is said to be more paranormal. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7654.16s)]
*  So what did it feel like for you to be sitting in that creepy chair. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7660.96s)]
*  So during that it was a whole different world. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7664.6s)]
*  But what was really really interesting is like like Colby said after doing this a lot like it takes a lot for us to have a physical reaction. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7667.72s)]
*  Although yes I was definitely terrified because of all the the lore and the stories that were being told all up and to this point the guy is telling us a hundred times. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7676.04s)]
*  No one has ever done this before. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7685.32s)]
*  You're about to be the first. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7687.2s)]
*  It's terrifying but sitting down on that chair for the first time I think ever gave me a feeling of almost being paralyzed. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7688.2s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever been like hypnotized. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7697.4s)]
*  Have you been hypnotized. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7699.5599999999995s)]
*  So the feeling of being in hypnosis was almost immediate as soon as I like sat down there not when I was in the doing that like experiment but prior to that where I couldn't necessarily feel my legs as much. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7700.84s)]
*  And yes like if you gave me you know like ultimatum if you have to stand up right now or you're going to die I could stand up. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7714.36s)]
*  But you know like if you've been under hypnosis it's like this pressure that you probably shouldn't do this or that your your mind is being swayed to do something else. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7721.24s)]
*  And to me that pressure was don't stand up. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7729.0s)]
*  So you felt like you're under spell. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7731.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7733.799999999999s)]
*  And like the same thing with hypnosis I've been hypnotized before. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7734.639999999999s)]
*  And like I said if everything in my being wanted to stand up. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7737.96s)]
*  Yeah I can stand up or I can not listen to like what's happening. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7741.639999999999s)]
*  However if you allow yourself to like feel that the feeling was paralyzing and I like run a lot. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7744.32s)]
*  So I always like use this as an example it felt as though within seconds of sitting down on that chair I had run five ten miles. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7750.599999999999s)]
*  Like it felt like I was sore and like my legs were like real you know like that like almost like sluggish feeling to like your your muscles after like a big workout. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7760.08s)]
*  That's what I felt almost immediately. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7769.400000000001s)]
*  It was like so bizarre and I'd never felt like that before and still to this day since that chair I had never felt like that either. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7771.400000000001s)]
*  So when it comes to all of your paranormal experiences that chair was the freakiest to you. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7779.4400000000005s)]
*  That chair was the most physically changing. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7785.32s)]
*  Again I think the most the freakiest moments are always the beginning because it's the first time you ever hear anything. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7789.0s)]
*  So that Queen Mary story was what changed my psyche the most. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7794.16s)]
*  That one was the most physically. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7797.64s)]
*  Don't forget about the Robert the doll location though. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7799.4800000000005s)]
*  There was a time I've never seen Sam like almost like throw up from and that was a huge physical reaction that just happened. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7802.56s)]
*  That just happened. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7808.6s)]
*  I've never. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7809.2s)]
*  Is this a new one. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7809.64s)]
*  This is a newer one. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7810.400000000001s)]
*  We just came out with it last month. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7811.68s)]
*  Apparently Robert the doll if you don't know the story. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7813.92s)]
*  Have you ever heard of Annabelle. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7816.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7817.64s)]
*  So Annabelle is a movie movie franchise is based on a real doll. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7817.96s)]
*  So the real doll is like apparently the second most haunted in the world and Robert is the number one most haunted in the world. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7821.8s)]
*  And so when it's more haunted apparently that's what people say. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7828.0s)]
*  Once he get in his movie he's got plenty of movies about him. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7831.4400000000005s)]
*  He's just got a plain face. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7835.0s)]
*  He needs better. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7836.12s)]
*  I look on it. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7836.96s)]
*  Yeah we blurred it. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7839.72s)]
*  We blurred it for purposes but if you want to just Google image. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7841.2s)]
*  Because it's because you're not supposed to take pictures or film it. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7843.76s)]
*  That's like the biggest no no. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7847.96s)]
*  And we're obviously there filming a YouTube video. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7849.04s)]
*  And funny enough like going back to Zach James. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7851.200000000001s)]
*  It's creepy. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7854.280000000001s)]
*  If you see a little in the eyes like you get cursed. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7856.4400000000005s)]
*  And so it's the same thing with this this doll. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7859.72s)]
*  And so we blurred it for like our fans. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7862.240000000001s)]
*  So your fans don't get cursed. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7864.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7865.68s)]
*  What the fuck Jamie don't curse me. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7867.64s)]
*  You want me to show it on this on the show. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7869.240000000001s)]
*  No it's interesting is like obviously there's all those stories whatever. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7874.64s)]
*  So what really gets us is when people have like their own personal experiences that they come and talk about. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7879.08s)]
*  Well we didn't realize is how many people had experiences with doll. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7885.0s)]
*  They calculated to more than 10,000 people have written in apology letters to Robert to ask for forgiveness because of the curse that he put on them. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7888.400000000001s)]
*  Ten thousand individuals like maybe even if 50 percent of those are bullshit there are five thousand people out there that genuinely believe they have been cursed by this doll by taking a picture of it. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7898.719999999999s)]
*  Including Ozzy Ozzy Osborne. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7910.36s)]
*  What Ozzy wrote a letter. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7912.36s)]
*  Yeah it wasn't a letter. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7914.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7915.84s)]
*  I think he has Parkinson's right now. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7919.2s)]
*  I believe he blames that on Robert the doll because the story is he there's like a big like touristy shop. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7921.0s)]
*  At the end and he bought like one of the little Robert the doll plushies and like put it in a microwave and make fun of it and stuff and then claims that he got Parkinson's because of that. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7928.2s)]
*  Well a lot of people get Parkinson's without that Ozzy Ozborne blames year of hell on haunted doll. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7938.72s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7945.12s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7947.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7949.36s)]
*  The Black Sabbath rocker was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease last year and underwent spinal surgery following a fall at his home makes the claim this family's new really really TV show reality TV show I guess it should have said the Osborne's want to believe the show sees his son Jack 34 trying to persuade Ozzy 71 mom Sharon 68 and sister Kelly 35 to believe in the paranormal including ghosts UFOs fairies and werewolves. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7950.08s)]
*  One episode sees Jack produce a doll named Robert that he reveals is the original doll that inspired the Chucky horror movie franchise. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7979.12s)]
*  Jack says of the actual story Robert the doll is that it's cursed by the spirit of his owner. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7987.04s)]
*  If you disrespect him make fun of him take a picture without asking or even handle him you'll be cursed and terrible things begin to happen in your life. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=7992.639999999999s)]
*  Ozzy throws the doll the floor saying he is a fucking joke. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8000.719999999999s)]
*  It's bad luck. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8004.5599999999995s)]
*  I keep telling you you keep thinking is fucking not. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8006.0s)]
*  But just look at what I'm saying. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8010.08s)]
*  Just look at what's going on with me. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8012.08s)]
*  You think it's a joke. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8014.44s)]
*  Just look at me. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8016.599999999999s)]
*  It ain't bad luck. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8018.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8020.5599999999995s)]
*  Ozzy in here. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8020.839999999999s)]
*  Well fuck that doll. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8023.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8025.5199999999995s)]
*  No I don't want none of that doll. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8025.96s)]
*  No thank you. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8027.5199999999995s)]
*  But that's why we blurred his face. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8027.919999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8029.16s)]
*  So you were in the presence of this doll. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8029.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8031.919999999999s)]
*  And what is it like to be around this doll. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8032.599999999999s)]
*  It's definitely weird because like we've been in a lot of haunted places but it's different when you're dealing with haunted objects. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8034.679999999999s)]
*  It's not like oh this the building and the vibe we're in is haunted. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8042.4s)]
*  It's more like this specific thing that's in front of me. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8045.719999999999s)]
*  And what is the story behind this doll. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8048.28s)]
*  Like why is it supposedly haunted. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8049.96s)]
*  So this guy gave it to like a three and a half foot tall doll. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8053.0s)]
*  It's like a life size type of doll. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8058.04s)]
*  It's really weird. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8059.44s)]
*  He gave it to his son and this the son's name was Robert Otto. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8060.44s)]
*  It was like Jean Robert. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8066.12s)]
*  Jean Robert Otto or Robert Jean Otto. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8067.24s)]
*  And he gave his first name and his clothes to this doll. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8070.44s)]
*  And so the kid and the doll became best friends for years and years and years. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8074.5199999999995s)]
*  And he basically embodied this guy and just became Robert himself. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8078.76s)]
*  But over the course of his childhood and all the way up until I think he left his parents house to go to college. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8084.48s)]
*  He would have horrible things happen to him because of this doll. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8090.28s)]
*  And this doll was allegedly taken from like Germany at this shop. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8093.76s)]
*  The same company. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8098.96s)]
*  It was called the Stief. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8099.96s)]
*  The same company that created like the original teddy bear. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8101.36s)]
*  Created this doll. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8104.08s)]
*  So from the original teddy bear company he brought this doll from Germany to give this guy in Florida. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8105.0s)]
*  And throughout his entire childhood like things like chairs would be moved. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8109.4s)]
*  Like all these horrible bad luck things would happen. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8115.36s)]
*  And like he would almost to the parents it would seem like he was arguing with someone in the room and they'd hear two voices. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8117.6s)]
*  And then when the parents would run into the room it was just him and the doll. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8124.200000000001s)]
*  And just creepy because the parents would say that they heard like their little kids voice and then like an older deep like man's voice. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8127.56s)]
*  Oh Christ. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8133.68s)]
*  Talking back and forth. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8134.88s)]
*  And apparently that was Robert. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8135.72s)]
*  But the big theory about Robert is that he was also one of these like even gore in an object sort of like I don't know creatures I guess puppets I guess you could say. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8136.76s)]
*  Because Jean would always blame everything that he did wrong on the doll. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8146.08s)]
*  So like if he was like if you know furniture would be like all around his room or whatever his parents would come try to ground him he'd be like no Robert did it. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8151.32s)]
*  And so all that negativity going towards this doll for his entire life like this is why people believe that it has like evil to it. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8159.2s)]
*  Manifested this evil. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8167.28s)]
*  It's supposed to be bad. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8168.4s)]
*  And being outside your child's room and you hear your kid talking and you hear someone responding. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8169.48s)]
*  Get old man just low voice. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8175.88s)]
*  No that's not what we're going to do Billy. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8178.4s)]
*  I would cry. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8181.599999999999s)]
*  And then you open up the door and it's just the doll sitting there with your kid. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8182.16s)]
*  And it looks like that. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8185.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah that's a dead faced doll too. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8186.84s)]
*  There's something creepy about the lack of expression that doll for real. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8189.36s)]
*  That's the crazy thing too is like our guides there were saying that it will like swallow every once in a while. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8192.6s)]
*  You could see it blink and stuff. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8198.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8200.44s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8200.960000000001s)]
*  That stuff. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8201.92s)]
*  What's crazy is like this same guy he went off to be an artist and he did his whole career and when he was like in his older age he came back to the house. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8202.640000000001s)]
*  And for like 10 or 15 years he kept this doll upstairs in his attic and put a whole like you know three foot version of his house upstairs to like a short couch and a short desk. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8210.880000000001s)]
*  All for Robert. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8221.96s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8223.199999999999s)]
*  And have conversations for hours and hours on end. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8224.439999999999s)]
*  So this old man is having this conversation with the doll in a like a smaller version of a living room. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8228.599999999999s)]
*  So so terrifying. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8235.0s)]
*  As rumor would have it the autos and their servants would often hear Jean in his bedroom having conversations with himself in two entirely different voices. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8238.08s)]
*  Furthermore the autos would wake up in the middle of the night to Jean screaming only to find the frightened boy in bed surrounded by overturned furniture. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8248.0s)]
*  Jean would blame Robert the doll for messing up the bedroom while Robert would glare at Jean from the foot of the bed. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8257.88s)]
*  Soon after mutilated toys and mysterious happenings would appear in the home only to have Jean proclaim each time Robert did it. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8266.599999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8274.199999999999s)]
*  Imagine if that's real. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8275.039999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8276.64s)]
*  Like what if like a demon can manifest itself inside of a doll occasionally just every now and then a little fucking opening in the dimensions pops out. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8277.32s)]
*  This thing manages to it can't assume a physical form but it can sort of embody itself in some sort of an object like a doll something cute. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8286.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8300.36s)]
*  Which is so terrifying too because you know when it's a little doll or something cute or whatever like a lot of these things that you say is like a little girl spirit or something. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8301.279999999999s)]
*  It's like cute. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8308.599999999999s)]
*  It's like oh it's innocent. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8309.359999999999s)]
*  Like I want to open up to that. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8310.32s)]
*  But then boom. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8311.599999999999s)]
*  Like maybe it's not. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8312.72s)]
*  That's why Chucky was such a fucking great movie. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8313.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8316.32s)]
*  You know to have that thing. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8316.92s)]
*  I mean oh this doll I think is what's said to have been inspired. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8319.76s)]
*  You know like Chucky inspired got inspired from. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8323.56s)]
*  And the Annabelle movie is about a real doll too. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8326.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8329.279999999999s)]
*  So that's a real doll that's in Ed and Lorraine Warren's museum that they've kept like away for many years. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8329.84s)]
*  They even have a priest once a day come and bless the doll because they're scared of what it does to people one time every day. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8336.96s)]
*  I think every single day. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8342.64s)]
*  Maybe the priest. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8343.24s)]
*  He's got a racket going on. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8344.08s)]
*  Listen I gotta keep coming back. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8345.24s)]
*  Can we see if Annabelle the doll what it really looks like. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8347.56s)]
*  The real haunted Annabelle doll. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8352.0s)]
*  It looks like a rag doll. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8353.64s)]
*  A rag rag doll. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8354.92s)]
*  It's the same thing right. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8355.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8356.4s)]
*  That's it. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8356.68s)]
*  Yeah I think that's it. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8357.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8358.08s)]
*  So that's not nearly as creepy as Annabelle in the movie. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8358.44s)]
*  It's like Raggedy Ann. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8360.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8361.44s)]
*  That seems pretty normal. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8362.16s)]
*  Yeah exactly. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8363.560000000001s)]
*  And so the Annabelle in the movie is fucking horrible looking. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8364.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8368.04s)]
*  The real Annabelle doll. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8368.6s)]
*  Now look at Annabelle in the movie. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8370.16s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8371.68s)]
*  The Annabelle in the movie is so terrifying. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8372.720000000001s)]
*  So they did a great job of making her creepier. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8375.52s)]
*  Very much so. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8378.720000000001s)]
*  This sounds like a good job. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8379.44s)]
*  There's a few of those Annabelle movies right. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8380.560000000001s)]
*  If they made the whole movie with that thing that would be creepy too. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8382.76s)]
*  Oh my. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8385.68s)]
*  Nah. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8386.12s)]
*  It would have been weird. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8386.52s)]
*  I wouldn't be scared of that bitch ass Raggedy Ann. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8387.6s)]
*  Go say that to her face. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8390.960000000001s)]
*  I'd be like sit down. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8393.160000000002s)]
*  Shut up before I light you on fire. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8394.28s)]
*  Yeah but Annabelle the one on the left freaks me out. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8396.84s)]
*  Yeah that's freaky. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8399.6s)]
*  When we're by Robert the doll just to finish that story. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8400.44s)]
*  So we all split up like Colby's saying like recently we've been splitting up a lot. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8405.2s)]
*  To scare each other more. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8410.52s)]
*  Just to scare each other more. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8411.400000000001s)]
*  But part of the museum so the entire museum is kind of like Zach Bates museum. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8413.960000000001s)]
*  It has a bunch of different artifacts and it was a fort actually for a war. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8417.039999999999s)]
*  Blank. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8422.359999999999s)]
*  What museum is this. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8422.56s)]
*  It's called Fort East Martello and like it's mainly just filled with a bunch of [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8423.599999999999s)]
*  haunted objects. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8427.839999999998s)]
*  And where's that at. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8428.599999999999s)]
*  It's in the Keys. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8429.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8430.16s)]
*  Florida Keys. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8430.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8431.199999999999s)]
*  Key West. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8432.519999999999s)]
*  So there's a section of this fort that used to store all the bodies that like had [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8433.08s)]
*  died during you know whatever said war it was. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8439.279999999999s)]
*  And I was walking down through this corridor and we were there for probably [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8442.519999999999s)]
*  like 30 minutes or something like that. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8446.56s)]
*  Definitely hearing sounds a lot of like weird creepy things. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8448.08s)]
*  Again sometimes the equipment goes off and that's definitely interesting. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8451.119999999999s)]
*  It was definitely put me on edge but I had a feeling that I'd never gotten before. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8454.48s)]
*  And out of actually like nowhere I hadn't like felt nauseous or anything like that. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8459.0s)]
*  Out of nowhere I just turned the corner and I'm looking down this hallway and I [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8465.039999999999s)]
*  just immediately start dry heaving. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8468.439999999999s)]
*  Like I'm like gagging throwing up or whatever like that. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8470.32s)]
*  And I just like it wasn't even for I don't know I wasn't even thinking about the video [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8473.16s)]
*  I just immediately left the area. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8477.92s)]
*  I didn't think about it and I walk outside and the guys the tour guide or whatever is [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8479.2s)]
*  on the outside of the premise and he like sees me and he's like dude your your face [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8483.12s)]
*  is white. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8486.64s)]
*  Like what what went on. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8487.48s)]
*  I was like I truly don't know. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8488.64s)]
*  I've never had a reaction like nauseousness or anything like that. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8489.64s)]
*  And I genuinely just like out of nowhere gagged probably like 10 times. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8493.6s)]
*  Dry heave. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8496.76s)]
*  Dry heave. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8497.32s)]
*  Nothing came up. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8497.6s)]
*  It was just like weirdly dry heaving. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8498.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8500.48s)]
*  You were choking on nothing. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8500.8s)]
*  It was like disgusting. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8501.48s)]
*  But what was scary is like so it was me and my buddy Nate that who we know since high [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8502.960000000001s)]
*  school he's been one of our best friends forever. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8507.44s)]
*  So we've known Sam since he was 15 type thing. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8509.24s)]
*  We've both never seen Sam ever act like that. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8512.28s)]
*  It got so bad that Nate and I were doing like our own like individual investigations and [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8514.84s)]
*  the guide came and got me and was like you should go check on your buddy outside. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8519.76s)]
*  Like he's like throwing up outside and I run out there and yeah. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8524.24s)]
*  What people don't like always forget about is it doesn't just affect us in the moment [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8528.76s)]
*  but we get done filming and we have these things called paranormal hangovers where it [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8532.48s)]
*  affects us for a long time like days after. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8537.08s)]
*  But this is the moment. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8539.880000000001s)]
*  Paranormal hang paranormal hangover. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8541.08s)]
*  The world's most haunted doll. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8544.68s)]
*  He's just gagging. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8547.0s)]
*  So this is after being in Robert's presence. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8548.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8550.84s)]
*  This is the end of the night. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8551.4s)]
*  How close were you to Robert? [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8552.56s)]
*  So they unfortunately wouldn't let us touch it. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8553.76s)]
*  But unfortunately unfortunately they put like a plexiglass. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8556.56s)]
*  Yeah right there. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8563.76s)]
*  So it's probably about a two and a half. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8564.72s)]
*  Two and a half. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8566.24s)]
*  He's buying that glass. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8566.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8567.2s)]
*  And this is all in the keys. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8567.84s)]
*  Is that place as cool as Zach's museum? [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8569.16s)]
*  I would say that specific doll is super super famous but Zach has definitely put on a cooler [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8572.16s)]
*  environment. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8578.32s)]
*  Zach has more. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8579.6s)]
*  Way more. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8580.92s)]
*  Way more. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8581.64s)]
*  Like hundreds of more things. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8581.96s)]
*  Two hours of stuff that you walk through in a house. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8583.039999999999s)]
*  It's pretty impressive. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8588.64s)]
*  But this seems pretty creepy too. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8589.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah you got to see this place too. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8590.759999999998s)]
*  It's super awesome. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8592.119999999999s)]
*  This place. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8593.839999999998s)]
*  This. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8594.359999999999s)]
*  You just say it used to be a fort. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8594.839999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8596.8s)]
*  It looks like a fort. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8597.199999999999s)]
*  It looks pretty dope. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8598.4s)]
*  And so you encounter Robert and then you start. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8599.679999999998s)]
*  What is the feeling. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8604.08s)]
*  Was it immediate. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8605.919999999998s)]
*  No. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8607.0s)]
*  So I left Robert and I went off my own and I was probably 30 minutes from the time like [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8607.4s)]
*  I was even near Robert to the other area. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8613.039999999999s)]
*  So we don't know. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8614.96s)]
*  But the theory goes after afterwards we talk into the tour guide and be like what could [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8615.72s)]
*  have that been like was that Robert. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8619.439999999999s)]
*  He's like maybe. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8620.88s)]
*  But the people that were buried there in that corridor died of yellow fever. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8622.199999999999s)]
*  And so or most of them did. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8627.919999999998s)]
*  And the last little part of yellow fever is like you're throwing up blood over and over [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8629.679999999998s)]
*  and over again. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8636.199999999999s)]
*  Black blood. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8636.679999999998s)]
*  Gold or whatever like that. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8637.679999999998s)]
*  And then you die. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8638.56s)]
*  So like you're you're experiencing their last moments. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8639.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8644.64s)]
*  So it's a traumatic energy of the last breaths and the last times of all these people's [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8644.96s)]
*  lives was then reflected onto me. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8650.52s)]
*  That might even be more fucked than Robert. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8653.48s)]
*  I definitely think so because the yellow fever if you dive into that like it's gruesome. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8656.08s)]
*  I was telling you about my stepdad having that experience at Gettysburg. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8661.64s)]
*  I would imagine that if enough people will die in an area there's I mean if that's real [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8664.480000000001s)]
*  if things can have a memory you would think that there'd be something that just lingers [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8671.04s)]
*  on the last moments of your life you're throwing up blood and realizing this is the end. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8676.32s)]
*  You're in agony and you don't want to leave. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8682.640000000001s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8685.640000000001s)]
*  Like if your last moment alive it's like I don't want to die. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8686.16s)]
*  Then what if you accidentally like trap yourself. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8689.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8691.880000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8692.400000000001s)]
*  If you can't relax and say I'm ready I'm ready to go. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8692.720000000001s)]
*  You're not ready for the next part. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8696.480000000001s)]
*  It gets so meta and confusing because then yeah you know it's like if you're religious it's [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8699.0s)]
*  like well you would go to heaven but it's like how do you know like spirits don't have the [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8703.2s)]
*  the opportunity to walk around earth for a little bit before they move on to the light. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8707.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8711.720000000001s)]
*  I'd be God if I knew. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8712.800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8713.880000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's like a consciousness to being a spirit and maybe you got to get your shit [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8714.2s)]
*  together as a spirit before they let you go. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8717.76s)]
*  And maybe some spirits are just losers and they just can't they just can't figure it out. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8721.240000000002s)]
*  There's no promotion involved. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8726.640000000001s)]
*  Did you. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8728.560000000001s)]
*  What did it feel like to look at Robert. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8729.160000000002s)]
*  That was really weird because when we came into the museum they had it covered so they had [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8733.0s)]
*  like a cloth over it and they offered us like do you want to see it. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8737.44s)]
*  Now we want to wait till we're on camera first. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8741.480000000001s)]
*  And you know again back to this hype up we had been researching this for the last week. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8743.44s)]
*  We'd heard all the horror stories. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8748.800000000001s)]
*  We just heard about the 10,000 apology letters and they even had us like read some of them. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8750.080000000002s)]
*  And then we get to look at it. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8754.880000000001s)]
*  It was like definitely like we shouldn't be here. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8756.080000000002s)]
*  It wasn't like I didn't think immediately we were in danger. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8758.640000000001s)]
*  However you know our dumbass is trying to get content. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8761.36s)]
*  We immediately were like all right as soon as we see him let's take a picture of him. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8764.960000000001s)]
*  And that's the one thing that you're not supposed to do. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8769.400000000001s)]
*  And so our disrespect or take pictures. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8771.400000000001s)]
*  Disrespectful. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8773.400000000001s)]
*  Our entire concept of the video was like you know you hear that if you take a picture of this [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8774.640000000001s)]
*  doll you're going to be cursed. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8778.88s)]
*  Let's test that theory. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8780.279999999999s)]
*  We didn't know. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8781.519999999999s)]
*  And so we were like all right as soon as we see this doll let's take a picture and throughout the [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8782.32s)]
*  night we'll see what happens. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8785.679999999998s)]
*  There were definitely was things that have happened but the main gist of it was like do we feel [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8787.0s)]
*  cursed after we took this picture. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8791.359999999999s)]
*  It's so easy for someone to dismiss that right. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8793.4s)]
*  But if there was just one doll one doll that was haunted all the other dolls are fine. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8795.92s)]
*  Dolls are fine. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8802.56s)]
*  What's wrong with you. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8803.4s)]
*  Come on Sam. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8804.64s)]
*  But then one fucking doll just one doll you look at that doll and there's something inside of that [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8806.36s)]
*  doll. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8811.12s)]
*  Here you see it winking. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8812.24s)]
*  How do you explain that to somebody. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8813.08s)]
*  Everybody else looks away and it just goes. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8814.92s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8817.560000000001s)]
*  Or you see it go. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8818.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8819.68s)]
*  Swallow. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8820.24s)]
*  Then you're the crazy one. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8821.560000000001s)]
*  What did you guys ever go to the Amityville Horror House. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8822.84s)]
*  They don't let you let you in there. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8825.36s)]
*  We've been trying to contact the owners for like years. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8827.12s)]
*  Really. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8829.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8830.12s)]
*  If they're going to invite. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8831.24s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8832.44s)]
*  Do people live in that house. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8833.0s)]
*  I think so. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8833.88s)]
*  I think it's just not even a business. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8834.279999999999s)]
*  It's just people live there and are like fuck off. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8836.359999999999s)]
*  I think that's one of the places that they change the address and the street so that people can find it. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8838.92s)]
*  Very recognizable because of the window pattern. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8844.119999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8848.24s)]
*  The windows look that movie scared the shit out of me. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8848.92s)]
*  When I was a kid. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8852.279999999999s)]
*  How much of that is like the movie is based on the truth or is it just made up. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8853.199999999999s)]
*  Remember like he broke through the wall and he went into the other side and there was like a demon. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8857.88s)]
*  Behind the wall or some shit. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8864.0s)]
*  I saw that movie when I was like 10 years old. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8866.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah it was a long time. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8868.119999999999s)]
*  Very vague recollection. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8869.08s)]
*  How old is that movie. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8871.4s)]
*  Amityville horror. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8872.72s)]

*  OK so I was like murders happened in 12. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8878.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8881.8s)]
*  Quick after the movies the murders rather like we need a fucking movie. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8882.32s)]
*  This is a sick story. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8886.32s)]
*  I mean they really capitalized pretty quick. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8889.359999999999s)]
*  They did. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8891.16s)]
*  That's all I remember is the murder part of it. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8891.92s)]
*  I don't remember if there is alleged demons during the real life version. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8893.52s)]
*  Yeah it was like a normal guy and then he lived in this house and killed his whole family. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8897.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8902.279999999999s)]
*  And then there was a thing you broke through the wall. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8903.199999999999s)]
*  I remember see if you can find the scene. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8906.24s)]
*  There's like a scene where he breaks through the wall and I remember that freaking me out as a 12 year old going by. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8908.52s)]
*  Like this idea of like you know your dad breaking through this hole in the wall. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8917.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8924.72s)]
*  What's it with the axes. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8926.16s)]
*  You know apparently every time I just do. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8927.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8929.4s)]
*  Well it's just a scary way to die. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8930.439999999999s)]
*  I think we're actually in the shine. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8932.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8934.599999999999s)]
*  Oh speaking of the shining. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8936.039999999999s)]
*  I'm home. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8937.48s)]
*  Have you ever been to the Stanley Hotel. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8938.96s)]
*  No I have not. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8940.64s)]
*  That's our most viewed video. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8942.0s)]
*  Magnificent hotel. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8943.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8944.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8944.92s)]
*  So the Stanley was the inspiration for the shining. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8945.960000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8950.36s)]
*  Correct. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8950.76s)]
*  And is that the Upstate New York Hotel or is it the Colorado. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8951.44s)]
*  That's all Colorado. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8954.960000000001s)]
*  It's an Estes Park which created the Estes method that we were just telling you. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8955.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8963.0s)]
*  So one of our episodes we went to the Stanley Hotel and interviewed the guy that created that experiment for the paranormal. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8963.2s)]
*  But the Stanley Hotel is pretty widely known as the most haunted place in the United States. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8969.72s)]
*  Hotel wise. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8975.4s)]
*  Hotel wise. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8976.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8976.96s)]
*  What did you guys experience there. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8977.2s)]
*  That was one of our first experiences ever. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8978.84s)]
*  I think that was like this. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8981.12s)]
*  Before we had equipment really. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8982.0s)]
*  Before we had equipment though that video is our most viewed video. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8983.2s)]
*  I think it was right after our like arrest and it wasn't like we got crazy equipment type of things but we heard what like scratching sounds and like different knocks on like doors and stuff. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8986.6s)]
*  And I think even our one of our cameras like flipped over or something. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=8998.16s)]
*  But that was four years ago or five years ago. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9001.28s)]
*  Well what's interesting about the Stanley is there's this part that's literally in the front room called the vortex where there's just a bunch of mirrors on each side that are pointed towards each other and the theory is in the paranormal world that that can create a portal. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9003.48s)]
*  Mirrors facing each other or like spirits can become trapped through mirrors and stuff. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9017.24s)]
*  And so that was like the coolest part of the entire place. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9022.88s)]
*  It's known to be a Disneyland resort for ghosts. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9026.28s)]
*  And so anything could like pass in there. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9030.0s)]
*  It's like a giant portal. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9032.039999999999s)]
*  There's one of the most famous paranormal pictures ever taken at the Stanley. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9033.24s)]
*  If you just type in like Stanley Hotel like ghost photo this is all over the news. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9036.32s)]
*  There's like staircase ghost or something. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9041.039999999999s)]
*  Staircase ghost is huge. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9042.92s)]
*  But yeah we just went recently back this last year. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9045.44s)]
*  We still haven't been able to get to the main room which was what The Shining was inspired by. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9048.84s)]

*  See right on the stairs. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9081.8s)]
*  That one hit the news because there's so many people that were right there and then for some reason. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9083.279999999999s)]
*  A little girl looks like. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9087.279999999999s)]
*  But everything's blurry. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9093.16s)]
*  Look that lady coming down the stairs is blurry. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9094.4s)]
*  A little bit of movement. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9096.599999999999s)]
*  Whatever in front of her is blur. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9097.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9099.359999999999s)]
*  True. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9099.8s)]
*  That picture sucks. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9101.24s)]
*  That kid's a ghost. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9102.08s)]
*  That kid talking to his mom's a ghost. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9103.359999999999s)]
*  She's a ghost. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9104.839999999998s)]
*  Everybody's a fucking ghost. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9105.519999999999s)]
*  That picture sucks. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9107.08s)]
*  Go back to the first one. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9108.4s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9109.32s)]
*  Yeah that picture sucks. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9110.32s)]
*  But that that one's weird. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9111.96s)]
*  So what is happening in this one. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9113.56s)]
*  I think it's the same. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9115.56s)]
*  It's supposed to just resemble the same area two times in a row. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9116.359999999999s)]
*  Having like a translucent figure. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9120.359999999999s)]
*  Again like pictures. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9123.119999999999s)]
*  You know I always like hit or miss and there's a lot of times that like people be like oh like an orb or something. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9125.119999999999s)]
*  As well there are a million phony Bigfoot pictures. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9130.199999999999s)]
*  What they call them squatches. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9133.72s)]
*  See shadows like look you could see a face and here's his armpit. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9136.24s)]
*  You know because people want to see things in still photos. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9140.4s)]
*  And there's some like like psychology behind like we're searching always searching for faces. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9144.32s)]
*  So we'll figure out a face on anything. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9149.24s)]
*  Sure on Mars. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9150.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9151.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9152.92s)]
*  People find faces and shadows on planets. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9153.279999999999s)]
*  You ever see the face on Mars. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9155.599999999999s)]
*  No I saw the see the face on the moon but not on Mars. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9157.48s)]
*  Yeah there was a guy named. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9160.679999999998s)]
*  Hoagland. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9162.96s)]
*  Richard Hoagland. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9164.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9165.759999999998s)]
*  But what this is. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9166.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9168.199999999999s)]
*  But what it really is is just shadows on a piece of rock. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9168.64s)]
*  For sure. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9174.96s)]
*  It's just in one image though. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9175.56s)]
*  I feel like this was one of the very early explorations of Mars. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9178.56s)]
*  Sidonia Viking one. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9186.6s)]
*  So in Sidonia they would there was this guy though that was see that guy's still alive. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9188.6s)]
*  Hoagland. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9195.32s)]
*  I think his name is Richard Hoagland but he would like milk this for all it's worth and he made a series of videos talking about the [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9196.32s)]
*  geometry that you could find in Sidonia is impossible to create in nature. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9205.0s)]
*  And this only means that there has to have been an advanced civilization that existed on Mars and the government's hiding this from us. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9211.32s)]
*  It was one of those things and of course seemed at least a little out of his fucking mind. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9218.119999999999s)]
*  But when you smoke a lot of pot and watch documentaries those those are ones that'll get you. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9223.32s)]
*  And his his one got me a couple of times I was like is this guy right. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9228.4s)]
*  Because like I'm one of those people like I was convinced that the original Bigfoot footage diversity the pattern Patterson Bigfoot footage. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9232.199999999999s)]
*  No it's so fake. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9243.039999999999s)]
*  We'll show you that in a minute. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9245.439999999999s)]
*  It's so fake. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9246.199999999999s)]
*  But I remember one time being barbecued looking at that thinking it was real. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9247.08s)]
*  So maybe it's real. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9250.56s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9251.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe I'm an asshole. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9252.039999999999s)]
*  Maybe I've been mocking Bigfoot this whole time but it's real. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9253.08s)]
*  It's coming after you next. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9255.4s)]
*  You know that. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9256.919999999998s)]
*  Oh what. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9257.679999999998s)]
*  Stabilizes this is people have worked on it. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9259.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9261.16s)]
*  So you know that they stabilize the image because the real image the guy was on a horse. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9261.439999999999s)]
*  And by the way the guy was a con man. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9266.88s)]
*  All these kooks that want to believe this. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9271.199999999999s)]
*  There's a whole series of things that go to it. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9274.16s)]
*  First of all there's the guy who took this footage was arrested for fraud for not paying for the very camera that he used to film this footage. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9275.72s)]
*  Then there was there's a guy who looks just like silly. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9288.24s)]
*  You could see the thing that's the state looks over it. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9295.439999999999s)]
*  It's creepy. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9298.76s)]
*  The real version of it. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9299.6s)]
*  That's the dude though. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9301.08s)]
*  What is the dude's name. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9302.119999999999s)]
*  Bob Heronimus. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9303.96s)]
*  Yeah Bob Heronimus. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9304.72s)]
*  Bob Heronimus is this guy who claims that it was him in the suit and that's him walks like Bigfoot and he's a big giant dude too big cowboy. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9306.0s)]
*  And not only that there was a very there was an actual gorilla suit that this guy Patterson had bought. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9314.199999999999s)]
*  Like there was a person who sold him a gorilla suit and then there's another name guy named Gimlin Bob Gimlin I believe. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9320.88s)]
*  Gimlet or Gimlin who was also involved in this who also said that it was a hoax. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9328.68s)]
*  So saving that footage. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9334.0s)]
*  It's horseshit. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9335.439999999999s)]
*  But if you believe enough if you get loony and one time I got loony for like five minutes I thought it was real. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9336.56s)]
*  I was like I think it might be real. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9343.12s)]
*  We've taken a lot of pictures and again like we said I don't think we're really on that wave of like believing that I'm going to just video the corner and there's going to be someone there. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9344.960000000001s)]
*  There's one time that we ever got something that was convincing of us being like maybe this is something when our first time at the conjuring house if you just type in like Sam and Colby conjuring thermal photo. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9354.48s)]
*  Coolest thing we've ever captured. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9366.2s)]
*  Hands down. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9368.08s)]
*  For pictures. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9368.800000000001s)]
*  For pictures. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9369.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9370.04s)]
*  So like our buddy was pointing down like a thermal camera and you can take a picture of it and through this like gap she sees like you know there's a window at the end of the hall. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9370.76s)]
*  She sees like a face. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9382.560000000001s)]
*  And she's like what the boom. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9383.92s)]
*  She was a medium by the way. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9385.04s)]
*  Yeah she sees a face herself but then she's like no I see something on the camera to click the photo and then she shows us this picture. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9386.560000000001s)]
*  And to us. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9394.640000000001s)]
*  Okay so the left side of the screen doesn't like that's not part of it. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9396.36s)]
*  That's like a different. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9399.24s)]
*  Yeah it's only on the right. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9399.880000000001s)]
*  But like that right side is apparently like what we think is like a child's face with you can see a hair swoop eyes nose two eyes mouths. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9401.12s)]
*  It's like our hair. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9410.960000000001s)]
*  The corner of your shoulder right there as well. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9411.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9414.6s)]
*  Or it could be a squash. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9414.92s)]
*  Or it could be a deer heart. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9418.16s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9420.720000000001s)]
*  Could be a lot of things. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9420.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9421.880000000001s)]
*  Could be a lot of things. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9422.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9423.160000000002s)]
*  A thermal resonance though of some sort. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9423.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9426.240000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9426.480000000001s)]
*  It was in a window and we were inside so don't like ignore the thing on the left. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9426.76s)]
*  We were inside pointing out a window. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9430.320000000002s)]
*  You were inside pointing out a window and this is something. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9431.160000000002s)]
*  On the second floor too so it's not someone that's just a kid looking in. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9434.36s)]
*  I thought ghosts are supposed to be cold. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9437.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah I don't know. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9439.84s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9440.92s)]
*  I don't know actually. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9441.52s)]
*  Wouldn't you imagine that ghosts are cold like if you're in a room you're like oh something cold just walked past me. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9442.320000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9447.080000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9447.640000000001s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9448.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9449.04s)]
*  Can you go either way. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9449.88s)]
*  Like is a pocket of energy always going to be cold or. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9450.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9453.24s)]
*  Maybe it's a demon. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9453.56s)]
*  Maybe it's not. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9454.36s)]
*  Maybe that's a lot. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9455.48s)]
*  Coming from hell right. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9456.76s)]
*  That would make sense. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9458.119999999999s)]
*  How long do you guys think you could do this. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9460.44s)]
*  Do you think you just keep going to all these little haunted spots all over the world and keep doing this. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9463.64s)]
*  Have you thought about it. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9468.8s)]
*  I mean that's the thing is we've just scratched the surface. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9470.119999999999s)]
*  We've been doing this for four years but like we've been international twice to do haunted. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9472.6s)]
*  Only twice. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9477.92s)]
*  Imagine all the countries we haven't been to just to explore these places. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9478.84s)]
*  So we we could essentially like if we really wanted to do this for a very very long time. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9482.28s)]
*  But who knows we're taking it year by year. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9488.08s)]
*  Our plan right now like obviously we love the haunted stuff and there's endless amount of spots and there's always more interesting things we can do and experiments we can get into or more alone investigations. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9489.92s)]
*  Well also it's wildly successful. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9498.76s)]
*  I mean you guys have millions of followers on YouTube. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9500.880000000001s)]
*  Your videos are massive. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9504.320000000002s)]
*  So it's like you're it's obviously working. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9506.28s)]
*  So like you if you wanted to do something else it'd be really risky. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9509.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9512.64s)]
*  Well we also just want to kind of make our haunted empire as you could say like into like a bigger thing like we're we've been in talks of maybe creating our own haunted house in the future. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9513.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9523.84s)]
*  Haunted house or like side businesses like that. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9524.72s)]
*  We're getting into other parts of the mystery stuff. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9527.48s)]
*  So like we love you know we love the haunted but there's so many other avenues of mystery that are so easily talked about. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9529.6s)]
*  What other stuff are you guys interested in. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9536.92s)]
*  Like true crime like all these unsolved mysteries are so interesting. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9538.4s)]
*  We love the Velyska like shooting that video because Sam and I went like super hard with the research and we like fell in love with that process of telling the story. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9541.359999999999s)]
*  And so why not create like a story time true crime channel. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9549.72s)]
*  That's almost more fucked up to me because those are real stories that 100 percent people were killed by other people and just like oh you have to sit with that. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9552.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah it's definitely harsh that and conspiracy theories and all these other things. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9562.880000000001s)]
*  There's millions of things in this like mystery realm that aren't just haunted which is exciting to us as well as like you said other other business ventures and part of it. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9567.12s)]
*  But again most of this recently has been much more about other people's experiences rather than just ours. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9577.0s)]
*  So the majority of our content is taking other influencers or other other people like that maybe even sometimes they don't even believe and giving them experience that will like change the way they think. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9585.359999999999s)]
*  Like we started out with our friends like you said like our hometown friends and that was great and all. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9597.279999999999s)]
*  But now we love taking people that may not even believe or maybe be on the fence their interest in this stuff. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9601.76s)]
*  But then when they see these things like two or three times this last year we took someone that had never had an experience before and they come on an adventure with us and they see us like a full on shadow. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9607.68s)]
*  More than us and their lives are changed they're sitting there crying. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9618.28s)]
*  When she got scratched we went to the wash club which was kind of funny. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9622.52s)]
*  It was like literally what created Zach Bagans like in his ghost adventures and stuff. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9627.439999999999s)]
*  So we went to go investigate and we brought like a YouTube friend there and we were just like did you scratch yourself on the back and it was like in the dead center of her back almost to where it looked like it was bleeding to be honest. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9631.64s)]
*  And she started freaking out and of course it wasn't her. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9642.48s)]
*  And this is like a guest. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9645.32s)]
*  This is not us. Like if you don't viewers out there don't believe us because we do it all the time. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9646.519999999999s)]
*  It's like believe the guests that we have on at least. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9650.359999999999s)]
*  And this one guy we had on was like a complete skeptic. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9652.64s)]
*  He's like there's no way any of this is real. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9654.92s)]
*  Like three fourths through the night he's like come over here come over right now. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9657.64s)]
*  I'm seeing someone right in front of my eyes like I see a shadow figure and he's freaking out. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9661.16s)]
*  He's like I want to get out on a walk away. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9665.359999999999s)]
*  I do not want to be in this building anymore. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9667.199999999999s)]
*  This is freaking me out. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9668.48s)]
*  He's a nonbeliever. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9669.599999999999s)]
*  And those are those certain circumstances that we're like I see this is why we bring other people on here because it's like it's not just us saying this not this us like having this experience as anybody. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9670.759999999998s)]
*  That's what freaks me out. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9681.72s)]
*  I wonder how much you can mind fuck yourself and whether or not that's how you can see things like not saying that they're not real. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9683.039999999999s)]
*  But like if you can mind fuck yourself into a place of real fear. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9691.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9696.039999999999s)]
*  And that maybe that opens up doors. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9696.56s)]
*  For sure. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9698.96s)]
*  That's also more interesting when you want things to happen because at the end of the day like the reason why we do this is because if we were to prove on either way we'd rather prove that it's real because that [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9700.119999999999s)]
*  means there's something else out there. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9711.04s)]
*  Also it's way more fun. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9712.800000000001s)]
*  And it's fun. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9713.960000000001s)]
*  Like you know how many stories are you going to tell 3 a.m. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9714.84s)]
*  with your friends that you're like yeah this isn't real. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9717.68s)]
*  Let's go to sleep. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9719.560000000001s)]
*  Or if it is real like all these other things are so much interesting and so much more of a bonding experience with your friends when you do capture things and we are open to these things to happen. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9720.640000000001s)]
*  It turns out Ozzy got Parkinson's just because he's like a 71 year old dude who did a ton of coke. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9730.04s)]
*  It's not as fun as I'm sorry. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9734.92s)]
*  It's likely it's way more exciting. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9736.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9738.960000000001s)]
*  Doll got him. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9739.32s)]
*  It's way more exciting. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9744.119999999999s)]
*  Well listen gentlemen has been really fun talking to you. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9746.48s)]
*  I really enjoyed this. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9748.96s)]
*  Congratulations on all your success and don't get killed by any demons or ghosts. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9751.0s)]
*  Try not. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9755.119999999999s)]
*  If anything crazy happens let me know. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9756.68s)]
*  We'll come back and do it again. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9758.28s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HoFQdKD9Rk&t=9759.56s)]
