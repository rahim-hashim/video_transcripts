# Joe Rogan Experience #2044 - Sam Altman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=6.0s)]
*  Hello Sam, what's happening? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=13.0s)]
*  Not much, how are you? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=14.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming in here, appreciate it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=15.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=16.0s)]
*  So, what have you done? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=17.0s)]
*  Like ever? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=20.0s)]
*  No, I mean what have you done with AI? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=21.0s)]
*  I mean it's one of the things about this is, I mean, I think everyone is fascinated by it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=23.0s)]
*  I mean everyone is absolutely blown away at the current capability [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=32.0s)]
*  and wondering what the potential for the future is and whether or not that's a good thing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=37.0s)]
*  I think it's going to be a great thing, but I think it's not going to be all a great thing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=45.0s)]
*  And that is where I think that's where all of the complexity comes in for people. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=49.0s)]
*  It's not this like clean story of we're going to do this and it's all going to be great. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=56.0s)]
*  It's we're going to do this, it's going to be net great, but it's going to be like a technological revolution. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=60.0s)]
*  It's going to be a societal revolution. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=65.0s)]
*  And those always come with change. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=67.0s)]
*  And even if it's like net wonderful, you know, there's things we're going to lose along the way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=70.0s)]
*  Some kinds of jobs, some kind of parts of our way of life, some parts of the way we live are going to change or go away. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=75.0s)]
*  And no matter how tremendous the upside is there, and I believe it will be tremendously good, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=80.0s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of stuff we got to navigate through to make sure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=86.0s)]
*  That's a complicated thing for anyone to wrap their heads around. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=90.0s)]
*  And there's deep and super understandable emotions around that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=96.0s)]
*  That's a very honest answer that it's not all going to be good. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=99.0s)]
*  But it seems inevitable at this point. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=104.0s)]
*  It's yeah, I mean, it's definitely inevitable. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=108.0s)]
*  My my view of the world, you know, when you're like a kid in school, you learn about this technological revolution and then that one and then that one. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=110.0s)]
*  And my view of the world now sort of looking backwards and forwards is that this is like one long technological revolution. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=118.0s)]
*  And we had sure like first we had to figure out agriculture so that we had the resources and time to figure out how to build machines. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=125.0s)]
*  And then we had the industrial revolution. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=133.0s)]
*  And that made us learn about a lot of stuff, a lot of other scientific discovery to let us do the computer revolution. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=134.0s)]
*  And that's now letting us as we scale up to these massive systems do the revolution. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=140.0s)]
*  But it really is just one long story of humans discovering science and technology and co-evolving with it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=144.0s)]
*  And I think it's the most exciting story of all time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=151.0s)]
*  I think it's how we get to this world of abundance. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=154.0s)]
*  And although, you know, although we do have these things to navigate and there will be these downsides, if you think about what it means for the world and for people's quality of lives, if we can get to a world where the cost of intelligence and the abundance that comes with that, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=157.0s)]
*  the cost dramatically falls, the abundance goes way up, goes way up. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=178.0s)]
*  I think we'll do the same thing with energy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=180.0s)]
*  And I think those are the two sort of key inputs to everything else we want. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=182.0s)]
*  So if we can have abundant and cheap energy and intelligence, that will transform people's lives largely for the better. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=185.0s)]
*  And I think it's going to in the same way that if we could go back now 500 years and look at someone's life, we'd say, well, there's some great things, but they didn't have this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=191.0s)]
*  They didn't have that. Can you believe they didn't have modern medicine? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=200.0s)]
*  That's what people are going to look back at us like. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=202.0s)]
*  But in 50 years, when you think about the people that currently rely on jobs that A.I. will replace, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=205.0s)]
*  when you think about whether it's truck drivers or automation workers, people that work in the factory assembly lines, what, if anything, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=213.0s)]
*  what strategies can be put to mitigate the negative downsides of those jobs being eliminated by A.I.? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=223.0s)]
*  So I'll talk about some general thoughts, but I find making very specific predictions difficult because the way the technology goes has been so different than even my own intuitions or certainly my own intuitions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=231.0s)]
*  Maybe we should stop there and back up a little. What were your initial thoughts? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=248.0s)]
*  If you had asked me 10 years ago, I would have said first A.I. is going to come for blue collar labor. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=255.0s)]
*  Basically, it's going to drive trucks and do factory work and, you know, it'll handle heavy machinery. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=262.0s)]
*  Then maybe after that, it'll do like some kinds of cognitive labor kind of, you know, but not it won't be off doing what I think of personally as the really hard stuff. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=268.0s)]
*  It won't be off proving new mathematical theorems, won't be off, you know, discovering new science, won't be off writing code. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=279.0s)]
*  And then eventually, maybe, but maybe last of all, maybe never because human creativity is this magic special thing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=287.0s)]
*  Last of all, it'll come for the creative jobs. That's what I would have said. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=294.0s)]
*  Now, A. It looks to me like and for a while, A.I. is much better at doing tasks than doing jobs. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=299.0s)]
*  It can do these little pieces super well, but sometimes it goes off the rails. It can't keep like very long coherence. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=307.0s)]
*  So people are instead just able to do their existing jobs way more productively. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=313.0s)]
*  But you really still need the human there today. And then B. It's going exactly the other direction. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=319.0s)]
*  It could do the creative work first, stuff like coding second. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=323.0s)]
*  They can do things like other kinds of cognitive labor third. And we're the furthest away from like humanoid robots. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=327.0s)]
*  So back to the initial question. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=335.0s)]
*  If we do have something that completely eliminates factory workers, completely eliminates truck drivers, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=339.0s)]
*  delivery drivers, things along those lines, that creates this massive vacuum in our society. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=348.0s)]
*  So I think there's things that we're going to do that are good to do, but not sufficient. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=355.0s)]
*  So I think at some point we will do something like a UBI or some other kind of like very long term unemployment insurance, something. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=363.0s)]
*  But we'll have some way of giving people like redistributing money in society as a cushion for people, as people figure out the new jobs. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=371.0s)]
*  But and maybe I should touch on that. I'm not a believer at all that there won't be lots of new jobs. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=380.0s)]
*  I think human creativity, desire for status, wanting different ways to compete, invent new things, feel part of a community, feel valued. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=387.0s)]
*  That's not going to go anywhere. People have worried about that forever. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=396.0s)]
*  What happens is we get better tools and we just invent new things and more amazing things to do. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=400.0s)]
*  And there's a big universe out there. And I think I mean that like literally in that there's like space is really big. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=406.0s)]
*  But also there's just so much stuff we can all do if we do get to this world of abundant intelligence where you can sort of just think of a new idea and it gets created. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=413.0s)]
*  But. But again, that doesn't to the point we started with that that that doesn't provide like great solace to people who are losing their jobs today. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=423.0s)]
*  So saying there's going to be this great indefinite stuff in the future. People are like, what are we doing today? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=435.0s)]
*  So, you know, well, I think we will as a society do things like UBI and other ways of redistribution. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=440.0s)]
*  But I don't think that gets at the core of what people want. I think what people want is like agency, self-determination, the ability to play a role in architecting the future along with the rest of society, the ability to express themselves and create something meaningful to them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=448.0s)]
*  And. Also, I think a lot of people work jobs they hate, and I think there's we as a society are always a little bit confused about whether we want to work more or work less. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=466.0s)]
*  But but somehow. We all get to do something meaningful and we all get to play our role in driving the future forward. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=477.0s)]
*  That's really important. And what I hope is as those truck driving long haul truck driving jobs go away, which, you know, people have been wrong about predicting how fast that's going to happen, but it's going to happen. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=489.0s)]
*  We figure out not just a way to. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=500.0s)]
*  Solve the economic problem by like giving people the equivalent of money every month, but that there's a way that and we've got a lot of ideas about this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=505.0s)]
*  There's a way that we like share ownership and decision making over the future. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=515.0s)]
*  I think I say a lot about a GIs that. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=521.0s)]
*  Everyone everyone realizes we're going to have to share the benefits of that, but we also have to share like the decision making over it and access to the system itself. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=524.0s)]
*  Like I'd be more excited about a world where we say rather than give everybody on Earth like one eight billionth of the AGI money, which we should do that to. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=534.0s)]
*  We say you get like one eight billionth of a one eight billionth slice of the system. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=542.0s)]
*  You can sell it to somebody else. You can sell to a company. You can pull it with other people. You can use it for whatever creative pursuit you want. You can use it to figure out how to start some new business. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=549.0s)]
*  And with that, you get sort of like a voting right over how this is all going to be used. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=558.0s)]
*  And so the better the AGI gets, the more your little one eight billionth ownership is worth to you. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=565.0s)]
*  We were joking around the other day on the podcast where I was saying that what we need is an AI government. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=570.0s)]
*  We should have an AI president and have AI right things. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=578.0s)]
*  Just make all the decisions? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=581.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have something that's completely unbiased, absolutely rational, has the accumulated knowledge of the entire human history at its disposal, including all knowledge of psychology and psychological study, including UBI, because that comes with a host of pitfalls and issues that people have with it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=582.0s)]
*  So I'll say something there. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=604.0s)]
*  I think we're still very far away from a system that is capable enough and reliable enough that any of us would want that. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=606.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you something I love about that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=614.0s)]
*  Someday, let's say that thing gets built. The fact that it can go around and talk to every person on Earth, understand their exact preferences at a very deep level, how they think about this issue and that one and how they balance the tradeoffs and what they want, and then understand all of that and collectively optimize [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=617.0s)]
*  optimize for the collective preferences of humanity or citizens of the US. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=635.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=640.0s)]
*  As long as it's not co-opted, right? Our government currently is co-opted. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=641.0s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=647.0s)]
*  We know for sure that our government is heavily influenced by special interests. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=648.0s)]
*  If we could have an artificial intelligence government that has no influence, nothing has influence on it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=652.0s)]
*  What a fascinating idea. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=661.0s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=662.0s)]
*  And I think it might be the only way where you're going to get completely objective, the absolute most intelligent decision for virtually every problem, every dilemma that we face currently in society. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=663.0s)]
*  Would you truly be comfortable handing over like final decision making and say, all right, AI, you got it from there? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=679.0s)]
*  No, no, but I'm not comfortable doing that with anybody. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=684.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=688.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=689.0s)]
*  I was uncomfortable with the Patriot Act. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=690.0s)]
*  I'm uncomfortable with many decisions that are being made. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=692.0s)]
*  It's just there's so much obvious evidence that decisions that are being made are not being made in the best interest of the overall well of the people. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=696.0s)]
*  It's being made in the decisions of whatever gigantic corporations that have donated to and whatever the military industrial complex and pharmaceutical industrial complex. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=705.0s)]
*  And it's just the money. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=717.0s)]
*  That's really what we know today that money has a massive influence on our society and the choices that get made and the overall good or bad for the population. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=719.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have no disagreement at all that the current system is super broken, not working for people, super corrupt, corrupt and for sure, like unbelievably run by money. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=740.0s)]
*  And and I think there is a way to do a better job than that with AI to in some way. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=741.0s)]
*  But this might just be like a factor of sitting with the systems all day and watching all of the ways they fail. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=750.0s)]
*  We got a long way to go. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=756.0s)]
*  A long way to go, I'm sure. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=757.0s)]
*  But when you think of AGI, when you think of the possible future, like where it goes to, do you ever extrapolate? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=759.0s)]
*  Do you ever like sit and pause and say, well, if this if this becomes sentient and it has the ability to make better versions of itself, how long before we're literally dealing with a God? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=769.0s)]
*  So the way that I think about this is it used to be that like AGI was this very binary moment. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=781.0s)]
*  It was before and after. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=788.0s)]
*  And I think I'm totally wrong about that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=790.0s)]
*  And the right way to think about it is this continuum continuum of intelligence, this smooth exponential curve back all the way to that sort of smooth curve curve of technological revolution. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=792.0s)]
*  The the amount of compute power we can put into the system, the scientific ideas about how to make it more efficient and smarter to give it the ability to do reasoning, to think about how to improve itself. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=804.0s)]
*  That will all come. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=817.0s)]
*  But my model for a long time, I think if you look at the world of AGI thinkers, there's there's sort of two particularly around the safety issues you're talking about. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=820.0s)]
*  There's two axes that matter. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=830.0s)]
*  There's the short what called short timelines or long timelines, you know, to the first milestone of AGI, whatever that's going to be. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=832.0s)]
*  Is that going to happen in a few years, a few decades, maybe even longer? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=840.0s)]
*  Although at this point, I think most people are a few years or a few decades. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=844.0s)]
*  And then there's takeoff speed. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=847.0s)]
*  Once we get there from there to that point, you're talking about where it's capable of the rapid self improvement. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=848.0s)]
*  Is that a slower, a faster process? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=854.0s)]
*  The world that I think we're heading that we're in and also the world that I think is the most controllable and the safest is the short timelines and slow takeoff quadrant. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=857.0s)]
*  And I think we're going to have, you know, there were a lot of very smart people for a while were like the thing you were just talking about happens in a day or three days. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=870.0s)]
*  And I don't that doesn't seem likely to me, given the shape of the technology as we understand it now. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=880.0s)]
*  Now, even if that happens in a decade or three decades, it's still like the blink of an eye from a historical perspective. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=886.0s)]
*  And there are going to be some real challenges to getting that right. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=893.0s)]
*  And the decisions we make, the sort of safety systems and the checks that the world puts in place, how we think about global regulation or rules of the road from a safety perspective for those projects. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=899.0s)]
*  It's super important because you can imagine many things going horribly wrong. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=915.0s)]
*  But I've been I feel cheerful about the progress the world is making towards taking this seriously. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=919.0s)]
*  And, you know, it reminds me of what I've read about the conversations that the world had right around the development of nuclear weapons. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=927.0s)]
*  It seems to me that this is at least in terms of public consciousness. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=936.0s)]
*  This is emerged very rapidly where I don't think anyone was really aware. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=939.0s)]
*  People were aware of the concept of artificial intelligence, but they didn't think that it was going to be implemented so comprehensively so quickly. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=945.0s)]
*  So chat GPT is on what 4.5 now for four. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=956.0s)]
*  And with 4.5, there'll be some sort of an exponential increase in its abilities. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=961.0s)]
*  It'll be somewhat better each step from each half step like that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=966.0s)]
*  You you kind of humans have this ability to get used to any new technology so quickly. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=972.0s)]
*  The thing that I think was unusual about the launch of Chachi Bote 3.5 and then four was that people hadn't really been paying attention. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=978.0s)]
*  And that's part of the reason we deploy. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=987.0s)]
*  We think it's very important that people and institutions have time to gradually understand this react, co-design the society that we want with it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=989.0s)]
*  And if you just build a G.I. in secret in a lab and then drop it on the world all at once, I think that's a really bad idea. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=998.0s)]
*  So we we had been trying to talk to the world about this for a while. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1003.0s)]
*  People if you don't give people something they can feel and use in their lives, they don't quite take it seriously. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1008.0s)]
*  Obviously, everybody's busy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1014.0s)]
*  And so there was this big overhang from where the technology was to where public consciousness was. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1015.0s)]
*  Now that's caught up. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1020.0s)]
*  We've deployed. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1022.0s)]
*  I think people understand it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1023.0s)]
*  I don't expect the the jump from like four to whenever we finish 4.5, which be a while. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1025.0s)]
*  I don't expect that to be the crazy. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1031.0s)]
*  I think the crazy switch, the crazy adjustment that people have had to go through has mostly happened. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1035.0s)]
*  I think most people have gone from thinking that AGI was science fiction and very far off to something that is going to happen. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1040.0s)]
*  And that was like a one time reframe. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1047.0s)]
*  And now, you know, every year you get a new iPhone over the 15 years or whatever since the launch, they've gotten dramatically better. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1049.0s)]
*  But iPhone to iPhone, you're like, OK, it's a little better. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1056.0s)]
*  But now if you go hold up the first iPhone to the 15 or whatever, that's a big difference. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1059.0s)]
*  GPT 3.5 to AGI, that'll be a big difference. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1063.0s)]
*  But along the way, it'll just get incrementally better. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1067.0s)]
*  Do you think about the convergence of things like Neuralink? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1069.0s)]
*  And there's a few competing technologies where they're trying to implement some sort of some sort of a connection between the human biological system and technology. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1074.0s)]
*  Do you want one of those things in your head? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1088.0s)]
*  I don't until everybody does. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1091.0s)]
*  And, you know, I have a joke about it, but it's like the idea is like once it gets you have to kind of because everybody's going to have it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1094.0s)]
*  So one of the hard questions about the all of the related merge stuff is exactly what you just said. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1101.0s)]
*  Like as a society, are we going to let some people merge with AGI, not others? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1110.0s)]
*  And if we do, then and you choose not to, like, what does that mean for you? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1116.0s)]
*  Right. And will you be protected? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1123.0s)]
*  How you get that moment right? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1126.0s)]
*  You know, if we like imagine like all the way out to the sci fi future, there have been a lot of sci fi books written about how you get that moment right. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1128.0s)]
*  You know, who gets to do that first? What about people who don't want to? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1136.0s)]
*  How do you make sure that people that do it first, like actually help lift everybody up together? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1138.0s)]
*  Yeah. How do you make sure people who want to just like live their very human life get to do that? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1142.0s)]
*  That stuff is really hard and honestly so far off from my problems of the day that I don't get to think about that as much as I'd like to because I do think it's super interesting. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1147.0s)]
*  I, but yeah, it seems like if we just think logically, that's going to be a huge challenge at some point and people are going to want wildly divergent things. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1158.0s)]
*  But there is a societal question about how we're going to like the questions of fairness that come there and what it means for the people who don't do it super, super complicated. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1176.0s)]
*  Anyway, on the neural interface side, I'm in the short term, like before we figure out how to upload someone's conscience into a computer, if that's even possible at all, which I think there's plenty of sides you could take on why it's not. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1190.0s)]
*  The thing that I find myself most interested in is what we can do without drilling a hole in someone's head. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1205.0s)]
*  How much of the inner monologue can we read out with an externally mounted device? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1215.0s)]
*  And if we have a imperfect, low bandwidth, low accuracy neural interface, can people still just learn how to use it really well in a way that's like quite powerful for what they can now do with a new computing platform? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1219.0s)]
*  And my guess is we'll figure that out. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1234.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen that headpiece. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1236.0s)]
*  There's a demonstration where there's someone asking someone a question. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1238.0s)]
*  They have this headpiece on. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1242.0s)]
*  They think the question and then they literally Google the question and get the answers through their head. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1244.0s)]
*  That's the kind of thing we've been that's the kind of direction we've been exploring. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1248.0s)]
*  Yeah, that seems to me to be step one. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1251.0s)]
*  That's the pong of the eventual immersive 3D video games. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1255.0s)]
*  Like you're going to get these first steps and they're going to seem sort of crude and slow. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1260.0s)]
*  I mean, it's essentially slower than just asking Siri. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1265.0s)]
*  I think if someone built a system where you could think words doesn't have to be a question. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1268.0s)]
*  It could just be your passive rambling inner monologue, but certainly could be a question. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1276.0s)]
*  And that was being fed into GPT-5 or 6. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1280.0s)]
*  And in your field of vision, the words in response were being displayed. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1284.0s)]
*  That would be the pong. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1288.0s)]
*  That's still soup. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1290.0s)]
*  That's a very valuable tool to have. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1291.0s)]
*  And that seems like that's inevitable. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1293.0s)]
*  There's hard work to get there on the neural interface side, but I believe it will happen. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1300.0s)]
*  My concern is that the initial adopters of this will have such a massive advantage over the general population. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1302.0s)]
*  Well, that doesn't concern me because that's like a, you know, that's not you're not. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1308.0s)]
*  That's just like better. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1312.0s)]
*  That's a better computer. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1314.0s)]
*  You're not like jacking your brain into something in a high risk thing. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1316.0s)]
*  You know what you do when you don't want them when you take off the glasses. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1319.0s)]
*  So that feels fine. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1322.0s)]
*  Well, this is just the external device then. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1325.0s)]
*  Oh, I think we can do the kind of like read your thoughts with an external device at some point. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1328.0s)]
*  Read your internal monologue. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1333.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1335.0s)]
*  And do you think we'll be able to communicate with an external device as well telepathically? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1336.0s)]
*  Or semi telepathically through technology? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1341.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1344.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1345.0s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1346.0s)]
*  My real concern is that once we take the step to use an actual neural interface when there's an actual operation [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1348.0s)]
*  and they're using some sort of an implant and then that implant becomes more sophisticated. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1359.0s)]
*  It's not the iPhone 1. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1365.0s)]
*  Now it's the iPhone 15. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1366.0s)]
*  And as these things get better and better, we're on the road to cyborgs. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1368.0s)]
*  We're on the road to like why would you want to be a biological person? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1374.0s)]
*  Do you really want to live in a fucking log cabin when you can be in the Matrix? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1379.0s)]
*  I mean, it seems like we're not we're on this path. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1383.0s)]
*  We're already a little bit down that path, right? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1390.0s)]
*  Like if you take away someone's phone and they have to go function in the world today. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1393.0s)]
*  They're at a disadvantage relative to everybody else. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1397.0s)]
*  So that's like maybe that's like the lightest weight version of a merge we could imagine. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1400.0s)]
*  But I think it's worth like if we go back to that earlier thing about the one exponential curve, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1406.0s)]
*  I think it's worth saying we've like lifted off the x-axis already down this path, the tiniest bit. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1410.0s)]
*  And yeah, even if you don't go all the way to like a neural interface, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1416.0s)]
*  VR will get so good that some people just don't want to take it off that much. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1422.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1425.0s)]
*  And that's fine for them. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1426.0s)]
*  As long as we can solve this question of how do we like think about what a balance of power means in the world. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1431.0s)]
*  I think there will be many people. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1438.0s)]
*  I'm certainly one of them who's like actually the human body and the human experience is pretty great. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1440.0s)]
*  That log cabin in the woods, pretty awesome. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1445.0s)]
*  I don't want to be there all the time. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1447.0s)]
*  I'd love to go play the great video game. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1448.0s)]
*  But like I'm really happy to get to go there. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1450.0s)]
*  Right. Sometimes. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1453.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's still human experiences that are just like great human experience, just laughing with friends, you know, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1454.0s)]
*  kissing someone that you've never kissed before that you're on a first date. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1463.0s)]
*  Those kind of things are the real moments. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1467.0s)]
*  It just laughs. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1471.0s)]
*  Yeah. Having a glass of wine with a friend and just laughing. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1473.0s)]
*  Not quite the same in VR. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1476.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1477.0s)]
*  Now, when the VR goes super far, so you can't, you know, it's like you are jacked in on your brain and you can't tell what's real and what's not. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1478.0s)]
*  And then everybody gets like super deep on the simulation hypothesis or the like Eastern religion or whatever. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1486.0s)]
*  And I don't know what happens at that point. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1492.0s)]
*  Do you ever fuck around with simulation theory? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1494.0s)]
*  Because the real problem is when you combine that with probability theory and you talk to the people that say, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1496.0s)]
*  Well, if you just look at the numbers, the probability that we're already in a simulation is much higher than the probability that we're not. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1501.0s)]
*  It's never been clear to me what to do about it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1509.0s)]
*  It's like, OK, that intellectually makes a lot of sense. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1516.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think probably sure. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1520.0s)]
*  That seems convincing. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1522.0s)]
*  But now this is my reality. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1523.0s)]
*  This is my life. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1524.0s)]
*  And I'm going to live it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1525.0s)]
*  And I've, you know, from like 2 a.m. in my college freshman dorm hallway till now, I've made no more progress on it than that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1526.0s)]
*  Well, it seems like one of those. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1538.0s)]
*  It's there's no, you know, it's if it is a possibility, if it is real. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1543.0s)]
*  First of all, once it happens, what are you going to do? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1550.0s)]
*  I mean, that that is the new reality. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1553.0s)]
*  And in many ways, our new reality is as alien to, you know, hunter gatherers from 15000 years ago as that would be to us now. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1554.0s)]
*  I mean, we're already we've already entered into some very bizarre territory where, you know, I was just having a conversation with my kids. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1566.0s)]
*  We're asking questions about something. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1574.0s)]
*  And, you know, I always say, let's guess what percentage of that is this? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1576.0s)]
*  And then we just Google it and then just ask Siri and we pull it up. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1582.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1585.0s)]
*  Like that alone is so bizarre compared to how it was when I was 13. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1586.0s)]
*  And you had to go to the library and hope that the book was accurate. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1592.0s)]
*  Totally. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1596.0s)]
*  I was very annoyed. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1597.0s)]
*  This I was reading about how horrible systems like Chachi Bt and Google are from an environmental impact because it's, you know, using like some extremely tiny amount of energy for each query. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1599.0s)]
*  And, you know, how we're all destroying the world. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1610.0s)]
*  And I was like, before that, people drove to the library. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1612.0s)]
*  Let's talk about how much carbon they burn. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1615.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1616.0s)]
*  This question versus what it takes now. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1617.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1618.0s)]
*  Those. But that's just people looking for some reason why something's bad. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1619.0s)]
*  That's not a logical perspective. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1623.0s)]
*  Well, we should be looking at is the spectacular changes that are possible through this and all the problems, the insurmountable problems that we have with resources, with the environment, with cleaning up the ocean. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1625.0s)]
*  Climate change. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1638.0s)]
*  There's so many problems that we need this to solve all of everything else. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1639.0s)]
*  And that's why we need President A.I. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1643.0s)]
*  If if A.I. could make every scientific discovery, but we still had human presidents, you think would be OK? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1647.0s)]
*  No, because those creeps would still be pocketing money and they'd have offshore accounts. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1653.0s)]
*  And it would always be a weird thing of corruption and how to mitigate that corruption, which is also one of the fascinating things about the climate change. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1659.0s)]
*  One of the fascinating things about the current state of technology is that we're so much more aware of corruption. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1667.0s)]
*  We're so much more. There's so much independent reporting and we're so much more cognizant of the actual problems that are in place. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1672.0s)]
*  This is really great. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1681.0s)]
*  One of the things one of the things that I've observed, obviously many other people, too, is corruption is such an incredible hindrance to getting anything done in a society to make it forward progress. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1683.0s)]
*  And, you know, my worldview had been more U.S. centric when I was younger. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1694.0s)]
*  And as I've just studied the world more and had to work in more places in the world, like it's amazing how much corruption there still is. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1699.0s)]
*  But the shift to a technologically enabled world, I think, is a major force against it because everything is it's harder to hide stuff. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1707.0s)]
*  And I do think corruption in the world will keep trending down. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1716.0s)]
*  Because of its exposure through technology. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1721.0s)]
*  Yeah. It comes at a cost. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1725.0s)]
*  And I think the loss that like I am very worried about how far the surveillance state could go here. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1728.0s)]
*  But in a world where payments, for example, are no longer like bags of cash, but done somehow digitally, and somebody, even if you're using Bitcoin, can like watch those flows. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1734.0s)]
*  I think that's like a corruption reducing thing. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1749.0s)]
*  I agree. But I'm very worried about central bank digital currency and that being tied to a social credit score. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1752.0s)]
*  Super against. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1760.0s)]
*  Yeah, that scares the shit out of me. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1762.0s)]
*  And that the push to that is not that's not for the overall good of society. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1764.0s)]
*  That's for control. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1769.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think like. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1770.0s)]
*  I mean, there's many things that I'm disappointed that the U.S. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1772.0s)]
*  government has done recently, but the war on crypto, which I think is a like, we can't give this up like we're going to control this and all that. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1777.0s)]
*  That's like. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1786.0s)]
*  That's the thing that like makes me quite sad about the country. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1787.0s)]
*  It makes me quite sad about the country, too. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1791.0s)]
*  But then you also see with things like FTX like, oh, this can get without regulation and without someone overseeing it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1793.0s)]
*  This can get really fucked. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1801.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not anti regulation. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1805.0s)]
*  Like, I think there's clearly a role for it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1807.0s)]
*  And I also think FTX was like a sort of comically bad situation. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1810.0s)]
*  Yeah, we shouldn't. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1818.0s)]
*  It's like worst case scenario. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1819.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1820.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's a fun one. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1821.0s)]
*  Like, it's totally fun. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1822.0s)]
*  And I love that story. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1823.0s)]
*  I mean, you clearly. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1825.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1828.0s)]
*  I love the fact that they were all doing drugs and sex with each other. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1829.0s)]
*  No, no, I had every part of the drama. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1832.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a gripping story because they had everything there. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1834.0s)]
*  They did their taxes with like what was the program that they used? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1838.0s)]
*  QuickBooks. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1843.0s)]
*  QuickBooks. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1844.0s)]
*  They're dealing with billions of dollars. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1846.0s)]
*  I don't know why I think the word polycule is so funny. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1848.0s)]
*  Polycule? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1851.0s)]
*  That was what they like when you call a relationship like a poly but closed polyamorous molecule put together. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1852.0s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1859.0s)]
*  So they were like, this is our polycule. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1860.0s)]
*  So there's nine of them and they're poly amongst them. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1862.0s)]
*  Or ten of them or whatever. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1863.0s)]
*  Yeah, you call that a polycule. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1864.0s)]
*  And I thought that was the funny, like that became like a meme in Silicon Valley for a while that I thought was hilarious. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1865.0s)]
*  You clearly want enough regulation that that can't happen. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1871.0s)]
*  But they're like. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1875.0s)]
*  Well, I'm not against that happening. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1878.0s)]
*  I'm against them doing what they did with the money. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1879.0s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1882.0s)]
*  The polycule is kind of fun. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1883.0s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1884.0s)]
*  No, no. I mean, you want enough thing that like FTX can't lose all of its depositors money. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1885.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1889.0s)]
*  But I think there's an important point here, which is you have all of this other regulation that people and it didn't keep us safe. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1890.0s)]
*  And the basic thing, which was like, you know, let's do that. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1897.0s)]
*  That was not all of the crypto stuff people were talking about. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1902.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1906.0s)]
*  I mean, the real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin to me. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1907.0s)]
*  I mean, that's the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1911.0s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's limited in the amount that there can be. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1920.0s)]
*  It's, you know, people mine it with their own. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1925.0s)]
*  It's like that to me is very fascinating. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1929.0s)]
*  And I love the fact that it's been implemented. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1931.0s)]
*  And that at least something like I've had Andreas Antonopoulos on the podcast and he's when he talks about it, he's living it. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1934.0s)]
*  He's spending all of his money. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1944.0s)]
*  Everything he has paid is in Bitcoin. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1946.0s)]
*  He pays his rent in Bitcoin. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1948.0s)]
*  Everything he does is in Bitcoin. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1950.0s)]
*  I helped start a project called WorldCoin a few years ago. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1951.0s)]
*  That's and so I've gotten to like learn more about the space. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1955.0s)]
*  I'm excited about it for the same reasons. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1961.0s)]
*  I'm excited about Bitcoin too. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1963.0s)]
*  But I think this idea that we have a global currency that is outside of the control of any government is a super logical and important step on the tech tree. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1965.0s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1978.0s)]
*  Why should the government control currency? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1979.0s)]
*  I mean, the government should be dealing with all the pressing environmental, social infrastructure issues, foreign policy issues, economic issues. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1981.0s)]
*  The things that we need to be governed in order to have a peaceful and prosperous society that's equal and equitable. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1990.0s)]
*  What do you think happens to money and currency after AGI? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=1999.0s)]
*  I've wondered about that because I feel like with money, especially when money goes digital, the bottleneck is access. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2003.0s)]
*  If we get to a point where all information is just freely shared everywhere, there are no secrets, there are no boundaries, there are no borders. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2012.0s)]
*  We're reading minds. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2023.0s)]
*  We have complete access to all of the information of everything you've ever done, everything everyone's ever said. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2025.0s)]
*  There's no hidden secrets. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2033.0s)]
*  What is money then? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2035.0s)]
*  Money is this digital thing. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2036.0s)]
*  Well, how can you possess it? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2038.0s)]
*  How can you possess this digital thing if there is literally no bottleneck? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2040.0s)]
*  There's no barriers to anyone accessing any information because essentially it's just ones and zeros. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2045.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2052.0s)]
*  I mean, another way I think the information frame makes sense. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2053.0s)]
*  Another way is that money is like a sort of way to trade labor or trade a limited number of hard assets like land and houses and whatever. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2055.0s)]
*  And if you think about a world where intellectual labor is just readily available and super cheap, then that's somehow very different. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2067.0s)]
*  I think there will always be goods that we want to be scarce and expensive, but it'll only be those goods that we want to be scarce and expensive and services that still are. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2081.0s)]
*  And so money in a world like that, I think, is just a very curious idea. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2090.0s)]
*  Yeah, it becomes a different thing. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2095.0s)]
*  I mean, it's not a bag of gold in a leather pouch that you're carrying around. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2097.0s)]
*  Not going to do you much good, probably. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2101.0s)]
*  It's not going to do you much good. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2103.0s)]
*  But then the question becomes how is that money distributed and how do we avoid some horrible Marxist society where there's one totalitarian government that's just... [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2104.0s)]
*  Just doles it out. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2115.0s)]
*  That would be bad. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2116.0s)]
*  I think you've got to... [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2117.0s)]
*  My current best idea, and maybe there's something better, is I think you... [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2119.0s)]
*  If we are right... [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2123.0s)]
*  A lot of reasons we could be wrong, but if we are right that the AGI systems, of which there will be a few, become the high order bits of sort of influence whatever in the world, I think you do need not to just redistribute the money, but the access so that people can make their own decisions about how to use it and how to govern it. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2125.0s)]
*  And if you've got one idea, you get to do this. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2146.0s)]
*  If I've got one idea, I get to do that. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2148.0s)]
*  And I have rights to basically do whatever I want with my part of it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2151.0s)]
*  And if I come up with better ideas than you, I get rewarded for that by whatever the society is or vice versa. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2160.0s)]
*  You know, the hardliners, the people that are against welfare and against any sort of universal basic income, UBI, what they're really concerned with is human nature. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2161.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2175.0s)]
*  They believe that if you remove incentives, if you just give people free money, they become addicted to it, they become lazy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2176.0s)]
*  But isn't that a human biological and psychological bottleneck? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2183.0s)]
*  And perhaps with the implementation of artificial intelligence combined with some sort of neural interface, whether it's external or internal, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2188.0s)]
*  it seems like that's a problem that can be solved, that you can essentially, and this is where it gets really spooky. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2203.0s)]
*  You can re-engineer the human biological system and you can remove all of these problems that people have that are essentially problems that date back to human reward systems when we were tribal people, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2213.0s)]
*  hunter gatherer people, whether it's jealousy, lust, envy, all these variables that come into play when you're dealing with money and status and social status. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2226.0s)]
*  If those are eliminated with technology and essentially we become a next version of what the human species is possible. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2238.0s)]
*  Look, we're very, very far removed from tribal, brutal societies of cave people. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2248.0s)]
*  We all agree that this is a way better way to live. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2257.0s)]
*  It's way safer. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2260.0s)]
*  I was talking about this at my comedy club last night because my wife was talking about DNA and my wife was saying that, look, everybody came from cave people, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2264.0s)]
*  which is kind of a fucked up thought, that everyone here is here because of cave people. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2275.0s)]
*  Well, all that's still in our DNA. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2279.0s)]
*  All that's still, and these reward systems can be hijacked and they can be hijacked by just giving people money and like, you don't have to work, you don't have to do anything, you don't have to have ambition, you'll just have money and just lay around and do drugs. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2282.0s)]
*  That's the fear that people have of giving people free money. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2296.0s)]
*  But if we can figure out how to literally engineer the human biological vehicle and remove all those pitfalls, if we can enlighten people technologically, maybe enlighten is the wrong word, but advance the human species to the point where those are no longer dilemmas because those are easily solvable through code. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2301.0s)]
*  They're easily solvable through enhancing the human biological system, perhaps raising dopamine levels to the point where anger and fear and hate are impossible. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2331.0s)]
*  They don't exist. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2343.0s)]
*  And if you just had everyone on Molly, how many wars would there be? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2345.0s)]
*  There'd be zero wars. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2350.0s)]
*  I mean, I think if you could get everyone on Earth to all do Molly once on the same day, that'd be a tremendous thing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2351.0s)]
*  It would be. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2357.0s)]
*  If you got everybody on Earth to do Molly every day, that'd be a real loss. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2358.0s)]
*  But what if they did a low dose of Molly where you just get to, ah, where everybody greets people with love and affection and there's no longer a concern about competition. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2361.0s)]
*  Instead, the concern is about the fascination of innovation and creation and creativity. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2374.0s)]
*  Man, we could talk the rest of the time about this one topic. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2382.0s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2385.0s)]
*  I think if I could like push a button to like remove all human striving and conflict, I wouldn't do it, first of all. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2386.0s)]
*  Like, I think that's a very important part of our story and experience. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2399.0s)]
*  And also, I think we can see both from our own biological history and also from what we know about AI that very simple goal systems, fitness functions, reward models, whatever you want to call it, lead to incredibly impressive results. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2404.0s)]
*  You know, if the biological imperative is survive and reproduce, look how far that has somehow gotten us as a society. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2426.0s)]
*  All of this, all this stuff we have, all this technology, this building, whatever else like that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2434.0s)]
*  That got here through an extremely simple goal in a very complex environment leading to all of the richness and complexity of people fulfilling this biological imperative to some degree and wanting to impress each other. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2443.0s)]
*  So I think like evolutionary fitness is a simple and unbelievably powerful idea. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2463.0s)]
*  So could you carefully edit out every individual manifestation of that? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2468.0s)]
*  Maybe, but I don't want to like live in a society of drones where everybody is just sort of like on Mali all the time either. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2477.0s)]
*  That doesn't seem like the right answer. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2485.0s)]
*  Like I want us to continue to strive. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2489.0s)]
*  I want us to continue to push back the frontier and go out and explore. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2490.0s)]
*  And I actually think something's already gotten a little off track in society about all of that. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2495.0s)]
*  And we're, I don't know, I think like I'm, I don't, I thought I'd be older by the time I felt like the old guy complaining about the youth. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2502.0s)]
*  But I think we've lost something. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2513.0s)]
*  And I think that we need more striving, maybe more risk taking, more like explorer spirit. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2517.0s)]
*  What do you mean by you think we've lost something? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2528.0s)]
*  I mean, here's like a version of it very much from my own lens. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2538.0s)]
*  I was a startup investor for a long time. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2543.0s)]
*  And it often was the case that the very best startup founders were in their early or mid 20s or late 20s, maybe even. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2546.0s)]
*  And now they skew much older. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2556.0s)]
*  And what I want to know is in the world today, where are the super great 25 year old founders? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2558.0s)]
*  And there are a few. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2564.0s)]
*  There are a few. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2565.0s)]
*  It's not fair to say there are none, but there are less than there were before. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2566.0s)]
*  And I think that's bad for society at all levels. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2569.0s)]
*  I mean, like tech company founders is one example, but like people who go off and create something new, who push on a disagreeable or controversial idea, we need that to drive forward. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2576.0s)]
*  We need that sort of spirit. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2589.0s)]
*  We need people to be able to put out ideas and be wrong and not be ostracized from society for it or not have it be like something that they get canceled for or whatever. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2592.0s)]
*  We need people to be able to take a risk in their career because they believe in some important scientific quest that may not work out or may sound like really controversial or bad or whatever. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2603.0s)]
*  Certainly when we started OpenAI and we were saying we think this AGI thing is real and could be, you know, could be done unlikely, but so important if it happens. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2614.0s)]
*  And all of the older scientists in our field were saying those people are irresponsible. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2624.0s)]
*  You shouldn't talk about AGI. That's like, you know, they're like selling a scam or they're like, you know, they're kind of being reckless and it's going to lead to an AGI winter. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2629.0s)]
*  We said we believed we said at the time we knew it was unlikely, but it was an important quest and we were going to go after it and kind of like fuck the haters. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2640.0s)]
*  That's important to a society. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2648.0s)]
*  What do you think is the origin? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2652.0s)]
*  Like what? Why do you think there are less young people that are doing those kind of things now as opposed to a decade or two ago? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2654.0s)]
*  I am so interested in that topic. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2665.0s)]
*  I'm tempted to blame the education system, but I sure that I think that like interacts with society. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2669.0s)]
*  In all of these strange ways. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2677.0s)]
*  It's funny. There was this like thing all over my Twitter feed recently trying to talk about like what you know what like what caused the drop in testosterone in American men over the last few decades. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2680.0s)]
*  And no one was like this is a symptom, not a cause. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2691.0s)]
*  And everyone was like, oh, it's the microplastics. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2695.0s)]
*  It's the birth control pills. It's the whatever it's the whatever it's the whatever. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2698.0s)]
*  And I think this is like not at all the most important piece of this topic, but it was just interesting to me sociologically that there was there was only talk about it being about what caused it, not about it being an effect of some sort of change in society. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2701.0s)]
*  But isn't what caused it? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2723.0s)]
*  Well, there's biological reasons why like when we talk about the phthalates and microplastic pesticides, environmental factors. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2727.0s)]
*  Those are real. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2736.0s)]
*  Totally. And I don't like again. I'm so far out of my depth and expertise here. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2738.0s)]
*  This was it was just interesting to me that the only talk was about like biological factors that somehow society can have some sort of effect. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2741.0s)]
*  Well, society most certainly has an effect. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2750.0s)]
*  Do you know what the answer to this is? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2752.0s)]
*  I don't. I mean, I've had a podcast with Dr. Shanna Swan, who wrote the book Countdown. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2754.0s)]
*  And that is all about the introduction of petrochemical products and the correlating drop in testosterone rise in miscarriages. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2760.0s)]
*  The fact that these are ubiquitous endocrine disruptors that when they do blood tests on people, they find some insane number. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2770.0s)]
*  It's like 90 plus percent of people have phthalates in your system. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2779.0s)]
*  And you appreciate the metal cups. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2783.0s)]
*  Yeah, we try to mitigate it as much as possible. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2785.0s)]
*  But I mean, you're getting it if you're microwaving food, you're you're fucking getting it. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2789.0s)]
*  You get you just getting it. You get if you process food, you're getting it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2793.0s)]
*  You're getting a certain amount of microplastics in your diet. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2796.0s)]
*  And estimates have been that it's as high as a credit card of microplastics. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2798.0s)]
*  Flood iron in your body. You consume a credit card of that a week. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2804.0s)]
*  Well, the real concern is with mammals, because the introductions when they've done studies with mammals and they've introduced phthalates into their body, there's a correlating. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2808.0s)]
*  One thing that happens is the these animals, their taints shrink like the taint of the mammal. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2821.0s)]
*  When you look at males, it's 50 percent to 100 percent larger than the females. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2828.0s)]
*  With the introduction of phthalates on the males, the taints start shrinking, the penises shrink, the testicles shrinks, sperm count shrinks. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2833.0s)]
*  So we know there's a direct biological connection between the this these chemicals and how they interact with with bodies. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2840.0s)]
*  So that's that's a real one. And it's also. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2851.0s)]
*  The amount of petrochemical products that we have, the amount of plastics that we use, it's it is such an integral part of our culture and our society, our civilization. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2854.0s)]
*  It's everywhere. And I've wondered if you think about how these territorial apes evolve into this new, advanced species, wouldn't one of the very best ways be to get rid of one of the things that causes the most problems, which is testosterone? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2866.0s)]
*  We need testosterone. We need aggressive men and protectors. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2892.0s)]
*  But why do we need them? We need them because there's other aggressive men that are evil. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2896.0s)]
*  Right. So we need protectors from ourselves. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2901.0s)]
*  We need the good, strong people to protect us from the bad, strong people. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2905.0s)]
*  But if we're in the process of integrating with technology, if technology is an inescapable part of our life, if it is everywhere, you're using it. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2910.0s)]
*  You have the Internet of everything that's in your microwave and your television, your computers, everything you use. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2920.0s)]
*  As time goes on, that will be more and more a part of your life. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2927.0s)]
*  And as these plastics are introduced into the human biological system, you're seeing a feminization of the males of the species. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2932.0s)]
*  You're seeing a downfall in birth rate. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2941.0s)]
*  You're seeing all these correlating factors that would sort of lead us to become this more peaceful, less violent, less aggressive, less ego driven thing. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2944.0s)]
*  Which the world is definitely becoming over time. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2959.0s)]
*  And I'm all for less violence, obviously. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2964.0s)]
*  But I don't. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2968.0s)]
*  Look, obviously, testosterone has many great things to say for it and some bad tendencies, too. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2974.0s)]
*  But I don't think a world, if we leave that out of the equation and just say like a world that has a spirit that, you know, we're going to defend ourselves, we're going to ex. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2981.0s)]
*  We're going to find a way to like protect ourselves and our tribe and our society into this future, which you can get with lots of other ways. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=2996.0s)]
*  I think that's an important impulse. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3007.0s)]
*  More than that, though, what I meant is about if we go back to the issue of like where are the young founders? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3010.0s)]
*  Why don't we have why don't we have more of those? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3020.0s)]
*  And I don't think it's just the tech startup industry. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3023.0s)]
*  I think you could say that about like young scientists or many other categories. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3025.0s)]
*  Those are maybe just the ones that I know the best. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3029.0s)]
*  In a world with any amount of technology, I still think we we've got it. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3034.0s)]
*  It is our destiny in some sense to stay on this on this curve. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3044.0s)]
*  And we still need to go figure out what's next and after the next hill and after the next hill. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3048.0s)]
*  And it would be. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3053.0s)]
*  My perception is that there is some long term societal change happening here, and I think it makes us less happy to. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3058.0s)]
*  Right. It may make us less happy. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3066.0s)]
*  But what I'm saying is if the human species does integrate with technology, wouldn't a great way to facilitate that to be to kind of feminize the primal apes? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3070.0s)]
*  And to sort of downplay the role, you mean like the tech like should the AGI? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3082.0s)]
*  Well, maybe. I don't know if it's a GI. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3087.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's just an inevitable, inevitable consequence of technology, because especially the type of technology that we use, which does have so much plastic in it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3090.0s)]
*  And then on top of that, the technology that's involved in food systems, preservatives, all these different things that we use to make sure that people don't starve to death. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3100.0s)]
*  We've made incredible strides in that. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3108.0s)]
*  There are very few people in this country that starve to death. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3110.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is not. It's not a primary issue, but violence is a primary issue. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3113.0s)]
*  But our our concerns about violence are in our concerns about testosterone and strong men and powerful people is only because we need to protect against protect against other same thing. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3119.0s)]
*  Is that really the only reason? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3134.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3136.0s)]
*  I mean, how many like incredibly violent women are out there running gangs? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3138.0s)]
*  No, no, that part for sure. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3143.0s)]
*  Clearly not very many. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3144.0s)]
*  What I meant more is, is that the only reason that society values like strong masculinity? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3146.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3152.0s)]
*  I think it's a biological imperative, right? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3153.0s)]
*  And I think that biological imperative is because we used to have to defend against incoming tribes and predators and animals. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3155.0s)]
*  And and we we needed someone who was stronger than most to defend the rest. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3162.0s)]
*  And like that's the concept of the military. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3168.0s)]
*  That's why Navy SEAL training is so difficult. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3171.0s)]
*  We want the strongest of the strong to be at the tip of the spear. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3173.0s)]
*  But that's only because there's people like that out there that are bad. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3177.0s)]
*  If general artificial general intelligence and the implementation of some sort of a device that changes the biological structure of human beings to the point where that is no longer a concern. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3182.0s)]
*  Like if you are me and I am you and I know this because of technology, violence is impossible. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3200.0s)]
*  Look, by the time if this goes all the way down the sci fi path and we're all like merged into this one single like planetary universal whatever consciousness, then then then yes, you don't. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3201.0s)]
*  You don't need testosterone. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3211.0s)]
*  Need testosterone. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3212.0s)]
*  But especially if we can reproduce through other methods. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3214.0s)]
*  Like this is the alien hypothesis, right? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3218.0s)]
*  Like why do they look so spindly and without any gender? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3220.0s)]
*  And you know, when they have these big heads and they don't have physical strength, they don't need physical strength. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3223.0s)]
*  They have some sort of a telepathic way of communicating. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3227.0s)]
*  They probably don't need sounds with their mouths and they don't need this urge that we have to conquer and to spread our DNA. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3231.0s)]
*  Like that's so much of what people do is these reward systems that were established when we were territorial apes. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3240.0s)]
*  There's a question to me about how much you can ever get rid of rid of that if you make an AGI and it decides actually we don't need to expand. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3247.0s)]
*  We don't need more territory. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3261.0s)]
*  We're just like happy. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3262.0s)]
*  We at this point you me it the whole thing altogether all merged in or happy here on Earth. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3264.0s)]
*  We don't need to get any bigger. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3269.0s)]
*  We don't reproduce. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3270.0s)]
*  We don't need to grow. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3271.0s)]
*  We're just going to sit here and run. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3272.0s)]
*  A that sounds like a boring life. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3275.0s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3277.0s)]
*  I don't agree that that would be the logical conclusion. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3278.0s)]
*  I think the logical conclusion would be they would look for problems and frontiers that are insurmountable to our current existence like intergalactic communication and transportation. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3281.0s)]
*  What happens when it meets another AGI the other galaxy over? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3296.0s)]
*  What happens when it meets an AGI that's a million years more advanced? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3299.0s)]
*  Or that like what does that look like? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3303.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I've often wondered if we are. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3305.0s)]
*  I call ourselves the biological caterpillars that create the electronic butterfly that we're making a cocoon right now. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3309.0s)]
*  We don't even know what we're doing. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3315.0s)]
*  And I think it's also tied into consumerism because what does consumerism do? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3317.0s)]
*  Consumerism facilitates the creation of newer and better things because you always want the newest latest greatest. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3322.0s)]
*  So you have more advanced technology and automobiles and computers and cell phones and all of these different things, including medical science. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3328.0s)]
*  That's all for short. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3340.0s)]
*  True. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3342.0s)]
*  The thing I was like reflecting on as you were saying that is I don't think I. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3344.0s)]
*  I'm not as optimistic that we can or even should overcome our biological base to the degree that I think you think we can. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3351.0s)]
*  And, you know, to even go back one further level, like I think I think society is happiest where there's like roles for strong femininity and strong masculinity in the same people and in different people. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3362.0s)]
*  And. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3376.0s)]
*  And I don't like. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3377.0s)]
*  And I don't think a lot of these like deep seated things are gonna be able to get pushed aside very easily and still have a system that works like sure we can't really think about what if there were consciousness in a machine someday or whatever what that would be like. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3379.0s)]
*  And maybe maybe I'm just like thinking too small mindedly, but I think there is something. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3397.0s)]
*  About us that has worked in a super deep way. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3403.0s)]
*  And it took evolution a lot of search space to get here, but I wouldn't discount it too easily. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3407.0s)]
*  But don't you think that cave people would probably have those same. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3414.0s)]
*  About life and sedentary lifestyle and sitting in front of a computer and not interacting with each other except through text. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3417.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3424.0s)]
*  I mean, isn't that like what you're saying is correct. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3426.0s)]
*  How different do you think our motivations are today and kind of what really brings us genuine. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3429.0s)]
*  Joy and how we're how we're wired at some deep level differently than cave people clearly lots of other things have changed. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3434.0s)]
*  We've got better much better tools. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3440.0s)]
*  But how different do you think it really is? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3442.0s)]
*  I think. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3444.0s)]
*  That's the problem is that genetically at the base level there's not much difference. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3445.0s)]
*  I think that's the problem is that genetically at the base level there's not much difference. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3451.0s)]
*  And that these reward systems are all there. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3456.0s)]
*  We interact with all of them. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3459.0s)]
*  Whether it's ego, lust, passion, fury, anger, jealousy, all these different things. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3461.0s)]
*  And you think will be some people will upload and edit those out. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3466.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3469.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that our concern with. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3470.0s)]
*  The [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3473.0s)]
*  The [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dCPytNTnjk&t=3482.52s)]
