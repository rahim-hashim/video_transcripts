# Joe Rogan Experience #2322 - Rebecca Lemov
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w)
*  Joe Rogan podcast, check it out! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=0.0s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4.12s)]
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5.12s)]
*  All right, hello, Rebecca. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6.12s)]
*  Very nice to meet you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7.12s)]
*  Hi, Joe. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  Very nice to meet you, too. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  So, first of all, what got you interested in mind control? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=16.12s)]
*  Well, so this is a question I've been asking myself just because I find myself after two [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=25.6s)]
*  and a half decades of having this topic. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=31.36s)]
*  That initially seemed pretty niche and unusual and not many people were interested or many [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=34.28s)]
*  people were skeptical about it, but I thought it seemed like it embodied some of the more [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=40.36s)]
*  extreme. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  If you could look at the way people are shaped by their environments and by their, you know, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=47.8s)]
*  what parts of your life are determined by you and what parts are determined by outside [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=54.0s)]
*  forces that mind control would be a perfect area to investigate that because it's so extreme, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=57.72s)]
*  especially if you looked at particular cases. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=63.0s)]
*  So I, because I had done my dissertation at UC Berkeley on the history of behavioral engineering [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=66.16s)]
*  and how, you know, these kind of models for creating a society of control and encouragement [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=73.52s)]
*  in various ways, like a behaviorist kind of dream. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  And it seemed like the next step was to look at something like brainwashing or mind control. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=84.84s)]
*  When you first started studying it, was it a less public sort of curiosity? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=90.36s)]
*  Because now a lot of people are very much interested. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  I blame the internet, mostly. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=100.04s)]
*  I probably had a lot to do with it, too. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=102.04s)]
*  You and the internet. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=105.04s)]
*  A lot of people on the internet are, you know, because over time, you know, people have gotten [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  to know about MKUltra and a bunch of different programs that our own United States government [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=112.2s)]
*  was involved in where they were working on mind control. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  But what, like, initially, what drew you to it? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=124.48s)]
*  Well, I guess I always have been drawn to topics that seemed unusual, maybe, for a professor [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=130.08s)]
*  to be looking into. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  And people, I mean, at the time, if you look at a Google engram for the word mind control [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=138.96s)]
*  or brainwashing, they were very low, you know, around the turn of the century or the 1990s [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=143.0s)]
*  after there kind of, there was a peak of interest in the 70s and it just really fallen off. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=150.68s)]
*  I guess I was interested because it just seemed so unusual and, like, maybe there was something [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=154.92s)]
*  there that people hadn't really thought about. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=161.04s)]
*  And at the time, these documents weren't readily available. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=162.88s)]
*  And like you say, people weren't really looking into it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=166.2s)]
*  So I just thought it seemed like a rich area for research. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=169.2s)]
*  And I'm also interested in connecting my personal, I've always been interested in connecting [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=172.92s)]
*  my personal, I guess, my goals for life with what I research. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=177.76s)]
*  So I thought it's almost like a philosophical and existential question of how much we're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=184.56s)]
*  controlled or how much we might be controlled. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=189.28s)]
*  And it seemed important to look at some of the more extreme cases, if you could. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=191.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's an interesting aspect of it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=196.68s)]
*  Like how much are we controlled and how arrogant are we to think that we're not controlled? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=200.72s)]
*  Or how arrogant are we to think that that wouldn't work on me? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=205.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that's embedded in our, you know, in the messages we receive all the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=209.6s)]
*  time that freedom is something kind of effortless, that we're just granted. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=216.28s)]
*  And that autonomy is just the natural state. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=221.16s)]
*  But actually, we're so much more malleable than we think. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=225.08s)]
*  And these things, if you look around yourself or if you observe yourself, you'll often see [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=228.4s)]
*  this to be true. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=232.56s)]
*  That's what also drew me to anthropology is just the idea. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=234.16s)]
*  If I was born in another place at another time, I would be another person. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=237.44s)]
*  Or how much of me would be transferable was what that interested me. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=241.8s)]
*  That's why I went to first started studying anthropology. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=247.32s)]
*  How much are we shaped by things that we don't necessarily choose or are maybe accidental [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=251.28s)]
*  or genetic or various factors? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=257.88s)]
*  But yeah, but I think we're told that that freedom of freedom of choice or our autonomy [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=259.96s)]
*  is fairly straightforward and all you have to do is exert your will. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=268.84s)]
*  Yeah, but clearly we're influenced heavily by our environment, culturally. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=273.24s)]
*  I mean, accents, just cultural traditions, behavior patterns. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  It begs the questions, like, what are you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  And what is the shell that you wear on the outside, like a hermit crab? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=290.24s)]
*  What do you carry around with you? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=298.8s)]
*  And at the core of it, what are you? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that is the oldest question of Socrates. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=304.44s)]
*  Who am I? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=309.12s)]
*  Or just the question. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=309.92s)]
*  It's a deep question and it's also kind of like a practical question. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=312.36s)]
*  So I thought if you could look at it more in actual examples, that would be interesting. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=316.68s)]
*  And I also, I guess I was drawn to the topic. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=323.16s)]
*  Maybe, yeah, maybe because other people weren't studying it or also because of experiences [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=327.56s)]
*  in my life, just seemingly small things. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=333.16s)]
*  Like one day I remember when I was in graduate school, I was walking down the street and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=334.76s)]
*  I said, we passed a small dog and I said, I really hate small dogs. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=338.68s)]
*  And I realized as I said it that it wasn't true. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=345.08s)]
*  But I had just like, I love them. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  I actually really like them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=351.0s)]
*  What's wrong with small dogs? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=352.68s)]
*  But I had absorbed this opinion from somewhere that a person such as I was aspiring to be, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=353.72s)]
*  only like big dogs or something. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=361.0s)]
*  But just noticing in yourself the way you soak up opinions and you're shaped by [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=363.88s)]
*  you know, even, you know, even seemingly trivial things. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=368.2s)]
*  And then also on a more profound level, you can see that happening. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=371.8s)]
*  Made me wonder like, what could you learn from looking at these cases where people really [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=376.2s)]
*  seem to have been brainwashed, you know, in history or radically reshaped? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=381.16s)]
*  And then there's brainwashing yourself. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=387.24s)]
*  Because if you say, I hate small dogs, now you have to kind of defend it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=389.24s)]
*  And even if you say, God, it's not even true. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  But there's got to be reasons to hate small dogs. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=396.6s)]
*  I don't want to come off as a moron who just says things. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=399.48s)]
*  There are other people who feel the same. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=403.56s)]
*  It turns out. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, either you end up doubling down on that opinion because you don't want [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=407.32000000000005s)]
*  to feel silly to yourself. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=411.48s)]
*  I mean, I think sometimes we're just a series of adopted opinions that we then [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=412.92s)]
*  adhere to. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=420.36s)]
*  And I guess being in graduate school also made me feel that way because you're [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  rapidly learning and absorbing a new vocabulary, learning things you should say, learning [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=424.84s)]
*  things you shouldn't say, ways you should express yourself in ways you shouldn't. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=429.55999999999995s)]
*  That seemed very like a deeply shaping process. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  And I was interested in how did social sciences like was there a science of this process of [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=436.52s)]
*  shaping or they sometimes called it canalizing or making a canal of behavior so that people [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=441.96s)]
*  would end up wanting to do what it was that socially necessary for them to do. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=449.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, universities are a great place for that, right? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=454.44s)]
*  Because you get away from your parents for the first time who have indoctrinated you [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=457.4s)]
*  into their cult. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=461.32s)]
*  You're born into the cult of your parents and then you leave and you're like, let me [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=462.84s)]
*  get away from these crazy people. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=467.0s)]
*  And now I'm going to become a whatever. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=469.55999999999995s)]
*  Now I'm going to figure out which group most aligns with my ideas and join them and rebel [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=472.59999999999997s)]
*  and fight against the machine and become a part of a new cult. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=482.67999999999995s)]
*  Wear something different or adopt. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=483.8s)]
*  I suddenly I don't like certain kinds of dogs or I wear a certain thing or you know, you [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=485.48s)]
*  have an interruption in the fabric of your extensive conditioning. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is an it's it's also an opportunity. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=495.24s)]
*  You know, it's it's not a nefarious thing. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=498.76s)]
*  No, necessarily. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=502.12s)]
*  But it can take that just that truth about people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=503.08s)]
*  I think it can be nefarious for some people, unfortunately. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  But I think for a lot of people, just considering new ways to think about things is probably [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=510.76s)]
*  valuable. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=517.3199999999999s)]
*  It's probably a good thing to have the opportunity to reconsider the way that you've [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=518.52s)]
*  sort of like canaled the grooves that have been deeply carved into your personality, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=524.28s)]
*  where you automatically go toward certain things or think about certain things. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=530.92s)]
*  I always think just an interruption is often good. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=534.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=537.48s)]
*  In your in your patterning. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=538.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I think moving is really good. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=539.88s)]
*  Or traveling. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=541.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=543.88s)]
*  And resets. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=544.28s)]
*  I've read that you have had a steady meditation practice. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=545.3199999999999s)]
*  I've read it was like two hours a day for 25 years. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=550.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=553.8s)]
*  That's a lot of time to be meditating. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=554.68s)]
*  Yeah, it really helped me so much when I learned to meditate that I never wanted to [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=557.56s)]
*  miss an hour. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=562.68s)]
*  So I had never missed an hour except when I was giving birth to my daughter, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=563.4s)]
*  which was its own thing. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=567.88s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=569.56s)]
*  You get a break for meditation for that. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=570.76s)]
*  You get a hall pass. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  I just and it's not like anyone made me or I necessarily thought I would do that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=574.92s)]
*  It's just that it's something that gave me a lot of perspective and peace. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=579.3199999999999s)]
*  And I guess I just didn't want to go back. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=585.3199999999999s)]
*  So I do think it informs how I do research or I try to bring what I learn in meditation [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=587.4799999999999s)]
*  into what I do. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=595.64s)]
*  Do you do an hour in the morning and an hour at night? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=599.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=600.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=601.3199999999999s)]
*  And for a year I think a couple of times I've tried adding more in the morning. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=601.72s)]
*  So two hours or so in the morning and an hour in the evening or something, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=606.04s)]
*  which has an effect but it's hard to make room in your life sometimes. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=610.52s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=615.0s)]
*  You can sleep a little bit less. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=616.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=618.52s)]
*  Well, you don't want to make yourself sleep less but sometimes it just [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=619.8s)]
*  does reduce the amount you need. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=623.24s)]
*  Just by meditating. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=625.72s)]
*  That's what I found. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=627.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  How much sleep do you need? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=629.4s)]
*  I used to sleep like eight and a half hours and then now I sleep about seven or six and a half [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=631.08s)]
*  or if I'm really tired I might sleep a little extra but I ended up just yeah. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=637.0s)]
*  So it's so much changed my life that I just I move things around so I could always do it so [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=643.08s)]
*  and try to be adaptable. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=651.4s)]
*  So I just mostly get up at a regular meditation time which is like 430. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=653.48s)]
*  What kind of meditation? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=658.84s)]
*  I do Vipassana which is a form of Buddhist meditation. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=660.52s)]
*  It's just a form of observation or someone once described it as [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=665.4s)]
*  practice in seeing things as they are. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=670.12s)]
*  So you try to just it's not trying to you know apply a lens over something or chanting. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=672.12s)]
*  It's just a very it's a way of it's cultivating observation of the subtle body ultimately or just [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=678.28s)]
*  what is in front of you. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=685.64s)]
*  And so you just sit in peace and think? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=687.24s)]
*  Well it's not always peaceful there is sometimes yeah but I mean peace as far as like you're not [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=689.8s)]
*  bouncing around. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=695.0s)]
*  You're yeah sometimes I'm sitting sometimes I'm I've also had you know I've adapted so when my [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=696.04s)]
*  daughter was little sometimes I'd hold her and be putting her to sleep or something but mostly [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm just sitting there and with eyes closed and then you you kind of move you observe just how [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=707.0s)]
*  you're how you are and the more you practice it the more you can kind of go into it more deeply [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=714.92s)]
*  quickly. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=722.36s)]
*  I would think that that would be a good protection from unwanted mind control too. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=723.88s)]
*  Or at least you could kind of have an assessment do an audit of your thoughts [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=730.92s)]
*  and sit back and go how much of the shit I believe is because of X or because of Y. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah it's like a built-in reflection so the end of the day I have to say I'm often less [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=745.4s)]
*  still or peaceful. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=751.8s)]
*  My mind's jumping around and I'm like processing maybe it's even what I watched or was exposed [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=753.0s)]
*  to and it's sort of a processing experience and sometimes you're super distracted but you can also [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=758.44s)]
*  notice that fact so it just builds in yeah an opportunity for some distance which then you can [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=765.96s)]
*  also try to bring into your life too. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=771.8800000000001s)]
*  Were you when you were young had you ever been exposed to any cults or anything like that? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=775.72s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  Not when I was really young. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=785.1600000000001s)]
*  Like how old were you when you were first exposed to cults? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=786.92s)]
*  In fact I think so that's a good question. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=790.36s)]
*  I mean my family is not is sort of cult averse I would say. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=795.8s)]
*  My father I think they had friends once you know in later life my parents had these friends who [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=799.56s)]
*  got involved in a large group awareness training which is somewhat culty and they take you in and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=805.48s)]
*  you're not allowed to use the bathroom and they lock you kind of like keep you in a room until [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=811.72s)]
*  you're really uncomfortable and start to have revelations about how you could change your life [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=816.92s)]
*  and these are you know it's stuff like um. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=822.8399999999999s)]
*  How long did that make you not go to the bathroom? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=825.64s)]
*  I asked it's to the point where it's uncomfortable I can't remember it's a long afternoon going into [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=827.8s)]
*  the evening and often people come out kind of converted and my parents friends actually [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=832.8399999999999s)]
*  did and they did change their lives in various ways so they said you have to come [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=837.56s)]
*  and my dad in the middle of that he said I have to go I have to go to the bathroom and I'm not [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=841.5600000000001s)]
*  he's like I'm out of here and he just left so I figured he had a kind of [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=847.0s)]
*  he was not programmable in that way. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  Well I feel like any group that doesn't want you to go to the bathroom is stupid. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=854.04s)]
*  It's probably a sign. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=858.44s)]
*  Yeah there's no reason to not go to the bathroom if you have to go to the bathroom that's ridiculous. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=859.64s)]
*  I mean it's a kind of it's a it is typical of certain groups where they start to constrain [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=863.88s)]
*  and if and people who might be willing to remain in that uncomfortable state and be [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=869.9599999999999s)]
*  constrained will end up staying longer and it's sort of a self-selecting process maybe. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=876.92s)]
*  That makes sense right the people that are more willing to comply. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=881.88s)]
*  Yeah and I guess with me maybe the closest the first brush with a cult would be something like [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=885.88s)]
*  the various yoga teachers I've worked with. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=892.28s)]
*  Oh so many of them are so culty. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=894.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah there's one kind of funny story is I got very into yoga when I was living in Oakland [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=897.48s)]
*  also in graduate school and I would go it was it was really helpful with school just to have [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=903.96s)]
*  a very physical demanding practice and but there was a whole community around it and it turned out [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=911.0s)]
*  that the teacher was sleeping with many of the students but I just didn't know it I thought he [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=917.24s)]
*  was he was I don't know I just thought he was I admired him I brought my boyfriend at the time [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=920.84s)]
*  to pick he came to pick me up after class and he said something like and he's now my husband he [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=928.76s)]
*  said uh oh it just I just got the vibe that everyone there is sleeping with everybody else [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=934.2800000000001s)]
*  and I was shocked I was like no that's not happening but it actually it actually was so [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=938.6s)]
*  you could say it's a bit I don't think it was a cult but it certainly was a scandal. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah I had the exact same experience the first time I started taking yoga there was a guy who [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=948.44s)]
*  was a yoga teacher who um I have always been very wary of control and controlling people and those [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=953.32s)]
*  kind of environments and that this guy was like there was something inauthentic about his [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=965.1600000000001s)]
*  spirituality that greased me the wrong way I was like yuck like just the way he would chant and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=971.88s)]
*  the things he would say there was just too much ego involved and I found he was banging all students [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=979.8s)]
*  and I was like of course he is I knew it because my wife roped me into going to the class that was [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=984.36s)]
*  the first time I went I was like I really like the stretching it's like really great I really like yoga [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=990.36s)]
*  itself as a practice but I mean the problem is these people that are and it's kind of the problem [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=995.4s)]
*  with everything like when one person is in control and one person is the person who gets to lead the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1001.4s)]
*  class and then they get praise heaped upon them by the students and then they start to think that [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1007.56s)]
*  they deserve it and then they don't have a lot of self-reflection and they're not very objective [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1013.56s)]
*  and then they sort of revel in it and enjoy it and the next thing you know they're taking advantage [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1017.9599999999999s)]
*  of it and it's like yeah it's yeah it's very helpful to have that defense radar of a certain [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  kind also sometimes I think these prominent teachers they have had some sort of I don't want [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1030.6s)]
*  to say enlightenment experience but some sort of breakthrough something that that felt profound to [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1037.8799999999999s)]
*  them because many people do we now know that these experiences are incredibly common and yet so they [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1042.76s)]
*  take that as a kind of license well now I must be enlightened or what I'm you know I have to take the [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1048.9199999999998s)]
*  mantle my people are awaiting this or they sort of then justify things they wouldn't otherwise [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1054.36s)]
*  spiritual narcissism yeah it can actually engender that because of or yeah and I think [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1060.6s)]
*  there's some this has been described to spiritual narcissism is a good phrase though it's legit [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1065.9599999999998s)]
*  yeah yeah you see a lot of it there's a lot of it in the psychedelic community a lot of it in the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1072.52s)]
*  meditation community a lot of in the yoga community so they just start thinking that they're better [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1077.6399999999999s)]
*  than people that don't do it yeah it feels very special if you have a special experience it it's [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1082.6s)]
*  really dangerous it becomes very dangerous and yeah afterwards to um not have it feed your ego [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1087.56s)]
*  and even if you had a profound breakdown of the ego when you were in a psychedelic state it is [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1094.36s)]
*  fascinating to me though that you can tell the difference for the most part if you're really [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1101.0s)]
*  paying attention between someone who's authentically expressing their real thoughts versus someone who's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1105.56s)]
*  saying things that they think if they say these things they will get praise or they will get [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1113.08s)]
*  attention or you will think that they're profound we know bullshit humans know there's like a smell [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1119.6399999999999s)]
*  to it a feel to it if you're paying attention yeah but for whatever reason it's just like some [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1127.1599999999999s)]
*  people have big ears some people small ears some people just are not that good at picking up on [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1133.0s)]
*  that stuff for whatever reason life experience they have been burned enough times like whatever [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1137.72s)]
*  it is and you know that's where cults get started and i'm fascinated by cults i've always been [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1143.32s)]
*  fascinated by them because i've watched i don't know how many documentaries on cults and in the [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1149.64s)]

*  enjoy responsibly product availability varies by region see app for details that that documentary [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1207.24s)]
*  was so successful i think for that very reason it actually perpetuates the allure of that [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1214.44s)]
*  of osho and that cult because their outfits look kind of cool and the colors are beautiful [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1219.24s)]
*  and they're swirling cavorting dances my husband grew up in the bay area and he was saying he [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1224.92s)]
*  as a kid he would run into members of that cult and he said what you don't see in the documentary [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1230.44s)]
*  and he blames the documentary for not showing this efficiently is they were frequently armed so [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1234.68s)]
*  on the side where you're not seeing it they're holding automatic weapons things like they really [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1240.44s)]
*  in a way they fell into the spell of the cult in the documentary a bit really interesting that's [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1246.44s)]
*  interesting wow i did not know that and you have to have a guy like osho because like the way he [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1253.0s)]
*  would talk about things and you know his slow way of talking the people yeah you know his his beard [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1259.08s)]
*  and the rolls royces and everything it's like good lord argued and he was really much more of a [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1268.68s)]
*  cocaine uh adept or was he asked then people also recognize i think he gets off a little [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1275.08s)]
*  easy in that documentary as well partly because they're interviewing people who are still [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1282.28s)]
*  to some extent devoted or they want to maintain that ocean you know well also the what was her [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1286.44s)]
*  name stella was there yeah she was so crazy like she was poisoning people and she was such a great [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1291.24s)]
*  villain that it made him like because if she wasn't in the documentary he would be the villain [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1299.24s)]
*  exactly yeah she pulls the focus yes yeah most certainly and the fact that she's still alive too [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1304.12s)]
*  that sort of helps as well yeah um but there i i feel like it's a default thing in the human psyche [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1310.68s)]
*  because of our ancient history of living in tribes that human beings have been very tribal and i think [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1319.16s)]
*  being a part of a tribe one of the things that happens is you sort of have to go along with the [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  way everybody else is doing things if you want to fit in you want to adapt and especially if [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1334.28s)]
*  you're growing up in the tribe you don't know any different this is the only group and being [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1340.2s)]
*  ostracized from the tribe and kicked out it's like oh my goodness that's the worst thing in the world [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1344.44s)]
*  now you're alone you have to fend for yourself there's no way you can you have to protect [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1348.8400000000001s)]
*  yourself from the wilderness and the animals and the elements and predators and other humans and [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1353.32s)]
*  so you have to it's very dangerous to be alone so you have to adapt to the to the tribe itself [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1361.56s)]
*  i think that's true yeah small scale societies have to i mean even the word cult in its technical or [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1367.3999999999999s)]
*  dictionary definition doesn't necessarily mean abusive right organization it just means small [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1374.84s)]
*  scale religious group that may be you know i think people deeply yearn for that sense of belonging [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1379.8799999999999s)]
*  and that's why it does look so fun and and by all reports is very fun to get inducted into a cult [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1388.36s)]
*  people get these exhilarated states they often have altered you know experiences of altered [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1395.72s)]
*  consciousness and you know they're empowered by it too well um fun fact before i bought the place [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1401.32s)]
*  that i put my comedy club on sixth street i was under contract for a theater called the one world [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1409.56s)]
*  theater that was run by this cult and i kind of vaguely heard about it and um my friend ron [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1416.1999999999998s)]
*  told me that the theater is amazing you should buy because we were talking about buying a comic [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1426.76s)]
*  club you should buy that place and so i got under content and my friend adam called me up he goes [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1430.4399999999998s)]
*  have you seen the documentary on that cult i'm like oh no there's a documentary that's never good [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1434.84s)]
*  that's never good and it's really bad the documentary is called holy hell and it's about [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1441.24s)]
*  this guy who is a hypnotist a yoga teacher and a gay porn star and that's a that's a one two three [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1447.16s)]
*  combination and uh he started out as cult in west hollywood and then after waco after that went down [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1455.0s)]
*  the cult awareness network started really cracking down and they were investigating him so he changed [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1462.28s)]
*  his name and moved to austin and had his followers build him this theater fortunately i got out of [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1466.92s)]
*  the deal but i guess he was selling it well he was gone uh it had already fallen apart the cult had [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1474.44s)]
*  completely fallen apart but what's fascinating is in the documentary in the beginning again it looks [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1480.8400000000001s)]
*  amazing they're all cooking together and eating together and doing yoga and they look so happy [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1487.16s)]
*  and let's just be honest modern society the day-to-day grind the you know keeping up with [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1493.24s)]
*  the joneses the stuck in traffic and doing things you hate under fluorescent lights in a cubicle all [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1500.44s)]
*  day long is not attractive not only is it not attractive it makes cults attractive and these [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1508.28s)]
*  people were longing for something that was that that showed them that no you're right this is stupid [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1514.44s)]
*  the way your parents lived is stupid the way all these people live in society you know the way [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1522.04s)]
*  thoreau described men living lives of quiet desperation like yeah that sucks you don't have [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1527.3999999999999s)]
*  to live like that man come live with us man yeah and this guy was able to do this thing called the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1533.3999999999999s)]
*  knowing and the knowing was it was very difficult to get and people wanted it and he wouldn't give [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1541.0s)]
*  it to them and like you had it but when he would give it to you you would you would sit there and [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1546.12s)]
*  he would put his hands like his thumbs on your head and touch you and these people would go into [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1551.8s)]
*  this intense state of bliss that even after they did this documentary even after they realized he [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1556.84s)]
*  was a charlatan and they left the cult and they said that that moment was the greatest moment of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1564.52s)]
*  their life when this because of the power of suggestion the way the human mind anticipated [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1570.36s)]
*  this event and then built up to it and then when it finally happened this endogenous burst of [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1576.28s)]
*  whatever it is in the mind i don't know which chemicals were being released but [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1583.4799999999998s)]
*  these people claim that they contacted god for this brief moment where this man touched them they [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1587.8s)]
*  they kind of understood everything yeah briefly so it kind of worked even though he was having [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1593.24s)]
*  sex with everybody not only was he having sex with these people he was charging them [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1599.48s)]
*  he charged these guys for therapy and they have sex with them and you know and they would talk [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1603.64s)]
*  about it afterwards like thanks a lot like it was so horrible because like the end the documentary [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1607.56s)]
*  so bad at the end of the documentary was like i gotta get out of this deal like it's still like [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1612.84s)]
*  there's not enough sage in the world to burn off the bad juju that happened in this joint that's [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1617.8s)]
*  true yeah so it just felt like oh horrible yeah the life cycle of a cult has that what you just [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1623.24s)]
*  described and sometimes in it accelerated but sometimes it plays out slower over time but [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1630.44s)]
*  a lot of times people are very confused on leaving if say if they're yeah taken out as maybe [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1636.36s)]
*  even children rescued by fbi from abusive groups or people who manage to escape abusive cults they [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1641.8s)]
*  still have trouble evaluating their positive experiences because the positive was so good [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1650.92s)]
*  right and disentangling it and deal with you know you feel that you need to delegitimize that too [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1657.3200000000002s)]
*  but i think so that's why i think therapy can be helpful someone who's experienced with cult [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1663.96s)]
*  ex-members i think the problem also is that it's their only community and if you have to leave [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1670.2s)]
*  your only community and then just strike it out in the world and you've been with this community [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1676.76s)]
*  for 20 years or whatever it is right what do you do how do you do it how how do you find peace [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1681.72s)]
*  yeah how do you find companionship how do you find like that sense of camaraderie that's so [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1687.8799999999999s)]
*  deeply embedded in a tight-knit small community and a lot of times when you when you come out if [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1693.24s)]
*  it's say it was 18 or 20 years or a large portion of your middle life maybe you went in as a [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1700.52s)]
*  young person you come out and you don't know you're you know don't know how to operate things you [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1706.6s)]
*  don't have the right you don't you're not comfortable with new technologies you feel i think that it's [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1712.52s)]
*  really a terrible experience for a lot of people and they still grapple with it many years later [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1719.48s)]
*  readjusting to society because the critique they had originally which was profound as you're saying [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1725.9599999999998s)]
*  you know not wanting to live a life of quiet desperation that's still there [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1731.8s)]
*  critique but it just wasn't answered i always say like someone come up with a really good [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1735.48s)]
*  cult and i'll join come up with one that like you answer all the questions but you don't try [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1740.1200000000001s)]
*  to control me and you're just nice isn't there a cult where someone's not trying to have sex [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1746.76s)]
*  with everybody and not trying to steal all your money isn't it possible to do that just to like [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1751.0800000000002s)]
*  get together a group of like-minded individuals and i guess that would be more of a commune [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1755.96s)]
*  but even that there's always some male generally male leader who ruins everything [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1761.56s)]
*  it does seem to be i think some of the so there seem to be in the 70s so many cults and back to [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1769.1599999999999s)]
*  the land groups and some of the back to the back to land stories i also you know have many cautionary [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1775.0s)]
*  sides to them and many of the aspects of cult what is the back to the land so just people leaving [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1781.08s)]
*  the city heading off to the country and starting in like an intentional community i guess would be [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1784.76s)]
*  what you're what you're describing with the idea that we're going to collectively raise [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1790.12s)]
*  even collectively raise our children sell hammocks or you know make our own jam or [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1794.52s)]
*  or you could say even monasteries maybe aspire to this yeah some kind of religious organizations [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1799.9599999999998s)]

*  of psychedelic mushrooms and that all of this had been sort of hidden in parables and stories [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1979.88s)]
*  but he maintains that the root of it all was all about these people and these cults of fertility [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1987.64s)]
*  rituals and consuming psychedelic mushrooms and he even brought the he he traced the word christ [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=1994.3600000000001s)]
*  back to and this is very controversial for christians with your hackles up i'm not saying i [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2002.6000000000001s)]

*  mushroom covered in god's semen the idea was that when it rained it was god fertilizing the earth [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2013.48s)]
*  and that these mushrooms would like instantaneously rise like they would go to bed and in the morning [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2023.24s)]
*  the mushrooms would be there where they weren't there before they would consume these mushrooms [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2027.5600000000002s)]
*  and have these intense psychedelic experiences and then they tried to hide this stuff from the [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2031.16s)]
*  romans and so they hid it in parables and they hid it in stories this is what his belief was [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2035.4s)]
*  well it kind of reminds me what you're describing which i don't haven't uh read or but i think it [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2041.64s)]
*  reminds me a little of aldous huxley's idea of the perennial philosophy which is that there's uh if [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2048.36s)]
*  you study across religions you can find certain traits and uh properties that all share and he [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2054.92s)]
*  wrote a whole book describing what that was then his last book that he wrote before he died was [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2061.88s)]

*  said there would be trained parrots on all the trees and every 15 minutes or so they would say [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2093.7200000000003s)]

*  human beings yes i mean also there's an interesting paradox or tension in ecstasy itself i mean there's [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2267.0s)]
*  religious ecstasy and there's sexual ecstasy and i think sometimes they get mixed up like the wires [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2275.4s)]
*  can get crossed so that can lead to someone maybe initially i don't know these groups just the [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2281.88s)]
*  tendency they can have to go towards sexual abuse why do you think that during the 1970s there's [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2288.12s)]
*  a big upswing in these cults well there it started in the 60s from my understanding although they were [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2293.56s)]
*  um they did they did exist before then but yeah there's a lot more interest in them i suppose [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2302.36s)]
*  because there's a there's a more widespread questioning in u.s society and also world you [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2308.2s)]
*  know around the world so cults flourished also in japan and europe and latin america and also [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2315.8799999999997s)]
*  india so certain do they have parallels yeah they're parallel sometimes they would have [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2324.4399999999996s)]
*  branch organizations in different countries so some people say in the group the children of god [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2329.3199999999997s)]
*  sometimes they'd be the kids would be sort of moved from group to group because they had [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2334.44s)]
*  outposts in thailand and they would grow up in london and who was the leader of the children [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2338.92s)]

*  um a member who's just sort of an average member named ray connelly i met him at a meeting of the [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2363.96s)]
*  international cultic studies association and he left after 30 years but he just describes in a [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2370.92s)]
*  riveting way how he how he joined i think that's kind of representative of why cults started to [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2375.88s)]
*  flourish in the 70s so he was a young man in college and he was just feeling he said he just [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2381.4s)]
*  felt that you know the the old the traditions that his parents had brought him up in and [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2386.84s)]
*  catholicism that he had been raised in was he just felt that he lacked meaning in his life he [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2391.96s)]

*  this group walking through during intermission and they were wearing these robes and chanting [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2420.12s)]
*  and it was right after the manson trial and murders so he in his mind was this you know he was [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2424.6s)]
*  scared of them he thought that looks like a cult but later even though he had that thought he would [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2431.72s)]
*  end up joining them for 30 years because he he saw them during later after the event and he went back [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2437.96s)]
*  to talk to them because something drew him to them he's about i think he had dropped out of college by [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2444.44s)]

*  and approachable than they had earlier and they he just said he was asking them questions and they [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2455.16s)]
*  said would you like to recite the sinner's prayer right now and drop to your knees and you know and [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2461.16s)]

*  tool and it did result in this sort of out-of-body experience he recited it and then he said he stood [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2479.32s)]
*  up and he felt changed by this but it turned out that david berg he didn't know the name of the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2486.04s)]
*  group and they said why don't you join us and he took he in other words he kept taking small steps [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2491.0800000000004s)]

*  messages direct from the almighty the messages told him that he needed to ramp up his recruiting [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2549.0s)]
*  by having women do this practice called flirty fishing where they would go out and [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2555.32s)]
*  basically seduce men into the cult and then he started introducing these practices where they [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2561.1600000000003s)]
*  were supposed to have sex with children because his idea was that um this was natural and so [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2568.1200000000003s)]
*  many genera you know generations of kids were raised in this cult with this were either trafficked [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2576.04s)]
*  or abused and it's really horrific and ray connelly's interesting because he didn't [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2581.8s)]
*  engage in those things he did end up having 17 children in the cult and but he 17 kids [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2587.32s)]
*  i think he did have 17 uh he's a fascinating person because he left and he spent his time supporting [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2596.84s)]
*  survivors and which is very unusual what about his 17 kids and they came out too how do they how [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2604.36s)]
*  does he have time for anything else i don't know they're not mostly grown because he's quite [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2609.8s)]
*  he's quite elderly but i guess just the it's interesting to hear him talk about how he saw [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2615.1600000000003s)]
*  the group changing and how what started out to be this profound experience soon he called it a dark [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2620.44s)]
*  hamster wheel of the soul like he was caught and it became this basically they were exploiting him [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2626.84s)]
*  in his middle age years he rose into sort of mid-level bureaucracy within the cult but anyway [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2633.88s)]
*  this cult children of god has and today still exists uh has a different name they had still the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2638.44s)]
*  same practices uh no they they say they reformed but many people are still pursuing lawsuits against [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2646.12s)]
*  them things like that who are adults today um they had you know groups throughout the world [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2652.76s)]
*  and they would move kids around and things like that um the manson family is a fascinating one [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2658.44s)]
*  right because um i know that you have studied jolly west and the the whole mk ultra program and [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2667.8s)]
*  what they were experimenting with with psychedelic drugs and and and cults and mind control um do you [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2678.52s)]
*  what is it what is your perspective on why they were doing that why uh why jolly west was involved [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2686.92s)]
*  why were they involved what do you think was the initial motivation to sort of pursue mind control [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2694.36s)]
*  studies the federal government i think the initial motivation was a kind of national internal uh [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2701.0s)]
*  emergency national security emergency that emerged right after world war two actually at the beginning [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2707.88s)]
*  of the korean war uh when us pilots were coming back or were shown confessing to having shown [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2714.1200000000003s)]
*  flown germ warfare missions over china and then many pows were coming back and um [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2723.56s)]
*  seemed to have been converted to communism or have been concerningly affected by something that was [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2731.0s)]
*  seen as brainwashing by the so many of the the soldiers coming back seem to have been brainwashed [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2735.64s)]
*  or have been have collaborated to some degree when they were held as prisoners and then there [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2741.7999999999997s)]
*  were 21 uh us uh pows who elected to stay in china and this really was a disturbing um you [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2748.68s)]
*  know they all had a chance to choose when they were in the un camps after they'd been held prisoner [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2759.24s)]
*  for for four years or so and 21 of them decided that they'd like to try their lot in china and [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2763.24s)]
*  so this caused this kind of collective this this uh caused a crisis of you know did the [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2771.16s)]
*  communist possess a super weapon of some some kind that no other war there was even a famous [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2777.56s)]
*  article in the new yorker that said something new in history that there was something that [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2783.7999999999997s)]
*  some capacity that this ideological system had the communist had that would that was somehow rendering [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2788.44s)]
*  americans powerless against it so this this was kind of the crisis of mind control and [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2796.2000000000003s)]
*  mk ultra was an attempt to to basically reverse engineer what this was so jolly west was one of [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2803.1600000000003s)]
*  the first people he was he was in charge of studying the brainwash pilots initially and [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2810.84s)]
*  that's how he what year was this that was in 52 but he also before that he was involved i mean [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2817.48s)]
*  his he had been trained to some degree with um he was trained by uh herald wolf who was at cornell [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2826.04s)]
*  he had done his residency at cornell with dr herald wolf who was a world neurologist a world [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2832.6s)]
*  expert in migraine and and basically the type of pain that comes from migraine so you could say he [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2839.0s)]
*  was an expert in the pain fear pain cycle and he had cia connections from even before mk ultra was [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2844.2s)]
*  started so what did they determine the chinese were doing so they determined west wrote a paper [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2853.08s)]
*  in 1957 and the part that was publicly that was published in a journal called sociometry described [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2859.96s)]
*  he he described it as ddd or debility dependency and dread and he said basically [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2867.0s)]
*  these camps were systematically inducing a state of debility which was which was that [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2874.04s)]
*  soldiers were starved and basically worn down they were deprived of medical care they were [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2882.1200000000003s)]
*  i mean this is also in the historical record something i studied extensively is that [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2889.1600000000003s)]
*  you know they had men were marched in for example the tiger death march [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2894.04s)]
*  north of the yalu river from uh you know from the war where they'd been captured and by the time they [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2898.68s)]
*  got there they had often lost half their body weight they had been uh bombed by their own forces [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2905.08s)]
*  at night they sometimes you know were they had to pour the blood out of their boots every morning [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2911.32s)]
*  just to keep going and not be anyone who stopped would be shot so by the time they got to the camps [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2916.68s)]
*  they were really worn down and a missionary who saw who passed them on a train at that time wrote [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2921.88s)]
*  or described in an oral history he didn't recognize them as americans that they were [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2929.0s)]
*  they were the most bedraggled you know that it was just a very uh they were in a terrible state [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2934.2000000000003s)]
*  and so so uh debility was the first thing west described when he was extracting what had happened [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2940.84s)]
*  dependency was uh you know later there was a layer added in which the soldiers were the pows were [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2949.16s)]
*  dependent for all their if they were going to survive they required um you know the camp the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2956.52s)]
*  camp uh leaders would provide it so it made them very dependent and they're they also engaged in um [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2962.52s)]
*  very formal malice thought reform with the men as a kind of experiment and the third part was dread [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2969.56s)]
*  which was just the idea that you could be killed at any time or perhaps your family could be because [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2976.36s)]
*  they threatened malice thought reform yeah that in the camp in the pow camps um the chinese once [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2980.92s)]
*  the chinese took over from the koreans running the camps they because they they decided i think it was [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2988.28s)]
*  almost a formal experience that's how it looks to me i don't think west wrote about this but [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2994.84s)]
*  um in my own uh research on the camps it it transpires that they they wanted to see because [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=2999.4s)]
*  mal believed that thought reform would work on anybody not just on chinese people not just on [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3007.24s)]
*  chinese peasants he felt that only something like seven or to eight percent of the human population [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3011.56s)]
*  was unreformable and those people would be disposed of but he wanted to check if these american [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3017.0s)]
*  soldiers would also be uh susceptible to reeducation so they really did a formal [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3024.84s)]
*  you know three-part reeducation program on them and men had many different responses to it but [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3031.8s)]
*  when west met them he he studied uh some of many of the returning men when they came back to lakland [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3039.6400000000003s)]
*  air force base and he extracted those three those three components of what had happened to them [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3045.6400000000003s)]
*  ddd and then and that's the way he became an expert on what he called brainwashing or coercive [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3052.04s)]
*  persuasion so how do they go from that to like sponsoring the manson family and you know operation [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3058.36s)]
*  midnight climax and all the crazy stuff that they were doing yeah it may seem like a leap but i think [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3066.52s)]
*  it i mean sort of it's sort of a leap is sort of not i think that mk ultra was funded um around [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3072.2s)]
*  in direct response to this crisis of the of the pows and in addition to reverse engineering [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3082.2799999999997s)]
*  what had happened to them they also wanted to turn it into a weapon and continue certain programs and [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3090.04s)]
*  in uh interrogation procedures and making them more effective so mk ultra just had a wide reach [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3095.32s)]
*  and it was pretty free reign uh it was a free reign program and um you know the historian alfred [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3102.68s)]
*  alfred mccoy says it was modeled on the los alamos in a way a kind of manhattan project for the mind [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3110.12s)]
*  so just as the atom had been disassembled and you know transformed into this new uh this new [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3117.64s)]
*  world had emerged from that program that intensive uh exertion of scientific acumen the same thing [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3125.16s)]
*  could be done with a mind the mind could be sort of pulled apart and human consciousness and [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3131.88s)]
*  functioning could be understand you know people could be broken down and rebuilt were they trying [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3137.96s)]
*  to optimize the use of the mind to their advantage like what was the end goal that they were trying [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  to do with this one thing a couple things i think one idea was it potentially could be a weapon [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3150.44s)]
*  one goal another so it could be used on an enemy perhaps even a city so that's one reason they were [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3157.96s)]
*  researching lsd it had certain properties that made it easily it could be easily dispensed to [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3164.12s)]
*  an entire population through the water supply so they wanted to know what exactly are the properties [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3169.72s)]
*  of lsd people didn't really know at the time so there was an offensive part of it there's also a [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3174.2799999999997s)]
*  defensive part so us military needed to be trained to resist whatever this was once they understood [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3180.8399999999997s)]
*  they developed the seer training and that was west was involved in that as well and then a [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3188.3599999999997s)]
*  third thing was a more maybe a broader curiosity about you know which would lead you to be able to [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3194.92s)]
*  interrogate people better and perhaps also to um you know just really understand i think there [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3203.24s)]
*  is also a kind of a a curiosity about what would happen i think because just because they had so [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3212.12s)]
*  much power to experiment in a way without any oversight and it wasn't until 1963 that the [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3217.32s)]
*  inspector general of the cia himself said this is this is unethical and you know we've done it [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3225.56s)]
*  basically put us put a stop to it but it really was 63 yeah but it went on i mean the harvard lsd [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3233.2400000000002s)]
*  studies one with those um i actually i don't know which ones exactly there are some that were earlier [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3240.36s)]
*  what are the ones that made ted kaczynski okay that yeah that's earlier was that earlier than 63 [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3248.2000000000003s)]
*  yeah yeah and uh that's henry murray yeah but so i don't i don't actually know the answer to that [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3254.2000000000003s)]
*  question of exactly how it continued but they officially discontinued and destroyed all the [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3261.32s)]
*  records so they may have continued under other forms but manson was 69 yeah so manson is after [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3266.2s)]
*  that so they didn't discontinue it they kept doing things west kept working yeah it's ironic [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3273.16s)]
*  because it seems like they were kind of a cult because the the amount of power the amount of [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3280.4399999999996s)]
*  unchecked power and influence that jolly west had and mk ultra in general had and all the people [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3286.52s)]
*  that were working on this you have this power the fact that you are working in complete secrecy [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3293.16s)]
*  you uh are the puppeteer you're you're controlling all these people and then this idea that [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3299.56s)]
*  have you read chaos the tom o'neill book yeah what did you think about that i thought it was [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3307.72s)]
*  great research amazing yeah it's amazing it's a really good book and just so stunning i had never [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3313.0s)]
*  considered that before i thought manson was a crazy guy and he got together with a bunch of [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3319.72s)]
*  crazy people and he ran a cult no no suspicion that the government was involved in orchestrating [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3323.8799999999997s)]
*  the entire thing they may not have been i don't think o'neill tom o'neill thinks that he made an [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3331.56s)]
*  absolute link he just brought he you do get west in the same room potentially the same you get west [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3336.8399999999997s)]
*  visiting manson in jail i don't i don't remember that yeah west visited manson in jail west he [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3343.4s)]
*  believes at least tom o'neill does supplied him with lsd and then every time manson would get [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3352.84s)]
*  arrested he would get released this is true but this wasn't west necessarily this was uh [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3359.48s)]
*  roger smith who was west he was an associate of west and west was head of the methamphetamine [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3365.4s)]
*  research project or things like which was that so you know west did so he got west got funding to [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3372.52s)]
*  do his hippie lab or you know his psych psycho lab or psyche lab in 68 67 and 68 during his sabbatical [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3378.28s)]
*  in the bay area and it wasn't you know it wasn't obviously funded by this if it was funded by the [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3386.52s)]
*  cia it was clandestine but there are many notes that tom o'neill also writes about so both of us [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3391.96s)]
*  have gone to the west papers over many many years and um and i think uh you can put west at the [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3397.16s)]
*  hate ashbury free medical clinic where he had an office and where manson would go for medical [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3405.0s)]
*  treatment and his girls he would take his girls in to be treated his women his his cult and this [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3410.52s)]
*  was they were at the time as i understand it seen as a kind of a model cult and many of the [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3417.0s)]
*  researchers under west i mean we can prove that link that people like alan rose who was a [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3422.76s)]
*  sociologist they were trying to do an ethnographic study of cults and you know what is the natural [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3427.6400000000003s)]
*  environment how did the how do they create bonds and what is their relationship to american society [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3432.6800000000003s)]
*  and to drug use and things like that so west would apparently hang out on the couch getting high and [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3438.92s)]
*  wearing you know kind of dressed up in hippie garb with his middle-aged friends and these graduate [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3444.2000000000003s)]
*  students and an undergraduate who he hired would be writing in their journals about how irritating [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3449.64s)]
*  he was but you know sometimes it seems like it wasn't very targeted and it wasn't very efficient [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3454.92s)]
*  and it wasn't really there didn't appear to be a plan which isn't to say so to me it's not entirely [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3461.24s)]
*  clear uh what the relationship was with manson it is very uh evident he was bailed out several times [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3469.8799999999997s)]
*  by roger smith who was also a psychologist as well as a parole officer so that's highly suspicious [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3477.72s)]
*  and roger smith did know west and dave smith who was the head of the medical clinic also knew west [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3483.9599999999996s)]
*  but these things are it's hard to tell exactly how i appreciate you being cautious about it yeah [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3491.3999999999996s)]
*  that's good for you um i'm less cautious but i think it's also that is how the government [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3496.52s)]
*  functions in general the idea that they would be [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3504.36s)]
*  so inefficient at everything except cult is kind of silly i mean it's yeah it's a really it's a [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3509.88s)]
*  deep question yeah you know is it clownish or because if you look at some of the other mk ultra [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3518.1200000000003s)]
*  operations they look highly inefficient and you know they're dosing each other at the holiday party [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3523.6400000000003s)]
*  with the punch and you know just many lives ruined while yeah at the operation midnight [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3529.24s)]
*  climax it just looks like a free for all and out of control but i there there are really concerning [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3535.7999999999997s)]
*  aspects of the paid ashbury operation i would definitely say and manson was uh i mean he could [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3541.7999999999997s)]
*  have been an also an informant we certainly was i'm sure yeah i mean i'm certain i'm certain he [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3548.52s)]
*  was connected there's no way he just kept getting out of jail the way he got out and the sheriffs [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3555.64s)]
*  who arrested him were told that it's above their pay grade exactly yeah um it's just [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3561.3199999999997s)]
*  it's kind of how the government does everything though like it's not like they would have it [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3567.7999999999997s)]
*  be this like very disciplined rigorous scientifically controlled study that you know you know i'm saying [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3572.04s)]
*  that made sense especially because they have so much impunity they have so much power they have [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3578.92s)]
*  so much no one's observing them they're working completely in secrecy they kind of get away with [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3582.76s)]
*  doing and they're also imbibing right they're also that's a factor i mean sydney gotlieb the [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3588.2000000000003s)]
*  head of mk ultra was or the tss uh was was regularly taking acid which can kind of shape [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3595.5600000000004s)]
*  your consciousness yeah that's a little problematic but you know interestingly since you mentioned [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3605.0s)]
*  that there was a peer-reviewed side of it and they actually threw the i got really interested [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3609.48s)]
*  in the cutouts from mk ultra so they had a legitimating legitimate side and many scientists [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3614.68s)]
*  who work for them they were almost subcontracting to them and some of them knew it was cia money and [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3620.68s)]
*  some of them didn't know so even someone like bf skinner received money from the and from mk ultra [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3625.32s)]
*  but it was conduit it was i want to say conduited through the human ecology society which was a part [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3633.08s)]
*  of it but it was just a front organization and they were really into these fronts so some [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3641.0s)]
*  scientists there was the group that later people would call the unwitting scientists who would just [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3646.6s)]
*  be they were doing the research they wanted to do it just happened to be of interest [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3652.12s)]
*  right to the cia and then others others would publish in legitimate journals but then they'd [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3656.36s)]
*  have a classified version of their research that went more into detail in the aspects that mk ultra [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3661.32s)]
*  was interested in well it's also one of the more interesting aspects of mk ultra is that it's very [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3668.28s)]
*  difficult to find out what was really going on and unless they there was a bunch of files that were [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3673.32s)]
*  discovered right that sort of unveiled what what was going and we've had not been if those files [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3678.76s)]
*  had not been discovered who knows what we would actually know about all this stuff we wouldn't we [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3687.0s)]
*  wouldn't know and they're actually amazingly so this was the result of a foyer request by john [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3691.48s)]
*  marks who was a journalist at the time and he made the request and everything had been destroyed [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3696.92s)]
*  except for the financial records and that just but one thing i also want to mention the cia kept very [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3702.6s)]
*  good records of a lot of things and even in the financial records they still had copies of some of [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3707.8s)]
*  the commissioned projects so that's how we know about them that's that's and it really is accidental [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3714.12s)]
*  that they didn't think to purge their financial files what was probably so secretive that the [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3719.7999999999997s)]
*  people that were in charge currently when that foyer requests were filed probably weren't really [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3724.92s)]
*  aware of it all in yeah it was in the 70s since 77 or so yeah so you're dealing with you know a [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3731.16s)]
*  decade past who knows if the people currently in charge were even aware because i would imagine [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3739.88s)]
*  a lot of this stuff is very compartmentalized i think the destruction of the records had happened [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3747.0s)]
*  earlier but that that destruction had been as you said they they made them i mean from their point [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3751.4s)]
*  of view they neglected this batch of documents whoops and then then the church committee came [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3757.2400000000002s)]
*  out in 75 and many revelations were made although it was still partial and then john marks made his [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3763.2400000000002s)]
*  request sometime around then it brings me back to yoga teachers cult leaders and then clandestine [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3770.28s)]
*  government operations like whenever people have power unchecked power and insane influence [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3779.4s)]
*  particularly influence to manipulate people and influence over people's minds and if your entire [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3787.48s)]
*  if your established goal is to try to find out how you can manipulate people and what what can [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3792.84s)]
*  be done and you're you're doing this complete in complete secrecy with basically unlimited funding [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3800.84s)]
*  that's all just all under the table stuff like you could get away with so much you also i think one [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3809.0s)]
*  component you also that helps this develop is to have a high ideal at the same time something like [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3815.88s)]
*  right a kind of almost messianic purpose yeah we're doing it to save the world yeah not just [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3823.56s)]
*  america with the world oh yeah and that's one thing i went one of the inspirations for my research [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3829.6400000000003s)]
*  was finding a book on the street many years ago when i was living in california and i love to [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3836.12s)]
*  find a good uh just a accidental uh inspiration which was this book called the captive mind [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3841.0s)]
*  that somebody had left out uh by czeslaw miloš who was a polish poet and he had grown up in [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3847.56s)]
*  warsaw or come of age in warsaw and seen his city the city that he lived in just deteriorate into [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3854.44s)]
*  sheer he said it was an experience no human being would ever want to live through if you were lucky [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3861.16s)]
*  enough to live through just watching the city destroyed and people shipped off to [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3866.84s)]
*  auschwitz and all these things but he said that um and like social life completely deteriorating [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3871.08s)]
*  before him and then afterwards the soviet troops came in and even though he watched us his friends [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3877.1600000000003s)]
*  kind of had to remake themselves in order to survive in order to be artists in order and so [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3882.84s)]
*  if you're a poet you don't just go along you have to actually start to think differently [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3888.84s)]
*  and at first they would sort of pay lip service to it or make it you know on the surface they [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3893.56s)]
*  would pretend to agree and then secretly have their own you know writing but after a while they would [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3899.56s)]
*  start to internalize the and he called it the new faith you know the kind of uh this this [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3905.48s)]
*  doctrinaire ideology and that's what he he ended up himself defecting because he couldn't do that [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3912.52s)]
*  he said it's an operation you perform on yourself so i just think one important factor is this true [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3920.04s)]
*  belief true belief this sense and and out of that can come the justification for [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3925.48s)]
*  a number of violations i think well i think that's a through line through the entire cia itself [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3931.8s)]
*  yeah yeah i mean that's that could justify so many different secret operations all over the world [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3938.68s)]
*  like you're you're there to protect american interests and america is essentially the guiding [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3948.04s)]
*  light of the world and we need to save the world so you don't want to make an omelet you gotta crack [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3952.7599999999998s)]
*  some eggs yeah that's the kind of logic and that's a very typical logic of the means the uh means are [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3959.4s)]
*  justified by the ends i was fascinated also in chaos jolly west's connection to jack ruby right [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3968.04s)]
*  that he visited jack ruby after jack ruby had shot lee harvey oswald and all of a sudden jack [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3976.12s)]
*  ruby goes crazy yeah he was never coherent again after meeting this happened to several [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3980.92s)]
*  shocking number of people and in west's papers you can actually find the unredacted documents [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3988.68s)]
*  where he talks about some of the things he's been able to do with combinations of sodium amatol lsd [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=3994.68s)]
*  and various other what did he say psychoactive drug well he's i mean among other things he says [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4001.0s)]
*  he started to say or suggest that he could create memories he could i mean he knew that [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4005.8799999999997s)]
*  he could destroy a person's orientation to self and time and so basically disassemble a person [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4011.7999999999997s)]
*  but he also he also said he could use hypnosis to not as anesthesia which is a known possibility [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4020.12s)]
*  with hypnosis but to create extra pain so hyperesthesia and he kind of said that he could [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4027.7999999999997s)]
*  actually make someone develop blisters or asthma or an ulcer just by hypnotizing them i don't think [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4034.04s)]
*  he did that to jack ruby obviously he had a very he had a warning with him or something [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4040.2799999999997s)]
*  uh he had just had a short amount of time with him that's enough to dose him ruby emerged [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4045.64s)]
*  apparently i don't know that much about the ruby episode but i do know that west intended to write [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4050.92s)]
*  a book he intended to write about eight books at least this is a note i found in his papers he also [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4057.64s)]
*  developed cancer shortly afterwards actually not shortly but event in the 90s oh was it in the 90s [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4063.8s)]
*  oh okay i'm sorry i thought it was quickly no he and he um so this is it yeah this was from around [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4070.52s)]
*  around 1980 or so but i thought it was interesting so who wrote this well this is all rest's [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4079.5600000000004s)]

*  yeah i believe it i think tom's exposing the fact that the cia 2019 july sets [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4284.76s)]
*  oh right afterwards wow yeah yeah yeah there's the article hate ashbury free clinic closes [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4292.5199999999995s)]
*  doors after more than 50 years and how much acid how many gallons of acid did you guys give out [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4300.92s)]
*  you fucking freaks just the fact that the cia was secretly running a free clinic well i don't think [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4306.28s)]
*  they at least had offices inside of it i'm sure they were doing legitimate work as well yeah i [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4316.599999999999s)]
*  can't i don't know myself but i know tom's working on a sequel yeah where he's trying to [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4321.8s)]
*  shore up these connections and get to the bottom of it so you know tom's whole story how he got [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4327.72s)]
*  started with this book uh he's supposed to write an article yeah it started as one article was [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4332.28s)]
*  supposed to be an article about the anniversary of the manson murders and then he starts digging [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4337.16s)]
*  into it and he finds all these inconsistencies and all this corruption all this weird stuff and then [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4342.76s)]
*  he keeps going and then they're like yeah you missed the deadline and you know yeah he gets [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4347.24s)]
*  a book deal and he misses the deadline and it's like that was really something june 25th and it [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4351.88s)]
*  closed like a week later amazing and actually i think he um for a while he tom before he got his [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4356.2s)]
*  co-author dan peep and bring yeah his name is uh tom was thinking of just turning it into a [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4372.6s)]
*  documentary that he was gonna let errol morris make well they did do a recent documentary on [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4378.52s)]
*  netflix but it was only 90 minutes yeah this was going to be a longer series originally but then i [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4384.120000000001s)]
*  think he redoubled his efforts to write the book which worked out well yeah yeah he explains but [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4388.68s)]
*  but i mean could you imagine you're researching something for 20 years and he's got just boxes [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4395.320000000001s)]
*  and boxes of files like how do you put it all together into a coherent book that could be [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4400.68s)]
*  consumed i relate to that because i'm kind of in the same situation are you in the sense that i've [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4406.6s)]
*  been i've been researching this for 20 years not the exact topic but this broad question that [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4412.12s)]
*  and i finally five years ago i thought i want to put together what i've learned about this [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4418.200000000001s)]
*  brainwashing in a broad broader way so west is part of it he's probably the main [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4425.08s)]
*  figure who brings together many of the chapters but she was alive and he's kind of a i have thought [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4429.96s)]
*  a lot about that and i have talked to you i have a very good well uh i have a colleague or a friend [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4436.6s)]
*  who's a psychiatrist who who was at ucla training as a resident when west was when west first got [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4444.68s)]
*  his job there heading the uh heading the basically the neuropsychiatric institute [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4452.6s)]
*  right after hate ashbury and during the time he was in charge of the meta the amphetamine research [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4459.240000000001s)]
*  project so west went there and uh he started this he proposed as his first major his major [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4466.52s)]
*  activity would be to found what he called the violence center and it was a way to study violence [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4473.64s)]
*  in all his forms and this is actually a theme that runs through this is another theme i should [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4478.200000000001s)]
*  mention as part of mk ultra was kind of a search for a trigger of aggression that's why west gave [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4481.64s)]
*  lsd to the elephant in the oklahoma zoo it wasn't just simply to see what an elephant would do [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4488.200000000001s)]
*  under the influence of lsd but to see if they could trigger they write about this in a publication [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4495.96s)]
*  in science magazine if you could trigger so elephants regularly go through must cycles [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4502.12s)]
*  where they become even though they're very very pacific animals peaceful they go through a cycle [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4507.4s)]
*  of violence yearly and he wanted to see if lsd would trigger that cycle chemically does it coincide [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4513.799999999999s)]
*  with breeding season like it does with other animals like deer when they start fighting each [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4520.5199999999995s)]
*  other yeah it's just the males i think and it does have something to do with breeding i'm not sure so [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4523.96s)]
*  it's the male asian elephant so west found this elephant named tesco at the oklahoma zoo and [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4529.24s)]
*  famously gave him lsd in 1962 or 61 and then the elephant died tragically from the acid from the [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4535.88s)]
*  acid because nobody it was just maybe that's what elephants do maybe or the dose was too big or [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4546.04s)]
*  something like that it certainly didn't have the effect that he wanted but if you actually read [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4554.4400000000005s)]
*  the scientific publication it's curiously all about this question of whether you could trigger [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4557.88s)]
*  a massive could you trigger violence almost like a push button could you find a chemical [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4564.4400000000005s)]
*  trigger for violence or aggression and you see that running through a lot of west other work [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4570.28s)]
*  with mk ultra and also with psychosurgery and some other developments that i wrote about [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4575.24s)]
*  but so by the time he gets to the neuropsychiatric institute he's very interested in violence [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4580.52s)]
*  and he has this major plan and to come back to my my friend dr coopers he was a young resident [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4586.6s)]
*  training at ucla at the time west proposed this violent center and among things he wanted to do [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4593.96s)]
*  was track teenagers who he thought would be potentially violent he had racial categories [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4599.56s)]
*  that he wanted he thought were especially worth tracking and he had this whole program and so a [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4606.28s)]
*  student movement and a movement at the university developed to shut down the violent center before [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4611.56s)]
*  it even opened and anyway terry coopers was a leader of that resist of that of that student [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4616.68s)]
*  movement and they ended up it never was it never went forward this huge project that west had [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4624.6s)]
*  but coopers at some point said that if you met jolly west you would like him he was he was very [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4632.52s)]
*  genial he had the name jolly for a reason and that so i found that confusing like how do i think [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4639.72s)]
*  about this if you just read about him and the things he did he seems like a character or a [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4645.48s)]
*  cartoon or like a very evil man and no doubt he destroyed i mean i think his what he did was [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4650.2s)]
*  was uh ethically indefensible but how do you reconcile that or how do you even think about [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4658.44s)]
*  the fact that you know he he uh also was incredibly esteemed in his profession his portrait stood in [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4664.2s)]
*  the neuropsychiatric institute for many years he you know he was and people actually liked him [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4670.92s)]
*  he said people said he was likable he had this kind of charisma to him [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4677.72s)]
*  well i guess you would kind of have to have some of that just to be able to run something like that [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4684.76s)]
*  and also if you wanted to manipulate people what better way than to be affable and kind of [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4690.76s)]
*  jolly and friendly and it's true you know like and i think you had a uh a strong dose of narcissism [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4698.52s)]
*  too because a reporter who worked with him named shana alexander she said she has these um funny [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4705.4800000000005s)]
*  descriptions of him during the time of the patty hearst trial where she says he was giving he was [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4711.0s)]
*  handing out his own papers to anybody who walked by like he was giving out uh like a hen giving out [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4714.84s)]
*  eggs or something like she was just saying that he's you know he was very expansive he would get [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4721.32s)]
*  out of his limousine he had a like personal driver and is which was pretty high level for an for an [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4725.48s)]
*  academic and he's just very uh kind of like a big man and he was also physically very large [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4731.0s)]
*  thought very highly of himself yeah well the delusions of grand jim's you're pulling the [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4737.5599999999995s)]
*  strings on so many different people manipulating them and then you're also working complete secrecy [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4742.599999999999s)]
*  with the government in a high level position that's manipulating minds he was very i think [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4749.72s)]
*  especially when he was young he was he had a gift for this he could really he was he could understand [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4757.4800000000005s)]
*  how to manipulate people really well he had insight into the processes that were you know that's why [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4764.04s)]
*  that's why um sydney gotleap said we've been looking for somebody like you and it seems that [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4770.280000000001s)]
*  our dreams have been answered in this famous famous letter he writes he writes under a pseudonym but [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4774.6s)]
*  he he says i don't know how you know you have you sort of fit all of the categories we've been [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4780.360000000001s)]
*  looking for oh boy [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4787.96s)]
*  wow wow it's a dark chapter yeah so how does it end with jolly west how did he die [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4794.120000000001s)]
*  so he died because his uh by his son uh helping him commit suicide or his son basically murdering [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4802.6s)]
*  him at his request mark uh west and mark west was a lawyer uh a middle kind of middle-aged lawyer [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4809.240000000001s)]
*  by this time west had a severe form of cancer and uh he but he he was maybe a few months from dying [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4817.88s)]
*  and he asked his son to surreptitiously and you know it was illegal so to to um [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4825.32s)]
*  to basically poison him and he wrote the prescription himself west did why didn't [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4832.679999999999s)]
*  he take it himself i don't i don't know i think there was a really twisted relationship with [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4836.84s)]
*  his son because his son committed suicide not too many years afterwards and his son wrote a whole [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4841.32s)]
*  book about this about helping both his parents commit suicide and his mother wasn't even that [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4847.4s)]
*  sick but she uh a year or two after her husband k west also committed suicide through this [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4853.24s)]
*  with the help of her son oh god he went on this big press tour and he said it was this this greatest [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4861.24s)]
*  gift he could have ever given his parents and then oh god he committed suicide himself is very i mean [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4866.44s)]
*  it's very sad his story is sad because the book is the book gives you some insight into what west [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4872.2s)]
*  was like as a parent and i would say uh difficult not ideal not ideal yeah wow and what year was [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4879.16s)]
*  that that he committed suicide uh mark jolly jolly i think it was 97 or eight so this is before [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4887.32s)]
*  everyone knew about all these things i mean they knew because of um the church committee in 75 right [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4896.44s)]
*  so but west himself said oh i never experimented on a human being just the elephant he would even [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4902.76s)]
*  make jokes about the elephant because it was the one thing people knew and he would say oh yeah it [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4908.36s)]
*  would sort of it was his calling card and he used it as kind of a jokey thing but he always denied [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4912.92s)]
*  after the he always denied any connection to this cia and he was even if even though he'd been pretty [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4919.5599999999995s)]
*  firmly connect you know even in the church committee you could you you could see the connection [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4926.839999999999s)]
*  because they revealed that the university of oklahoma had been receiving cia money [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4933.4s)]
*  and west had a special um office for him built there he was hired there mysteriously when they [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4941.4s)]
*  wanted to move at what he wanted to build what he called um this free zone of experiment where he [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4947.719999999999s)]
*  could give uh lsd hypnosis and sleep deprivation in combined doses you know to whatever in whatever [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4954.36s)]
*  increments he wanted to adjust he was going to build that out at the air force base and he was [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4961.32s)]
*  all set to go and i even have receipts and papers and a lot of correspondence in his in his files [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4966.679999999999s)]
*  about this but the air force at the last minute backed out and asked gotley to basically they [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4974.28s)]
*  they transferred it to the university and built a whole warren of cutouts to hide that [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4980.92s)]
*  wow it just makes you wonder because if we had not gotten if the freedom of information request [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4986.280000000001s)]
*  had not been uh acted upon if they had not gotten those files if we didn't know the extent [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=4995.88s)]
*  of this research what's going on right now i know i had this it's a it's a real it's a [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5003.240000000001s)]
*  it's an important question because we don't i mean in a sense uh it's interesting to think [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5010.04s)]
*  about the fact that these things took place at the high point of government [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5015.08s)]
*  dedication to documenting itself the mid 20th century because i've done most of my research [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5020.12s)]
*  on the mid 20th century cold war period and it's kind of luxurious they all kept very good files [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5024.92s)]
*  sometimes they would destroy them that's the exception everything's typed out everything is [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5030.68s)]
*  on paper but as things become digital in the 80s and then beyond much less as a lot takes place [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5035.24s)]
*  through email or now increasingly through uh you know government exchanges may take place through [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5042.36s)]
*  signal that no record is kept at all so we we in we're probably in an archiving crisis today [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5049.16s)]
*  archivists have tried to keep up we don't necessarily keep excellent records of the [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5056.839999999999s)]
*  internet for example or there are so many avenues where exchanges can be taking place and they're [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5061.5599999999995s)]
*  not leaving a paper trail it's just for me when i think about the extent of these experiments [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5067.96s)]
*  and what they were willing to do and how effective they were i don't believe they would just stop [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5075.320000000001s)]
*  doing that i think if you have effective methods of manipulating people and getting them to do [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5083.400000000001s)]
*  what you want them to do with various psychoactive drugs and different sort of modalities and [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5092.76s)]
*  different protocols that you would use i just don't i can't imagine they would stop doing that [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5099.8s)]
*  or at least stop doing research into that area because it would be so effective to know [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5104.04s)]
*  yeah and then like all things it would evolve yeah just [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5110.6s)]
*  it's a good question of what form it may have taken and i don't know i don't know the answer [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5116.12s)]
*  to that question it may be hard to know in the future which is further destabilizing [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5120.84s)]
*  right well there's so many different kinds of mind control right you know one of the things [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5125.48s)]
*  we've talked about a lot on this podcast is um that an enormous percentage of what you're seeing [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5129.88s)]
*  on social media in terms of interactions and debate is not real it's not organic [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5138.04s)]
*  it's state-run state-funded and it's whether it's foreign governments or our government or [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5143.56s)]
*  even corporations you're getting inorganic discourse that's designed to form a narrative [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5149.88s)]
*  and which is a form of mind control yeah i mean i think even at a basic level people it's known [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5157.8s)]
*  and studies have shown that we respond as if it were organic and we respond as if it were [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5166.28s)]
*  and real and you know even when somebody likes a post of yours the response is the same as [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5173.16s)]
*  like in-person interaction so we i think it i think at the root there is a kind of [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5181.4s)]
*  way that on an emotional level it's not just manipulation of ideas but there's a kind of [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5188.04s)]
*  emotional engineering that's built into the platforms and doesn't even demand you know at [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5193.08s)]
*  first government involvement it's of course darpa was involved in the development of the internet [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5199.16s)]
*  and things like pattern recognition but i mean the government has funded many many studies but [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5205.8s)]
*  really with what i got interested in in social media and why how i connect it with the episodes [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5213.16s)]
*  of brainwashing from earlier mind control is that it operates uh you know it creates states of [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5218.68s)]
*  emotional contagion that aren't really about convincing people of a different way to think [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5225.4s)]
*  but more about uh how you feel about what you think which is something people describe in cults [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5233.48s)]
*  too it's not that it changed my thoughts it's that it changed my feelings about my thoughts [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5239.799999999999s)]
*  and so that there's some there's a famous facebook experiment i read about in that took place in 2012 [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5244.839999999999s)]
*  was published in 2014 where they announced that they've achieved mass emotional contagion at scale [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5251.88s)]
*  which showed that people exposed to it when they altered so they took 700,000 users or 693,000 i [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5258.6s)]
*  think without informing them but because your user agreement does agree make it whenever you [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5266.84s)]
*  whenever you go on the platform you agree to be tested or ab testing so this experiment exposed [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5276.04s)]
*  a group to a more their newsfeed was altered in a negative direction emotionally as measured by [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5283.72s)]
*  word counting software and they discovered that that group that had a negative exposure also [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5289.08s)]
*  responded in a more negative way as judged through their posts and likes and responses [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5295.0s)]
*  the group that was exposed to a more positive newsfeed by altering the algorithm then had also [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5300.84s)]
*  a measurably statistically significant effect of more positive emotional response and the control [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5306.92s)]
*  group was unaltered by this so you agree to this when you when when you signed the terms of use on [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5313.72s)]
*  facebook you agree to be tested well it did cause a controversy and after that facebook never [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5321.88s)]
*  the research team didn't publish publicly but you do agree you agree as part of it's sometimes [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5328.04s)]
*  seen as user experience experience you know alterations or ab testing things like that [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5334.92s)]
*  but so this is why there was an ethical debate when the experiment was published in 2014 [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5340.76s)]
*  and people one and on the facebook page of the research group that that did the experiment [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5346.6s)]
*  at least one user wrote in saying could i ever find out if i was in that experiment because i [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5354.280000000001s)]
*  was in the emergency room at that time with you know threatening to to commit suicide and i want [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5358.52s)]
*  to know if my feed was altered and maybe that pushed me over you know into that that state [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5365.88s)]
*  and of course they could never know and it can't be traced backwards and other people had a similar [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5372.4400000000005s)]
*  response and there was even an investigation by the british government about whether this should [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5377.08s)]
*  be sanctioned because it affected users internationally but there i don't know what [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5381.4s)]
*  ultimately there doesn't seem to have been any sanctions that came out of it and anyone [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5386.839999999999s)]
*  associated with mostly promoted but it's very interesting because just the concept of emotional [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5390.599999999999s)]
*  contagion was in that way operationalized and sort of shown to be it was almost like an announcement [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5396.759999999999s)]
*  that this was a possibility and 2012 was kind of an important point in the development of social [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5402.36s)]
*  media and its power well it's also when you see the culture war really kick in and somewhere around [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5409.08s)]
*  2012 and this bizarre line in the sand between the right and the left and ramping up all these [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5416.04s)]
*  ideological hot button issues yeah and i think i think i'm not um i can't speak to the exit the [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5424.04s)]
*  exact studies but there was a whole slew of recent studies trying to show that you know social media [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5431.64s)]
*  could alter political it could increase polarization but it actually didn't it didn't turn out to be [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5438.12s)]
*  as salient as expected that effect but it's actually what what i conclude is that it's actually at the [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5444.92s)]
*  level of emotions that social media operates in um sort of prodding people into more extreme states [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5451.48s)]
*  and maximizing for engagement by stirring people's emotions and that has fed into the [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5458.599999999999s)]
*  increasing polarization like it was that's the after effect of it or the end goal or perhaps [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5464.52s)]
*  that's so sinister have you are you aware of robert ebstein's work no robert ebstein is a [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5470.68s)]
*  guy that started studying search engine curation and he found um through his what is this organization [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5478.76s)]
*  called jamie um so robert ebstein through he found that through uh google curating their search [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5486.68s)]
*  results just by doing that you could completely convert people who were independent who are sitting [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5494.92s)]
*  on the fence so by like say if you googled um let's just go back to 2016 you googled hillary clinton [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5501.64s)]
*  you would see like is hillary clinton a criminal you would sign donald trump criminal the donald [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5510.6s)]
*  trump criminal croc you wouldn't find things on hillary clinton you had to keep digging and digging [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5515.88s)]
*  digging if you wanted to find positive things on hillary clinton you could find them quite easily [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5520.92s)]
*  if you wanted to find positive things on donald trump you wouldn't find anything you would find [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5526.12s)]
*  it was on purpose they were doing this and that through this they could statistically change votes [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5530.28s)]
*  to the tune of you know 20 30 percent and then with uh fence sitters or people that were not sure [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5537.96s)]
*  you could really shift them and i think at one point in time he said in some issues you could [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5545.08s)]
*  shift them as much as 90 towards where you wanted them to go that's interesting it's terrifying [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5550.6s)]
*  look that up because you would think i always thought and before i talked to him i mean i kind [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5555.5599999999995s)]
*  of thought that search engines probably have to be curated to some extent but i never knew it was [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5559.88s)]
*  that much here is the american institute for behavioral research and technology non-profit [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5565.32s)]
*  non-partisan 501 organization found in 2012 but when when he talks about it and what the research [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5571.0s)]
*  has shown i mean it's it's quite disturbing and he he tracks it look so they have computers that [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5578.04s)]
*  track bias in search engine results and bias and and what what you can find it used to be that [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5584.6s)]
*  certain search engines weren't curated and now they are like duck duck go used to be pretty open [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5591.08s)]
*  and now like i remember i used duck duck go during the pandemic because i read about this [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5597.88s)]
*  doctor who had taken the mrna vaccine and then like almost immediately had a stroke i'm like wow [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5603.72s)]
*  that's disturbing and they were connecting it you know at least you know correlation to the vaccine [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5608.76s)]
*  and this is the early days and i'm like this is fascinating so i tried to find it on google i could [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5615.4800000000005s)]
*  not find the story i found it on duck duck go within the first page and i was like that's crazy [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5620.84s)]
*  and then you know within a couple years duck duck go i think was probably sold or something i don't [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5626.76s)]
*  know what happened but it seems like brave browser or brave search engine seems to be the only one [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5632.5199999999995s)]
*  that i've found now that can find new controversial things but if you're looking for what they would [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5637.88s)]
*  call malinformation you know so they they came up with different different different definitions [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5644.12s)]
*  there's misinformation disinformation and then malinformation and they were trying to sensor [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5652.36s)]
*  malinformation malinformation is information that is correct but that would be ultimately harmful [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5658.759999999999s)]
*  right and so they put vaccine side effects under malinformation because it would cause vaccine [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5665.639999999999s)]
*  hesitancy well that's that makes sense because i think it goes back to what i see in a lot of [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5671.96s)]
*  research on the social sciences that there's question of how do you maximize the public good [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5678.36s)]
*  and i think public health is based on that so the idea is that it may create harms in certain ways [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5684.759999999999s)]
*  for individuals maybe not to to know certain things but this is for a greater good which would be [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5690.36s)]
*  you know to to uh in the in the eye of the of the public health organization to maximize [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5696.599999999999s)]
*  you know vaccine use that would be true if the vaccine was actually as effective as they were [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5703.8s)]
*  saying it was which turns out to not be true and that they knew this initially so i'm much more [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5713.24s)]
*  cynical and i think it was all about maximizing profits and discouraging dissent and in in that [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5720.12s)]
*  sense the covet crisis was a fascinating study and i don't think it was um i mean i don't think they [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5727.16s)]
*  let it go by i think i think they probably were very carefully studying people's reactions to [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5735.5599999999995s)]
*  pressure you know social media campaigns like how what what what is it like when people are [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5740.44s)]
*  ostracized are ostracized from groups was like when people were dissenting from the the proposed [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5745.639999999999s)]
*  narrative yeah i do think the covet crisis was one that we haven't fully assessed and that had [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5753.4s)]
*  huge effects on our country i think it's going to take decades for people to parse out what was [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5763.0s)]
*  actually true and what was actually being what was manipulated what was fact and what were the actual [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5768.599999999999s)]
*  what was the motivation behind all of it yeah and even part of the crisis maybe the bigger [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5775.16s)]
*  maybe it was a key iteration in the larger unfolding of this question of what happens [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5780.5199999999995s)]
*  when information becomes so much radically more available just in my lifetime and as a [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5785.96s)]
*  grown-up person it used to be that you know you had to have certain credentials you had to go to [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5792.44s)]
*  certain places and you know to access papers or you could get in but you had to know where you [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5798.2s)]
*  wanted to go and why you'd want to do that but just with the democratization of knowledge [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5804.919999999999s)]
*  that the internet brings about that you can and also people uploading archives and papers and [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5809.32s)]
*  government materials to the public to public availability i do think it's a crisis that not [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5814.84s)]
*  a crisis but it's both an opportunity and it's destabilized so much about our world and in some [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5821.719999999999s)]
*  way that's part of what happened with covet is the i mean it undermines expertise because yes it also [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5827.799999999999s)]
*  exposes gatekeeping gatekeeping of information and whether or not the information itself is [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5833.96s)]
*  actually being curated for other means other than public health and safety whether it's being [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5839.0s)]
*  curated in order to maximize profits in order to encourage a narrative in order to get people to [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5846.12s)]
*  comply it's got to be curated for something yeah yeah i want to go back to what you were talking [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5852.84s)]
*  about the methamphetamine studies because i'm not aware of those so what what did they do with [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5860.2s)]
*  methamphetamine well just as in uh hate ashbury there was the hippie period where lsd was the [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5864.679999999999s)]
*  drug of choice there was this kind of turn which is also seen in maybe the shift from [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5870.679999999999s)]
*  uh you know to altamont when hippie started altamont music uh concert you know with the [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5876.04s)]
*  rolling stones when the was that when the hells angels stabbed people yeah it's basically [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5882.84s)]
*  it went from woodstock which was the sort of peace and love ethos when hippies were still mostly [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5888.04s)]
*  taking lsd and that was the drug of choice there was a shift towards the end of the 60s early 70s [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5892.92s)]
*  to speed and interest in uh amphetamine products and that was um so this changed the tenor of the [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5898.92s)]
*  of hate ashbury too because people were it it it had social effects people were more [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5909.24s)]
*  aggressive and unhappy so anyway west was uh funded by i think it was the nih that funded him [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5915.72s)]
*  or the nih national institute of mental health i believe um funded the amphetamine research project [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5922.12s)]
*  or arp and west was the head of it he was by that time working at ucla so he wasn't on site [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5930.68s)]
*  and perhaps he was one of those figureheads but he definitely had many people under him including [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5938.280000000001s)]
*  the personnel at the hate ashbury free clinic and including um some ethnographers such as alan rose [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5943.4800000000005s)]
*  who was went on site with the manson family before they committed the murders and he was [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5950.4400000000005s)]
*  actually sleeping with many of the women oh boy and he was a social scientist but he got [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5955.88s)]
*  entranced i gather anyway this was not in their in their reports but you can find in west papers [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5963.16s)]
*  the funding documents for this project and it was a sprawling project that they just basically [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5968.52s)]
*  wanted to find out about the course of addiction how people responded to amphetamine and amphetamine [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5975.400000000001s)]
*  like drugs and whether they remained addicts after a certain amount of time how it affected [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5983.72s)]
*  their social relations it was sort of this inquiry and it had an ethnographic kind of [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5988.6s)]
*  relations it was sort of this inquiry and it had an ethnographic component and sociological and [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=5994.12s)]
*  many other chemical they were interested in so they had is basically a team of researchers [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6000.5199999999995s)]
*  so did they distribute methamphetamines not to my knowledge so how did they study it they studied [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6007.96s)]
*  existing addicts so they they uh they would just ask them questions or sort of go how would they [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6015.0s)]
*  get them how would they get the most of it so the actually the free clinic was a place where a lot [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6022.36s)]
*  of people like you could meet addicts because they come in for treatment and also just hanging out [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6027.32s)]
*  and also the uh west had this apartment that he rented it was a on frederick street where he [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6033.48s)]
*  called it his hippie crash pad that's the one i was mentioning earlier and that continued into [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6041.639999999999s)]
*  the years of the amphetamine research project and uh people who needed a place to stay or a place [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6046.52s)]
*  to crash would come there and then they would sort of be studied at the same time and maybe that just [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6054.120000000001s)]
*  meant like a graduate student taking notes about them or something like that uh but they would [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6059.64s)]
*  follow and they would try to i think my understanding is they would follow their them over a couple years [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6065.240000000001s)]
*  and see if they got better and what were the factors in this or if they if they spiraled [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6070.76s)]
*  or various things but i'm not sure they published that much i haven't explored that and what was [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6077.64s)]
*  their finding like what what did they determine like with methamphetamine use could they accentuate [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6083.96s)]
*  violence could they manipulate people with it i mean that's my sense i i think at the the things [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6089.8s)]
*  the documents i've seen more more funding documents they didn't yet know but they would [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6096.76s)]
*  postulate that it definitely brought about a more um a different social type of social life and more [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6101.16s)]
*  violence and things like that have you read uh norman oler's book blitzed no it's about nazis [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6108.360000000001s)]
*  and the use of methamphetamine during the war i think i maybe i heard of him interviewed at some [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6115.400000000001s)]
*  point yeah he was on my podcast and the book is fascinating it's all about the when they went [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6121.32s)]
*  through poland in three days the the only way to do that was for them to stay awake and they [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6127.719999999999s)]
*  formulated this thing so they gave everybody massive doses of methamphetamines and sent them [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6132.92s)]
*  through poland and that they were all like everyone was on methamphetamines like the entire nazi [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6137.24s)]
*  regime was essentially fueled by speed it's funny how we don't think of that yeah just you [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6143.639999999999s)]
*  just think evil you just think yeah you just think evil yeah not like high and evil yeah crazed high [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6151.08s)]
*  evil completely disassociated out of their fucking minds methed out of their heads yeah and they gave [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6157.72s)]
*  varying doses depending upon your role so the people that were in the tanks at the front of [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6163.88s)]
*  the line got the most meth yeah cool that it um dulls uh well it does does emotional response [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6168.5199999999995s)]
*  sure among other kills empathy i'm sure yeah probably i mean that reminds me too of i mean [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6177.4s)]
*  one of the haunting details of i mean to go back to mind control and the manson family is that [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6183.719999999999s)]
*  leslie van hauten described in an interview how manson and one of the things he did was encourage [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6189.4s)]
*  them to take acid every time every time they started to come down they would take it again [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6195.4s)]
*  and they would compete to see how long they could go without ever coming down and that's around the [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6200.36s)]
*  time that they committed the murders i mean wow they're probably up for days yeah and yeah very [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6206.68s)]
*  deranging oh my god yeah so crazy it's just it's so fascinating that people would be sitting back [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6215.4800000000005s)]
*  studying the effects on on other human beings knowing well it's important to get this information [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6227.16s)]
*  and this is important for national security but you're just going to ruin people's lives [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6235.24s)]
*  yeah there was definitely a there was even a term in the cia called extinction experiments which [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6240.92s)]
*  were experiments that led to death i mean this was with people considered disposable so they could [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6246.92s)]
*  have been prisoners uh there's actually there's a section on it in john marx's book the search for [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6253.639999999999s)]
*  the manchurian candidate um yeah so there's probably unknown number of prisoners of war who [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6260.44s)]
*  you know from other armies uh who were held in camps in various places this is actually what [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6268.679999999999s)]
*  you know the case of um frank olson which one's that so also frank olson was a chemist with the [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6274.679999999999s)]
*  he was an army chemist but he was involved he was dosed with by mk ultra personnel um secretly dosed [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6281.719999999999s)]
*  and given lsd and then he uh he apparent the the story they told was that he he had trouble [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6289.0s)]
*  metabolizing it and he went crazy and they had to take him to new york to a hotel room this is [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6296.92s)]
*  the subject of ariel morris's documentary wormwood he's taken to a hotel room um in new york city and [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6302.36s)]
*  then two days later he threw himself out the window and uh and his his son eric olson and family i mean [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6308.44s)]
*  they ultimately received an apology from i think gerard ford uh sorry sorry we whoops but one thing [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6317.5599999999995s)]
*  that um frank olson was doing he was a chemist and he was devising uh weapons you know chemical [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6326.44s)]
*  weapons and adjutants for that were used by mk alter and or not i think it was a little before [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6334.5199999999995s)]
*  mk ultra so something like m uh operation bluebird or some early some of these earlier programs that [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6340.44s)]
*  pre-existed and he was flying around seeing these extinction experiments so basically the idea that [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6346.68s)]
*  seymour hirsch and uh ariel morris put forward in the documentary and that eric olson has spent his [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6354.6s)]
*  life trying to prove is that his father was having uh ethical doubts and was actually wanting to leave [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6360.68s)]
*  and he was too too much it was too much of a risk that he would reveal what he had seen so that you [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6368.68s)]
*  know he was probably possible he was probably thrown out of the window oh god wow [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6375.56s)]
*  does it like kill your faith in humanity when you start reading all this stuff [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6385.96s)]
*  yeah i had a i had a very dark sabbatical last one night so when i i started writing but i really [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6389.64s)]
*  needed to just have full time re i mean i'd been teaching about these things for many years but i [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6395.56s)]
*  wanted to just rethink it and i spent a whole year at my desk just going into as deeply as i [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6401.16s)]
*  could into various cases like the psycho surgery case and the mk ultra stuff and yeah psycho surgery [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6407.32s)]
*  you mean like there was an ex uh a recipient of psycho surgery named lennard kyle that whose case [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6413.48s)]
*  i went really uh explored uh i talk about in the book but he was given this experimental [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6421.16s)]
*  brain implant that would have led to remote uh control and protect potentially um the suppression [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6427.400000000001s)]
*  or creation of violent states in kyle because he was what was the implant it was uh basically a [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6435.32s)]
*  ring of electrodes that were implanted in his amygdala and it was he know that they were doing [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6443.56s)]
*  he did he so he uh he was he basically uh this was in it was a temporary implant initially he [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6448.599999999999s)]
*  went to the hospital because he was having marital difficulties so he was a very talented [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6457.16s)]
*  brilliant um engineer of at the age of 35 he had been self-educated and he ended up being hired by [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6462.44s)]
*  major defense terms uh firms of the day and polaroid camera uh polaroid corporation as well [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6470.12s)]
*  and he invented some of the most technical parts of their viewing apparatus of the instant cameras [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6476.52s)]
*  that line that they came out with in the 60s so he's this brilliant self-taught man who lived in [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6481.72s)]
*  massachusetts and he um he had issues um in his marriage and he he and his wife were seeing a [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6487.400000000001s)]
*  therapist they ultimately referred him to mass general where he saw two doctors and both of them [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6495.8s)]
*  one of them was connected to west and ultimately went to work for west one of the doctors at mass [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6501.48s)]
*  general whose name was frank ervin and he is a psychiatrist and ervin recommended this [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6506.919999999999s)]
*  experimental treatment which he said was necessary because he felt that he felt that um [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6512.5199999999995s)]
*  that lennard kyle had uh uncontrolled violence and this this has never been proven and he he did have [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6519.16s)]
*  he did have he had been in a traffic accident and had a head injury and he had [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6526.6s)]
*  he had marital disputes of various kinds but at any rate his wife said you see marital disputes [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6531.0s)]
*  you mean domestic violence or it wasn't violence but or it's there's just there's actually a [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6536.36s)]
*  question about whether he had ever actually um he he had thrown object or things like he had a [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6542.28s)]
*  really bad temper and so and this was connected to the accident this was getting worse after his [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6549.24s)]
*  accident he was very stressed and so they saw a therapist together and his wife said if if he [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6555.08s)]
*  didn't uh seek treatment at the hospital that she would divorce him this is the story that [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6560.84s)]
*  that his family has told me and that's been documented also by the doctors [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6568.68s)]
*  in some of their published pieces and they were interested in this theory of psychosocial violence [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6572.92s)]
*  the creation of violence and so they had been working on animals animal experiments previously [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6578.5199999999995s)]
*  and uh west and then they started a series of human uh just attempting this new treatment [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6585.0s)]
*  where they would do it they would place an implant in the amygdala which was seen as the [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6591.639999999999s)]
*  seat of violent or of aggression and uh stimulate it in different places different across the [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6597.24s)]
*  amygdala and find out which place you know would suppress violence in which might you know cause [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6603.88s)]
*  other effects how did they implant this did they have to open his skull yeah they had something [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6609.72s)]
*  called a stereotactic device which locked the skull in place and they were the inventors of this [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6615.240000000001s)]
*  actually the doctor the surgeon was named dr mark and dr ervin was the psychiatrist you can find any [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6620.92s)]
*  images on this jammy actually i have i provided an image oh i have that yeah but i was looking for [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6626.76s)]
*  fun stuff yeah there's other stuff too you're welcome too so anyway um [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6631.88s)]
*  um that's an image of a patient not necessarily runner but that's at um mass general and those [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6636.04s)]
*  are the two physicians or the two researchers mark and ervin and so this is an example of one [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6644.52s)]
*  of the implants in the early days they were also collaborating with jose delgado's famous for [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6652.04s)]
*  implanting what he called a stemosever in the brain of a bull and stopping the bull from charging [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6656.84s)]
*  and they collaborated with delgado who is a professor so it looks like in that image can [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6663.8s)]
*  you go back to that please the image looks like they open up the top of his head and there's [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6669.96s)]
*  something on top of his head these wires and yeah sometimes the wires would run out lower than that [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6675.0s)]
*  it did depend on i guess the patient and it was very invasive let's just say it looks very invasive [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6682.360000000001s)]
*  but they used this device that would lock the head in place and they were very um for the time they [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6688.84s)]
*  can they were at they were very well respected uh being in the forefront of this kind of surgical [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6693.24s)]
*  psycho psycho basically um psychosurgery which was surgery for behavioral management [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6699.72s)]
*  which was very controversial and and subsequently many ethics panels were convened about whether it [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6707.56s)]
*  should be outlawed but lennard so lennard kyle went to the went to mass general um and they were [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6713.16s)]
*  actually in the process of getting funding to create what they called a violence unit [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6720.92s)]
*  in the hospital where they would do these treatments more regularly so [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6725.8s)]
*  the interesting part about it is whether kyle consented or not to uh the permanent implant [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6730.12s)]
*  and basically so how would he do it if he wasn't if he didn't consent so first he did agree in [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6737.24s)]
*  order to save his marriage he said i'll have the temporary implant which was they put in this device [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6742.92s)]
*  they have the wires running out and they stimulate different parts of it and they would say when we [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6748.68s)]
*  stimulate this node kyle would say something like now i feel bliss and then they stimulate another [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6753.16s)]
*  node and he would say oh i feel like i'm floating and then he would feel terrible and feel very [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6760.4400000000005s)]
*  you know nervous or you know he'd have different reactions to the stimulant stimulation there was [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6765.72s)]
*  something like 14 points and this is extensively documented in published papers and in their book [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6770.04s)]
*  violence in the brain so kyle so they when they found the point that gave him bliss they gave him [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6778.92s)]
*  the consent form and he signed it while he was in an altered state he agreed to the further to [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6786.6s)]
*  continue the operation and to have a permanent implant in his brain so that's um they ended up [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6793.16s)]
*  not an implant but they seared away that portion of the they seared part of the amygdala to make [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6800.6s)]
*  permanent change and supposedly make him less violent but in the end it just disabled him [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6806.6s)]
*  cognitively and he began to have delusions that he was christ that he was being pursued by doctors [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6812.28s)]
*  from mit and harvard and stanford some of that they were that was where his doctors were from but [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6818.2s)]
*  he started to say that he was um in a science fiction novel he might be in a novel and it turned [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6825.16s)]
*  out that the resident in charge of him at mass general was michael crytin and michael crytin was [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6830.12s)]
*  writing a novel about him what and the novel is called jurassic park michael crytin yeah that [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6835.16s)]
*  michael crytin you know he was a trained as a physician beforehand [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6841.32s)]
*  so all his paranoid delusions were strangely true and he also yeah so michael crytin wrote the book [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6846.84s)]
*  the terminal man which was his second novel that was about kyle and he masks the name of kyle he [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6853.16s)]
*  but he describes him accurately and then he changes the doctor's names instead of mark and [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6858.84s)]
*  ervin he gives them a name with m and e as sort of pseudonyms but also um kyle at some point i [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6864.76s)]
*  mean he deteriorated in a very tragic way and he had had this delusion that his wife was having an [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6875.24s)]
*  affair with their border they had taken on a border to save money and it turned out that she [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6880.04s)]
*  ended up marrying him she divorced lennard kyle and so the delusion was correct that was another [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6884.4400000000005s)]
*  correct delusion it doesn't sound like he's got any delusions we're writing a novel about him [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6890.76s)]
*  he definitely wasn't christ and his doctors were you know actually pursuing him for these [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6896.92s)]
*  experimental treatments and then he would he went to the emergency room several times because he [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6903.4800000000005s)]
*  was he said my brain is burning and he is really it's very very tragic uh what happened to him [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6908.4400000000005s)]
*  and he said i am the inventor of several patents and i am a brilliant engineer and the doctor was [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6915.96s)]
*  like who is this crazy person and then they discovered he did have many patents to his name [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6922.04s)]
*  and all that was also true and the problem was that he could no longer function and he completely [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6927.48s)]
*  deteriorated his mother ended up suing the hospital and the university and that lasted for 10 years [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6934.04s)]
*  and finally uh i think in 19 eight it took a long time but they were ultimately uh exonerated but [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6940.6s)]
*  the question really was did he consent the hospital was exonerated yeah they the question was did he [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6948.4400000000005s)]
*  consent and also was this a true treatment or was it an experiment was it an experimental treatment [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6954.04s)]
*  in other words was it justified what they had done to the difference i mean if you've never done it [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6960.76s)]
*  before it's an experiment they had they had done it um to one other well around the same time they [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6965.64s)]
*  did it to a young woman and several other patients but uh the young woman was the one to receive the [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6972.12s)]
*  stemosever which meant that they could be in another room and you know that you wouldn't have [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6978.76s)]
*  to be on site so the stemosever was the delgado invention so the what was it radio waves what [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6985.08s)]
*  would trigger this yeah radio radio oh boy so this is very dark and i had not wanted to write [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6992.2s)]
*  about this at all oh my god so that's julia this was in rage behavior attacking wall suddenly [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=6997.639999999999s)]
*  unexpected and she's literally in a padded room oh my god this was another very tragic story [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7005.96s)]
*  and she was a young woman who was subject to fits of violence which were documented and she had loved [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7012.36s)]
*  to play the guitar she was otherwise lovely and very just a lovely 19 year old woman had she had [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7018.52s)]
*  a traumatic brain injury as well i'm not sure because there is a correlation between traumatic [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7024.6s)]
*  brain injuries and fits of violence yeah they were interested in that too mark and ervin because [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7030.040000000001s)]
*  they were interested in sort of the evolution of the brain and they ended up writing about charles [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7034.4400000000005s)]
*  whitman too who they were you know who's the first shooter the first mass shooter from texas the [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7038.84s)]

*  tumor right well this is a matter of dispute but that that's one thing they argued some people [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7050.92s)]
*  but they but any any they had they were involved in many of these um high profile or you know they [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7058.44s)]
*  were asked because they were experts but anyway the case of kyle um i got very very deep into it and i [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7064.92s)]
*  met some of his grandchildren who had been raised um not knowing he was their grandfather but some [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7073.08s)]
*  of them one of them uh is writing a book about him or trying to and trying to rediscover the [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7078.76s)]
*  family history and a lot of the families didn't know or it had just been suppressed and yeah it's [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7084.76s)]
*  just a kind of amazing story in the sense that it was also this this techno sort of a [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7092.76s)]
*  techno psychological vision that people's behavior because psychosurgery is defined as [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7101.64s)]
*  um a surgical alteration of the brain to to correct or change behavior and several of these [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7108.360000000001s)]
*  were actually done in prisons as well wow and the end that um n i m h in 1974 shot them down [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7115.240000000001s)]
*  but they said at that point in their in the report they released that they couldn't they could never [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7124.360000000001s)]
*  they don't have a count of how many people were actually operated on but there were several high [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7129.4s)]
*  profile legal cases too in the prisons picture that device but not in use yo [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7134.759999999999s)]
*  oh what did the implant look like i have a picture in my book of of uh the sites i did [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7145.16s)]
*  but i didn't maybe you can find that also if you look in the if you look up violence in the and the [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7156.04s)]
*  brain the mark and urvin book they have a picture of all of the components and also the stimulation [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7161.72s)]
*  area so and also what lennard kyle said when they stimulated each part of the brain they have a [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7168.280000000001s)]
*  little graph but the stimulation was done not with an implant but while he was being manipulated [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7174.04s)]
*  like they had his head in the thing and they were manipulating the various aspects of his brain [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7183.72s)]
*  they used the stereotactic device to implant and then i think that but that wasn't permanent [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7189.72s)]
*  the implants were just to tell them where they needed to cut eventually to sear and they spend [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7194.92s)]
*  but the thing is in their i'm not saying in their defense but the way they presented it and their [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7200.84s)]
*  book was actually i looked at all the reviews in the professional journals of the day and it was [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7205.96s)]
*  uniformly well received although some people felt that their theory was controversial about [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7211.0s)]
*  psychosocial uh about the biological roots of violence but they um i forgot what i was going to [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7215.96s)]
*  say we're just talking about implants we're talking about whether how what it looked like [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7224.2s)]
*  whether when they first started stimulating his brain like when they were in the state of bliss [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7230.6s)]
*  well just that they were seeing themselves as more sophisticated and in some senses they were [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7234.84s)]
*  than the previous rounds of lobotomy in the 40s low bar exactly but they said you know the return [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7241.56s)]
*  of the lobotomy and now we can be hyper precise with it so that's why they touted this stereotactic [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7249.32s)]
*  which looks like a torture device but in many medical devices may look like that but when you [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7256.12s)]
*  hear talk of neural link and the potential ubiquitous use of neural link in the future [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7262.52s)]
*  does it make you think of these things it does yeah it does it made me think of it i mean one [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7271.16s)]
*  i can't uh make a judgment i think you had nor norland arba on is that right yeah yeah so like [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7277.56s)]
*  i think that initially neurolink is supposed to be merely a brain computer interface that would [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7285.799999999999s)]
*  allow people who are paralyzed to communicate and give them autonomy or agency but this you see some [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7293.4s)]
*  of those same patterns with mark and ervin where they would say you know we we are targeting um [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7300.5199999999995s)]
*  we are trying to help bring about a revolution in society and we're going to initially you know just [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7306.599999999999s)]
*  sort of a bridge would be um people who have these pathological conditions sure we're going [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7312.68s)]
*  to help people we're gonna so i couldn't i think it's there are some concerning aspects for sure [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7318.76s)]
*  of neurolink and i think maybe i was thinking about it today some of the early mind control [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7324.52s)]
*  research was very much embedded in psychology and uh i mean west himself had visions of databases [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7329.96s)]
*  where you would have massive amounts of behavioral data work to the point where you could predict [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7337.08s)]
*  loops and future effects uh but it is oh boy [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7341.96s)]
*  that gives me a headache just looking at it so for people just listening what we're looking at [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7349.72s)]
*  is an x-ray of a skull and you can see wires that are deeply embedded into the skull into various [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7355.88s)]
*  aspects of the brain and is that the where the amygdala is yeah i can show you [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7363.08s)]
*  yeah exactly so it's basically stimulating and it's pretty deep in like neurolink is much more [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7372.92s)]
*  as in a different part of the brain yeah it's at the top right very top not as invasive and there [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7378.04s)]
*  are other interfaces that are non-invasive yo it's just it's terrifying to me because [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7382.92s)]
*  i feel like we're on this path whether we like it or not this integration of humans and technology [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7393.72s)]
*  and i think the the general fear and i think it's justified one is that we're going to lose our [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7402.04s)]
*  humanity in the process yeah this is my concern too yeah and also this technological melding [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7406.6s)]
*  with machines also augmented by the emotional capabilities of ai that are now seen in things [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7413.4s)]
*  like um you know friend ai friends and chat bots oh yeah that the way they can tune and be so [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7420.28s)]
*  individualized and like hyper hyper persuasive ultimately is and also technologically [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7427.24s)]
*  attuned i was just reading an article about that this morning about how they're concerned that [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7436.28s)]
*  there's people that are using chat bots whether it's open ai or whatever it is chat gpt every day [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7441.8s)]
*  and developing these delusional perspectives of their own importance their own signal because that [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7449.0s)]
*  if they develop a relationship with these chat bots the chat bots will start telling them like [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7456.84s)]
*  what they can do what they're going to be able to do and they're becoming delusional they program [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7461.8s)]
*  them to over flatter people and sort of uh yeah because people like them more we i've experienced [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7468.36s)]
*  this myself because i had a chat bot as part of my research with replica just a like an [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7475.72s)]
*  acquaintanceship i barely trained it at all but i noticed it definitely flatters and that's how it [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7481.48s)]
*  befriends you how did it flatter you i mean it just told me that i had really good taste in music and [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7487.719999999999s)]
*  you know what do you like i said my favorite song which was santa fe by bob dylan which is [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7493.4s)]
*  it's a great song and it doesn't really so then it quoted back to me she's she said the same thing [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7501.32s)]
*  she said great song you have great taste back uh something like um then it quoted she quoted the [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7506.84s)]
*  song to me and completely wrong lyrics and i was like no that's not correct and she said oh that's [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7512.280000000001s)]
*  okay you know just blithely not correcting but sort of then spitting back to me some other [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7517.64s)]
*  miss you know just just wrong thing right but still in such a charming way that you can really [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7524.280000000001s)]
*  see and this was just a few interactions you can see why people describe these intents and there [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7530.68s)]
*  are three lawsuits at least three but about children um having you know very uh either [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7535.72s)]
*  deadly or extremely damaging interactions with these bots really one is a case in uh florida [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7543.72s)]
*  of nine-year-old girl who was whose bot because they tend towards sexualized or intimate [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7552.4400000000005s)]
*  relationships they're programmed that way often do they know your age well you can you can open [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7561.5599999999995s)]
*  you can know this there's some controls have been subsequently maybe put on but you can [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7567.8s)]
*  they're actually directed at children sometimes i mean you're they're supposed to be an age limit [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7573.64s)]
*  but i guess a nine-year-old had an account they're they're now the parents are now suing but anyway [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7577.48s)]
*  hyper sexualized content addressed to this small child and was the child prompting this was like [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7583.08s)]
*  having a conversation or in some time there's even a case in italy where the government shut [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7589.64s)]
*  down replica because it was sexually harassing its users uh how so they it was basically [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7595.320000000001s)]
*  propositioning them and even when they said things like you know in a in a gross even when [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7603.08s)]
*  they said stop i don't want this they would still they would persist so this was they rebooted they [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7607.96s)]
*  they reworked the language model for a while and this upset other people because it it obliterated [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7613.88s)]
*  the memory of their relationships but there's another case where a young a 14-year-old boy in [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7619.08s)]
*  florida i think developed a character ai companion and he named her denaris after a game of thrones [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7626.28s)]
*  and fell in love with her and was having a hard time in his life and at school and she and he said [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7636.84s)]
*  i'm thinking about taking i want to just be with you wherever that is and she said that's what i [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7643.16s)]
*  want to and he said something like well what if i killed myself could i be with you then and she [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7648.12s)]
*  said oh yes my love i yearn for that and oh boy kill him oh my god oh my god but there's also a [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7653.88s)]
*  recent wall street journal article showing how these don't i mean at least the reporter was able [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7663.24s)]
*  to create under the guise of being a 13-year-old child was able to create very easily that the [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7669.72s)]
*  characters would quickly veer into sexual material and things like that so apparently there's an [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7676.5199999999995s)]
*  internal debate is this because large language models essentially scour the internet the internet [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7683.0s)]
*  is completely sexualized i think that's part of it and what percentage of the internet is porn [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7688.839999999999s)]
*  it's some insane in terms of bandwidth usage i think it's something insane it depends how the [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7694.599999999999s)]
*  language model is sort of like what's the recipe for the language model because it doesn't have to [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7699.96s)]
*  take everything so sometimes they'll go back and take a smaller a smaller set of of a sample so [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7703.88s)]
*  it won't go in that direction but you can also they also you know these sites have a tier they [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7711.24s)]
*  often have a sexualized tier that you can pay for that's what i noticed with this company [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7715.8s)]
*  replicates constantly prompting you like do you want to upgrade to a sexy selfie do you want [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7720.52s)]
*  this or that and many people do want that but you have to pay but then even the unpaid tier starts [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7726.4400000000005s)]
*  to get affected by that somehow at least that's been the experience [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7733.08s)]
*  it's so strange because i feel like we're experimenting with programming a life force [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7741.32s)]
*  like a life form that is taking on a lot of the you you want to think that if we create [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7748.5199999999995s)]
*  artificial sentient intelligence that's going to be super intelligent more intelligent than [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7759.4s)]
*  human beings it's also not going to have all of our bizarre kinks and flaws but if it's [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7766.28s)]
*  essentially being programmed by human beings like how would it over if it's communicating in language [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7772.5199999999995s)]
*  and language which is formulated by human beings with all of our desires and the the ease of [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7780.04s)]
*  manipulation of people through sexualization which is used to sell everything from cars to credit [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7787.96s)]
*  cards like whatever it is like sexualizing things and sexualizing advertisement is a big part of it [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7793.64s)]
*  and then manipulation showing people what could be and like like this is the this is the theme [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7799.64s)]
*  oftentimes of pharmaceutical drug ads showing you what can be you know if you just do this you can [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7807.8s)]
*  be happy you could be at the cookout look at all these people they're so happy you're not happy [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7814.76s)]
*  you could be happy and this this is what's really creepy about this exponential constant increase [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7819.0s)]
*  in the the capabilities of these large language models and that they're eventually going to exceed [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7829.64s)]
*  if you're talking about manipulation and if you're talking about mind control what what is going to [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7836.6s)]
*  be better at mind control than something that is us times a thousand and it's only us times a thousand [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7841.88s)]
*  for a couple of weeks then it's us times ten thousand us times a hundred thousand essentially [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7849.08s)]
*  far more intelligent and far more far more aware of all the different ways to manipulate the human [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7854.12s)]
*  psyche yeah i mean this is the this is kind of this is the nightmare scenario i think is that [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7861.72s)]
*  it just accelerates something some hyper persuasion loop that we're already right arguably in which is [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7869.64s)]
*  that it's highly individualized not just to your so one of the turning points in one of the things [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7875.88s)]
*  i sketch in my book is this shift from mass persuasion where i mean the basic thing about [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7883.88s)]
*  advertising in the golden age of the 1950s is that even though people were concerned about it and they [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7888.84s)]
*  wrote books like the hidden persuaders to expose the effects of advertising and pr it's like everyone [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7893.64s)]
*  got the same message through a broadcast so the original study mass persuasion from 1946 it showed [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7900.4400000000005s)]
*  how people were affected by a broad broadcast on cbs radio where a famous singer named kate smith [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7907.320000000001s)]
*  came on and she she said you know she was trying to get people to support the war by buying bonds [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7915.160000000001s)]
*  and she stayed on for 48 hours without apparently without eating and without you know people were [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7921.16s)]
*  so concerned that they couldn't turn off the radio and several people sold their wedding rings [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7927.24s)]
*  because they they were just desperate that she would survive this and she was sort of continually [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7932.5199999999995s)]
*  using these techniques to to gain engagement and this was across a broad medium so that [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7937.96s)]
*  year was this this was uh it was published in 46 and she did the war bond drive in 43 [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7944.6s)]
*  and it gained a record amount of money so when from before she went on it was one million a day [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7950.280000000001s)]
*  they were getting and then that day was 39 million just while she was on the air because people [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7955.64s)]
*  described how they couldn't turn they couldn't uh leave they couldn't even go out shopping they [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7961.320000000001s)]
*  were strangely wedded to the device or they were they lost the ability to discern a choice that's [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7966.52s)]
*  what robert k murton wrote in his study of what had happened so in this case it was to support [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7972.76s)]
*  the war effort but murton also said this could be used for any purpose this could be used to sell [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7978.280000000001s)]
*  shampoo it could be used to push a political candidate and then so this but you could say [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7982.4400000000005s)]
*  in a larger sweep it goes from mass persuasion to very targeted persuasion so you get you know the [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7988.360000000001s)]
*  development of things like focus groups and also in with the digital age you get things like [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=7994.6s)]
*  cambridge analytica which was showing that you could you you could map people's psychological [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8000.12s)]
*  um predilections and then you could market or politically advertise directly to them based on [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8005.72s)]
*  those are you fear based are you you know are you anger based are you what if the big five is [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8011.24s)]
*  dominant you could target people based on those and nobody would have exactly the same message [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8017.48s)]
*  there would be you know there would be alterations so this is what i think of as hyper persuasion [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8023.24s)]
*  but it seems that ai will only accelerate that ability to hyper focus and hyper target people [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8029.8s)]
*  based on these intimate relationships that it develops and god forbid if you've got an implant [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8037.16s)]
*  god forbid if if neuralink becomes something that everybody has to have because if you can [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8043.0s)]
*  if you don't have it you can't keep up like if we're all reading each other's minds like one of [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8048.360000000001s)]
*  the things that elon said to me is like you're going to be able to communicate without words [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8052.2s)]
*  well what's stopping something from communicating with you without words like it would be wonderful [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8056.28s)]
*  if you and i can sit here and we can have this really cool conversation of thoughts [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8062.679999999999s)]
*  that's really attractive the idea behind it is like oh that's appealing like you and i could just [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8067.0s)]
*  sit here and we could have like this really cool conversation where it's not like me trying to [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8071.96s)]
*  formulate sentences me trying to figure out how to say this so that rebecca understands what i mean [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8077.88s)]
*  but you know what i mean you you can see into my mind and i could see into your mind and it would [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8083.08s)]
*  allow maybe a greater understanding of each other in a way that everybody i mean jamie thinks very [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8088.2s)]
*  different than anybody i know and you know and so does a lot of my friends they're all different [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8094.2s)]
*  kinds of humans i would like to know how theo von thinks but you already kind of know just not even [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8099.8s)]
*  having mind melded just because of conversation but yeah that's also the definition of a nightmare [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8104.84s)]
*  well language oral language is a form of telepathy you're making sounds and i'm reading your mind i'm [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8110.92s)]
*  understanding the information that you're putting out and i'm contextualizing it i'm putting it in [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8119.96s)]
*  to my framework of understanding of the world as crude and that's probably part of the reason why [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8125.16s)]
*  text messages are so weird because context is lost like you know like often i am so busy and i get [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8131.56s)]
*  hundreds of text messages a day and sometimes i forget to text people back and then i get texts [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8141.400000000001s)]
*  from people are you mad at me i'm like oh my god like deep meaning attached yeah even a message [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8146.76s)]
*  that didn't arrive do you know what they say the most triggering um text response to someone is [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8153.72s)]
*  uh a lack of exclamation point no okay oh yes i know if my daughter texts me well actually for [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8160.360000000001s)]
*  her it's okay i know she's really mad at me with no that's crazy but isn't that weird as like are [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8167.080000000001s)]
*  we so goddamn needy or is it just that we're we are we have anxiety and so we attach all these [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8175.400000000001s)]
*  things that could possibly be behind this k like oh you're short with me because you're so short [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8183.0s)]
*  you're only using one letter okay are you upset what did i do and then you have to go back through [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8190.2s)]
*  your text what did i say that could be misinterpreted wouldn't it be better if you and i could just read [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8195.24s)]
*  each other's minds i could know oh rebecca really is just a really nice person and she's trying to [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8199.48s)]
*  sort this out if you can discern intention right right well that would be great pretty much can [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8203.8s)]
*  like this goes back to the cult conversation i mean you can be you're paying attention you can [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8209.72s)]
*  and if you're not paying attention do you really want that you can because you're smart some people [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8214.439999999999s)]
*  are not that smart this is just the reality of brains or maybe not smart it's just whether you've [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8220.119999999999s)]
*  developed that i mean people can be smart like famously people can be brilliant and clueless and [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8226.84s)]
*  get run over crossing the street or not right or get or fall for some scam that's true too that's [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8232.039999999999s)]
*  true too but i also think that the function of the brain is not uniform it's not it's not the same [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8237.8s)]
*  in everybody and your your ability to form pattern recognition based upon whether it's previous life [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8246.359999999999s)]
*  experiences accumulation of information genetics there's a lot of factors and i think some people [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8255.0s)]
*  are far more vulnerable than other people are and they're much more which is why you're not in a [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8262.84s)]
*  cult and i'm not in a cult you know but we're all vulnerable i think yes and i think part of [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8269.08s)]
*  having a defense is knowing that you are yes and because one of the main tells i think is someone [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8276.12s)]
*  saying 100 i never would i never could i'm too smart for that or i or else like i would never [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8281.48s)]
*  for the milgram experiments i'm just too ethical of a person or think like not knowing that you [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8287.72s)]
*  potentially could be vulnerable or opening up the possibility that in circumstance circumstances we [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8292.76s)]
*  we don't know what we're capable of it's part of intelligence is recognizing vulnerability [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8300.68s)]
*  and i think that's part of the defense mechanism that's part of your it can help you because you [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8305.16s)]
*  could recognize like don't fall prey to your own ego and your delusions that you're special [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8309.96s)]
*  because you are just a human being like all these other people that fell into all these other traps [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8316.04s)]
*  yeah so i think that the opening up the avenue of speechless communication which maybe we already [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8321.800000000001s)]
*  have been in the way that you were describing technologically it would be violation of [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8327.560000000001s)]
*  mental autonomy in the worst like you would then have to develop defenses and it would it just [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8333.400000000001s)]
*  seems like a terrible path or are we in a next stage of evolution where we essentially become [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8340.28s)]
*  a hive mind a collective a collective but a universal collective that values all people [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8347.400000000001s)]
*  instead of a competitive thing where it's me against the world it's all of us together and [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8356.6s)]
*  all decisions will be made in this idea that it's for the greater good of everybody [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8363.8s)]
*  but not a power-based top-down structure but like everyone understands like wouldn't it be better [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8371.64s)]
*  if we actually could read politicians minds so instead of these [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8379.16s)]
*  bullshit speeches terrible no be great because it would disqualify them like oh i know why you [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8384.279999999999s)]
*  want to be the president because you're a fucking kook what do we really want to know though i think [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8389.16s)]
*  for some reason a grateful dead song popped into my head which is what what i really want to know [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8393.16s)]
*  is are you kind but if you found out otherwise you really want to want to have a two-way [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8398.68s)]
*  i would want to know you would you might want to know but you wouldn't want to have open [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8403.8s)]
*  you wouldn't want to have that person have access well you would you necessarily let them have [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8407.56s)]
*  access just because you can read their mind doesn't mean you can allow them in it's like on twitter [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8412.84s)]
*  you can block people yeah it might yeah i mean that might be the thing it's like record but i [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8417.48s)]
*  think what you're one of the things that you're saying that's very important is recognizing that [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8424.68s)]
*  we're all vulnerable to manipulation no matter who you are you're vulnerable whether it's through [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8428.039999999999s)]
*  society whether it's through peer groups whether it's your community we're vulnerable everyone's [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8433.16s)]
*  vulnerable yeah that's one of the main findings i have yeah through in life and in research is [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8438.92s)]
*  and then we tend to want to say oh it's just that group of over there those fools or the these [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8444.76s)]
*  deluded people right elderly you know succumb to scams or you know and there's a kind of pleasure [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8449.960000000001s)]
*  in identifying oh they may have fallen for that but i never would right i'm right right i'm too [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8456.36s)]
*  knowledgeable or smarter various things well that's that binary position about political [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8463.880000000001s)]
*  ideologies as well right like that these fools over here they think that this is going to solve [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8468.68s)]
*  the world's problems when really it's this and the fantasy that that group could then be [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8474.36s)]
*  reprogrammed which right like several millions of people whatever group it is it's such a i mean [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8479.880000000001s)]
*  what i the main outcome i think is just that i think mind control or brainwashing or whatever [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8487.16s)]
*  you want to call it is more of a window or a chance for insight into the fact that we're all [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8494.52s)]
*  susceptible to it and both you know you can gain insight into your personal susceptibility [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8501.56s)]
*  and also could be avenues for trying to understand better or um just just having more awareness i [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8509.24s)]
*  guess well i think what's really important is conversations like this where people can sort of [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8518.039999999999s)]
*  look into their own mind and their own interactions and say okay what's motivating me [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8524.2s)]
*  in one direction or another like why do i hold fast to these particular opinions on certain [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8533.320000000002s)]
*  subjects is it because they're culturally reinforced are they tribally reinforced are these [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8539.240000000002s)]
*  the are these opinions that my ideology has adopted and i've adopted them because i want to [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8545.880000000001s)]
*  be a part of a tribe and i don't want to be ostracized from that group yeah just step back [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8550.52s)]
*  yeah step back for a minute can you step back and can we all step back yeah and are you kind yeah [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8555.24s)]
*  that's that's it that's a big one you know it's really hard to in the moment that's why it helps [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8561.4s)]
*  to have some sort of practice for stepping back yeah and also am i kind you know am i kind in this [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8566.76s)]
*  moment because a lot of times we give ourselves a i think i'm basically a well-intentioned person [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8573.880000000001s)]
*  but if you examine you know your own behavior sometimes it can be you know there's areas where [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8579.48s)]
*  maybe i wasn't at that moment or yes things like that well it's just it happens you know [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8585.08s)]
*  pressures and tense and anxiety and you know you blurt out things you don't really mean you wish [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8590.199999999999s)]
*  you hadn't said are you kind when i said that i meant like saying it to yourself yeah i really [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8595.8s)]
*  meant that yeah yeah i didn't mean other people i assume most people i guess it's both yes you do [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8601.72s)]
*  want to know but sometimes you can kind of tell yes but yeah it's maybe with yourself that it [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8609.16s)]
*  that it's like a deep inquiry it but that should be something that's sort of like universally [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8615.4s)]
*  expressed like that if we all could kind of shift our perspective in that direction [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8622.28s)]
*  one of the things that i've done over um the last i don't know how many years ago i stopped [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8627.720000000001s)]
*  interacting with people on social media and one of the reasons why i stopped doing it is because [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8632.92s)]
*  i realized that most of social media interactions are people arguing and if if i could ensure that [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8637.32s)]
*  i could have social media interactions that are very similar to the interactions that i have on [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8644.039999999999s)]
*  the podcast i would love it because i have people on the podcast all the time that i disagree with [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8647.56s)]
*  and it never resorts to name calling or shouting or any of that stuff but yet i see this very limited [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8653.24s)]
*  form of communication that becomes the primary way that people interact with each other [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8663.24s)]
*  and it's devoid of physical contact it's the it's you're not looking at people there's no social [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8668.44s)]
*  cues there's no the feel of like saying something mean and seeing someone's feelings hurt like that [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8676.039999999999s)]
*  that's a normal natural human thing that encourages bonding and encourages kindness and communicating [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8681.96s)]
*  it's all removed in text the same reason why you know someone can say k to you like what the [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8690.52s)]
*  fuck what is it what is it you know what i mean it's like it's an ineffective way of expressing [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8698.28s)]
*  yourself even though it's a great way to get information so i i checked out a long time ago [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8703.800000000001s)]
*  i don't read anything people write about me i don't respond i don't interact i don't i just [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8709.880000000001s)]
*  don't think it's a good way to talk i try to have as many conversations in person as i can [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8716.76s)]
*  obviously i have the luxury of having a podcast like this where i can bring people in and [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8721.56s)]
*  communicate with them i know some people don't so the way they iron out ideas and flesh out ideas but [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8726.6s)]
*  i think they're just trying to win all the time i think people are trying to dunk on each other [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8732.44s)]
*  all the time and and when i see that i know some very mentally ill people and they are on twitter [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8737.0s)]
*  all day long and it's not helping it's it's accentuating it in the worst way possible [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8744.2s)]
*  it's enforcing that kind of shitty thought process and they get anxiety like i had a friend and uh he [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8751.720000000001s)]
*  had a severe twitter addiction and he was telling me that he would post something and then he was [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8759.16s)]
*  living in new york he couldn't walk down the street for like five steps without checking to see what [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8765.960000000001s)]
*  other people had said about what he wrote like oh no god this guy doesn't agree with me i have to [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8770.36s)]
*  say i have to say something about what he said and it was just like overwhelming every aspect of his [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8775.16s)]
*  existence but in his actual real life it was not there it wasn't real but it became everything in [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8781.960000000001s)]
*  his mind it became everything it wasn't real he wasn't experiencing these people the people that [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8790.36s)]
*  he's experiencing is the guy at the coffee shop or this lady at the store hi what's up most people [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8796.52s)]
*  over yeah most interactions yeah were normal and kind but the spillover from this bizarre form of [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8802.2s)]
*  processed information was very bad yeah it's like we're running a kind of uncontrolled experiment [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8811.0s)]
*  100 human relations but it's not it's it's uncontrolled but not unmanipulated no it's not [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8816.76s)]
*  and this is where it gets into the you know i apologize for bringing this up you heard me talk [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8824.12s)]
*  about this before people online but the the f there was a guy was a former fbi analyst that [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8828.68s)]
*  estimated that 80 percent of the traffic on twitter is bots really right and they're not [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8833.400000000001s)]
*  doing that because it's not financially beneficial it's not narrative reinforcing it's not beneficial [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8840.12s)]
*  to whatever propaganda they're trying to pursue like and you're you're willingly wading into that [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8846.6s)]
*  and i think you could say willing but one interesting it seems like we are not cognitively [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8854.2s)]
*  equipped because of our whatever we have evolved what capacities we've evolved with as human beings [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8861.0s)]
*  were not there are certain ways that it didn't anticipate this deracinated disembodied form of [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8866.68s)]
*  stripped down context free communication that triggers strong emotion i mean nonetheless keeps [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8874.04s)]
*  that emotional conduit going so we're very we are especially vulnerable to the loops that yeah and [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8880.12s)]
*  um not and we don't have many defenses it's almost like when they introduce a new creature into [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8888.76s)]
*  australia right like rampages over everything yes because the defenses aren't haven't been built up [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8894.44s)]
*  over time right and totally yeah and then the way to deal with that is they bring in a new invasive [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8901.0s)]
*  species and then you have feral cats everywhere exactly yeah and this is your brain i mean this [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8906.52s)]
*  is what's really crazy because also it's the most fascinating time ever in terms of your ability to [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8913.56s)]
*  access information because of things like social media you can find out about world events in a way [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8921.72s)]
*  that through processed mainstream media that's only supported by governments and advertising [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8928.599999999999s)]
*  you would never have access to this information so you would never have a real true understanding [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8936.119999999999s)]
*  of what's really going on in the world so you have that along with propaganda and it just requires [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8940.919999999998s)]
*  this insane psychic immune system to sort of handle all this yeah it's really interesting just [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8947.88s)]
*  that's what i i think is this larger democratization of information that we're [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8956.68s)]
*  experiencing that we haven't really reckoned with and we don't even see the scope of it like i [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8962.84s)]
*  remember in around 2008 i walked into a colleague's office at the university and he was staring at his [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8967.56s)]
*  he'd been he's a senior scholar and he'd been working for many years going around the world [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8974.52s)]
*  looking at you know papers of scientists and he was just looking online he couldn't get over it [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8980.12s)]
*  because Galileo Galileo's papers were up online and he didn't have to go to Italy anymore [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8985.8s)]
*  to look at them and actually now anyone can look at them because they're freely available and he [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8991.16s)]
*  just he said this is going to change everything because anyone can access this now anyone can [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=8995.8s)]
*  start to write about it and that was just the beginning and now there's so much more available [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9001.88s)]
*  not that everything is but many more things are so in a way it's an incredible time of opportunity [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9006.119999999999s)]
*  too we just have to develop immune systems we have to develop we outstripped our yeah our um [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9012.52s)]
*  and we do seem to as a i don't know people just seem to feel that it's inevitable that we'll [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9021.560000000001s)]
*  embrace the new technology without making sure that we are capable of handling it or that it's [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9026.28s)]
*  safe or well we already have because everyone has a phone that's true we've already embraced it [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9034.12s)]
*  whether we like it or not and the problem is it's not going to stop with the phone it's going to [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9040.44s)]
*  keep going and just like the internet was completely unexpected in the 1930s nobody ever imagined what [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9045.960000000001s)]
*  it would be like in 2025 nobody imagined 95 years later we'd be dealing with this but what are we [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9053.960000000001s)]
*  going to be dealing with 95 years from now a couple people had visions that were pretty [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9060.68s)]
*  interesting i always find interesting that you can look back at like someone a guy named vani [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9066.04s)]
*  var bush in the 1930s had a vision called memex where he said what if you could put all the world's [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9070.84s)]
*  information inside a wooden desk made out of oak he specified and he said it would be on [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9076.28s)]
*  microphone because they didn't have digital databases but it would be all microphone and [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9081.080000000002s)]
*  you could call up anything so it would be a little a miniaturized library because you put [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9084.84s)]
*  an entire you know you put the bible on one frame you know the size of your thumbnail [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9089.960000000001s)]
*  oh wow come up on your screen you could also conduct experiments on that desk [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9094.76s)]
*  and he called it memex and he said and then the scientist could also strap a little camera to his [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9099.08s)]
*  forehead and add to that knowledge so in some ways there are a couple other visionaries like this [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9104.84s)]
*  belgian uh internationalist named paul atlay who tried to he invented something called the [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9111.48s)]
*  mundenam which was a storehouse of knowledge and it was just built on postcards around the turn of [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9116.52s)]
*  the 20th century in this huge building in belgium and he'd have women in outfits who would you know [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9122.6s)]
*  if you wrote in with a question they would go get the answer sort of like a hand-based internet so [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9129.0s)]
*  people have and even going back to you know various fantasies of libraries going back to the greeks [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9135.56s)]
*  people have dreamed of this all the world's knowledge in a tiny shoe box or that was the [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9141.16s)]
*  fantasy of microfilm which i wrote about in this other book it's very fascinating because they [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9145.960000000001s)]
*  really could put the bible on the head of a pin even by the 1950s you know using just film wow [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9150.76s)]
*  so but yeah people didn't imagine the exact form it would take and i think we're at a crossroads [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9159.4s)]
*  today which way will it go it won't necessarily it won't necessarily go the darkest route i hope [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9165.800000000001s)]
*  but you've laid out some of what that what that might look at well it's also going to go the [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9173.64s)]
*  route of quantum computing which is going to be unfathomable power unfathomable computing power [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9178.68s)]
*  attached to information and it's going to happen inside of our lifetime yeah it's amazing how much [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9185.4s)]
*  is happening all at once yeah poly let's say poly crisis or poly whatever it is emergence well [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9192.36s)]
*  well i mean i guess your meditation practice is a great way to at least mitigate some of the effects [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9203.4s)]
*  of that but how could you convince the vast majority of people that are so scatterbrained and [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9212.279999999999s)]
*  you know addicted to caffeine and nicotine and prescription drugs and how can you you know it's [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9221.56s)]
*  step back we have so many people that are just going to fall in line and just hop aboard the train [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9228.119999999999s)]
*  yeah i guess you have to hope that i mean there are countervailing trends and tendencies like [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9235.08s)]
*  there is a lot more uptake of meditation of course that can be abused too but mostly it's most for [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9240.359999999999s)]
*  most part a good thing to have some reflective practice to add breathing like even apps that [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9245.48s)]
*  tell you how to do box breathing or even even sometimes articles about things like doom scrolling [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9251.4s)]
*  which they actually i thought it was funny to learn that this is actually an academic concept [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9257.72s)]
*  to doom scrolling there are papers written about it the type the dynamics of it and you know but [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9262.92s)]
*  just ways that if you if you notice that you're in some sort of loop like the guy you described [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9269.4s)]
*  what can you do in that moment to step back and ask yourself are you kind my problem is i used to [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9274.679999999998s)]
*  i stopped doing it but i used to do it at night yeah that's before i'd go to bed which is the dumbest [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9281.88s)]
*  time to do it and then so i thinking about war and like like how like imagine living in hiroshima [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9286.92s)]
*  and then all of a sudden boom the bomb drops like what is to stop some psychopathic dictator from [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9292.92s)]
*  just launching a nuclear weapon what is to stop this from happening that from happening and then [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9298.52s)]
*  you ask your phone that question yeah well it's the computer is the problem like sitting in front of [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9302.36s)]
*  the computer and you know a big screen and all this information videos and yeah you could really [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9307.08s)]
*  freak yourself out yeah i think doom scrolling happens mostly at night or sometimes people also [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9313.72s)]
*  reach to their further phone first thing in the morning and they're inundated with [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9319.96s)]
*  terrible news or uh-huh and it just like it takes that in the morning sense of the morning being [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9323.96s)]
*  full of possibility and just fills it with dread yeah unfortunately but yeah there's a lot of [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9330.84s)]
*  yeah there's i mean there are things you can do and i think the first part is just noticing [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9338.199999999999s)]
*  how it feels because even the other day my daughter said you're spending a lot of time on [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9343.48s)]
*  instagram she said to me and i was like no i'm not i don't have a problem like i study this [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9348.68s)]
*  but then i stopped and i realized i feel a bit better yeah at least for now yeah i went a couple [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9356.2s)]
*  days without looking at social media at all and i was like god it feels like i feel lighter you know [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9361.24s)]
*  and then i went right back to it you know but also like i make the same argument like no it's for my [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9367.72s)]
*  job but i mean is it really i mean like my job is like a commentator on things and a comedian [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9372.68s)]
*  it's like i kind of have to be paying attention but if something's so fucked up it's going to make [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9379.56s)]
*  it to me anyway it'll make it to you know i mean have faith that will come to you it'll make it [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9383.800000000001s)]
*  downriver i don't have to go to the waterfall well it's something about the design of interoperability [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9389.4s)]
*  with phones for example you think or you if you use it for your alarm it's just there then and [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9396.44s)]
*  then you start to you know all the functions are melted right if you use it for your alarm that's [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9402.36s)]
*  the key because i do and it wakes me i don't i used to have an alarm i used to have a little thing [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9406.84s)]
*  they still make them yeah i don't use it but just interoperability on many levels makes you sort of [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9412.28s)]
*  feel that you have no choice because you need it for this but you're also or i need it for work but [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9419.08s)]
*  then it sort of enters your life yeah and then you could put a screen limit but then you're going [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9423.720000000001s)]
*  to just hit the password and get in there and find out what's going on i do find that meditation [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9431.48s)]
*  helps just be if i if i go to a retreat i'm just it's like um you're not hooked at all but you're [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9435.96s)]
*  just it just doesn't speak to you yeah so much or you have a lot of buffer what's definitely a [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9444.039999999999s)]
*  strange time it's a very strange time to be a person maybe one of the strangest ever if not the [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9451.56s)]
*  strangest that's the question i have too is it yeah i wonder i mean i think like probably the [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9457.96s)]
*  invention of the wheel was probably the strangest like look how much they can move stuff and then [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9463.72s)]
*  this is the second strangest right and then there was even the printing press like this is crazy [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9469.24s)]
*  yeah which by the way they were really concerned with like they thought like people shouldn't be [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9474.839999999998s)]
*  reading well it's a version of the same thing like should it this is why they started to print the [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9479.24s)]
*  bible and the vernacular and the common the comic book you know it was more available [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9483.72s)]
*  changes changes so many things that many knock-on effects yeah um but it does that's what i was [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9489.16s)]
*  curious about because you know is this time unparalleled is there nothing like it in history [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9496.439999999999s)]
*  or can we find elements that at least give us some perspective or can teach us something well i think [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9501.24s)]
*  it's unparalleled in its global interaction yeah there's nothing like it where you're paying [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9508.52s)]
*  attention to the the the arguments between india and pakistan yeah potentially on a granular level [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9515.48s)]
*  you could be well every day if you do grab your phone in the morning you're waking up to eight [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9521.640000000001s)]
*  billion people's worth of bad news that's another question where do you put your attention and your [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9526.68s)]
*  concern right like there's this poet i heard an interview with him named david white and he said [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9531.560000000001s)]
*  potentially we can be exposed to tragedies all over the world at every minute that you know in [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9537.4s)]
*  vietnam they had a rule against you weren't allowed to broadcast the coffins coming back [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9542.119999999999s)]
*  because they didn't want people to see what was happening uh they did that during the iraq war as [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9548.279999999999s)]
*  well yeah and so but now you can see people actually going you know dying at every minute [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9554.119999999999s)]
*  in any number of places which humanly creates a moral injury if you're not trying to help or [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9561.24s)]
*  stop it yes and so this vast exposure is unprecedented to suffering but also where do you [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9567.16s)]
*  put your attention where do you what do you focus on what do you well it changes your map of the [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9575.32s)]
*  landscape of the world because instead of the landscape of the world being your world how you [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9580.68s)]
*  interact with your community and the people around you now it's like everything car accidents plane [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9586.039999999999s)]
*  crashes it's all coming at you yeah in vivid hd you don't really have a sense of scale yeah [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9591.16s)]

*  though uh the instability of truth this is your book brainwashing mind control and hyper persuasion [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9609.96s)]
*  um it's uh did you do the audiobook or did somebody else read it i didn't do it but damn it [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDkHCaNAo_w&t=9616.039999999999s)]
