# Joe Rogan Experience #1906 - David Goggins
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeah, you do a podcast every fucking day, man? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=10.0s)]
*  Pretty much. This week, every day. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=15.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=17.0s)]
*  But I was just on vacation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=18.0s)]
*  How was vacation? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=20.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=21.0s)]
*  Vacations are hard, you know, because like, even though I enjoy rest, I always feel like I shouldn't be. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=22.0s)]
*  Always. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=29.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=30.0s)]
*  Do you go on vacations? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=31.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=33.0s)]
*  Never? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=34.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=35.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=36.0s)]
*  For me, creatively, it's good. It's good to get a reset, because I come back in guns blazing like I really don't risk any mental burnout when I do it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, I have resets, but my resets are like, I call them aid stations. Mental aid stations. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=47.0s)]
*  So when you're going fucking hard and you're grinding all the fucking time, like everybody knows, you're 24 hours in the day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=53.0s)]
*  But when I'm in the shower, it's a mental aid station. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=59.0s)]
*  I don't think about shit. I don't fucking think about people. I don't think about work. I don't think about running. I don't think about working out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=62.0s)]
*  When I'm in the car, another fucking mental aid station. When I'm fucking eating, mental aid station. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=69.0s)]
*  So people eat and they work and all that sort of shit, man. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=74.0s)]
*  So I can grind hard because a lot of times, I'm in mental fucking aid stations. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=77.0s)]
*  Chilling. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=82.0s)]
*  So you have little mini vacations. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=83.0s)]
*  Mini vacations, man. All day long. All day long. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=85.0s)]
*  Do you feel now almost a responsibility to stay at it all the time because so many people are watching and paying attention and drawing inspiration from you? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=88.0s)]
*  100%. I mean, I probably would have retired a long time ago. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=99.0s)]
*  But I get these emails from people and it's like they're living through me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=103.0s)]
*  Like their strength comes through what they know I'm doing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=110.0s)]
*  So there's so many times I want to get up and say, oh man, fuck it, man. I got mine. I'm good. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=115.0s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck. Fucking Tommy out there, motherfucker. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=119.0s)]
*  Fucking Tommy talking about. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=124.0s)]
*  Tommy in his email. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=125.0s)]
*  Tommy talking about. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=126.0s)]
*  He saved his life. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=127.0s)]
*  Man, I ran 10 miles last night because of you, man. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=128.0s)]
*  I'm like, you know, a lot of people can live off of that and they can fucking be good with that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=131.0s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of motivational people come out here, man, and run their motherfucking mouths about shit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=135.0s)]
*  And I know they are not doing shit. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=141.0s)]
*  They sit back and they're fucking like, you know, they have their little brainstorming sessions about, oh, what should we say? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=144.0s)]
*  What's going to connect with people while they're sitting there fucking ass? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=150.0s)]
*  My brainstorming sessions is fucking out there in the fucking grip of life, fucking grinding. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=154.0s)]
*  And that's where all my material comes from to suck. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=159.0s)]
*  Every bit of it comes from the suck. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=163.0s)]
*  And that's the difference between there's like a whole industry now that's dedicated to trying to help people get motivated. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=165.0s)]
*  And a lot of the people that are involved in that are very unqualified. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=173.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=177.0s)]
*  Because they're not really doing anything. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=178.0s)]
*  No. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=179.0s)]
*  There's so many people that haven't actually done anything, but they'll try to teach you how to get your life in order and how to get your mind right and develop that warrior mentality. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=180.0s)]
*  I'm like, bitch, you don't have that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=190.0s)]
*  Well, they're utilizing the weakness of the world right now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=192.0s)]
*  The world's in a very bad place. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=194.0s)]
*  So these people who are like car artists, they sit back and say, oh, I can come up with this. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=197.0s)]
*  I can come up with this and this right here can probably make me some money. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=203.0s)]
*  So they're in it for fucked up reasons. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=206.0s)]
*  There's just not a whole lot of people like you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=209.0s)]
*  You know, I love that phrase, uncommon amongst uncommon men, because it's such a good phrase because it just shows you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=211.0s)]
*  You've been on this path for so long and you're grinding for so long. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=220.0s)]
*  But you're also honest about there's moments where you don't want to fucking do this, which is why it's so interesting because you do it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=225.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=235.0s)]
*  You do it without any reservation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=236.0s)]
*  You just go through it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=238.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=239.0s)]
*  But you always talk about I don't want to fucking do this shit. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=240.0s)]
*  But you always do it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=242.0s)]
*  But that's what people need to hear because they feel like that somewhere out there, there's some superhuman person who never feels despair and doesn't have any. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=244.0s)]
*  There's there's no no hesitation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=253.0s)]
*  So they feel like there's this person that's so different than them and so much stronger than them and doesn't ever have any procrastination. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=259.0s)]
*  And you're like, that's not me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=268.0s)]
*  No, I love that phrase. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=270.0s)]
*  You told me once he goes, sometimes I look at my fucking shoes for a half an hour before I put those bitches on. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=271.0s)]
*  It's a true statement. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=277.0s)]
*  But but what I do, though, man, is I I came with this thing called perform without purpose. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=279.0s)]
*  And so many people, they need to have a five K, a 10 K. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=284.0s)]
*  I need to have a course in front of me. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=288.0s)]
*  I need to have something in front of me for me to get my fucking ass up and do some shit. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=291.0s)]
*  And that used to be me. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=296.0s)]
*  And nowadays, you know, shit for the past 20 some years, I don't need fucking purpose. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=298.0s)]
*  And people miss out on this man. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=304.0s)]
*  The purpose. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=305.0s)]
*  We're all looking for this golden purpose. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=306.0s)]
*  Is it this? Is it that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=308.0s)]
*  Is it making money? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=309.0s)]
*  Is it my family? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=310.0s)]
*  Motherfucker, the purpose is you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=312.0s)]
*  We forget that every fucking day I wake up and I don't want to do some fucking shit. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=314.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, man, do you want to be a bitch today? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=319.0s)]
*  Do you want to feel like a little bitch? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=321.0s)]
*  Do you want to walk around all day knowing that you could, but you didn't? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=323.0s)]
*  So I it's performed without purpose. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=326.0s)]
*  You have to learn how to get up and do shit when you ain't got no fucking five K, no 10 K. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=329.0s)]
*  Nothing. Nothing exists. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=334.0s)]
*  Your life fucking sucks. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=336.0s)]
*  You're in the fucking dungeon. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=337.0s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=339.0s)]
*  Motherfucker, I'm still going to get it because when that time comes, because the time is going to come when that purpose is there, you'll be ready. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=340.0s)]
*  But most of us fucking already because we don't know how to do without having the golden carrot in front of us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=350.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=356.0s)]
*  And so you're all fucked. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=357.0s)]
*  There's also this thing where if you do it, once it's over, you get a break. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=358.0s)]
*  Oh, like that's what a 10 K is. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=362.0s)]
*  That's what a marathon is. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=364.0s)]
*  I'm going to train for this marathon. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=365.0s)]
*  And you're training and you're training for that big day, but you're also recognizing when that marathon is over. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=367.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=373.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=374.0s)]
*  And as you get better at that moment, the moment becomes less and less. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=375.0s)]
*  So my moments now are like, oh, I ran today. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=380.0s)]
*  I went to the gym today. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=383.0s)]
*  I did this and this today. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=384.0s)]
*  I studied today. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=385.0s)]
*  About eight hours off in those eight hours are glorious to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=387.0s)]
*  And every day you go back out and you start earning that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=391.0s)]
*  And every day you wake up, it sucks. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=394.0s)]
*  And when it's over, you feel better. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=396.0s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=398.0s)]
*  You feel better. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=399.0s)]
*  And as you get going, every step you take in that journey, as you're like for me, run. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=400.0s)]
*  I run every day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=405.0s)]
*  Fucking hate it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=406.0s)]
*  But every step I take, I'm like, all right, motherfucker, you're beating the demon again. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=407.0s)]
*  You run every day, but I don't think people understand how fucked up your knees are. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=411.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=416.0s)]
*  You run over. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=417.0s)]
*  When you sent me that X-ray after your surgery and I looked at what they did to your knee [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=418.0s)]
*  and I looked at what it looks like, what the actual bone on bone looks like and how it had distorted [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=425.0s)]
*  because there's no cushioning at all. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=434.0s)]
*  And the doctor said to you, I can't even believe you could fucking walk on these knees. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=436.0s)]
*  Forget about run thousands of miles. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=441.0s)]
*  So you're doing this every day in constant pain. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=443.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=447.0s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=448.0s)]
*  Well, I don't suggest... [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=449.0s)]
*  Explain your knees, first of all. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=450.0s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=452.0s)]
*  So people think that my knees are bad from a lot of running and they're wrong. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=453.0s)]
*  I wasn't born healthy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=458.0s)]
*  I wasn't born with some great body alignment, some great, you know, I have sickle cell. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=460.0s)]
*  I have all kinds of shit. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=465.0s)]
*  I have all kinds of health issues, you know, all kinds. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=466.0s)]
*  I'm fucked up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=469.0s)]
*  So I had a choice to make. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=470.0s)]
*  And the choice was, you know, growing up, you know, okay, this hurts, that hurts. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=472.0s)]
*  We can just sit down and do nothing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=476.0s)]
*  Or we can see how far we can push the human body. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=479.0s)]
*  So on that journey, as I started getting more and more into my mind and start realizing [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=482.0s)]
*  that while what I'm capable of doing, my mind got stronger. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=487.0s)]
*  So the pain in my knees, while it sucked, I've been doing it for so long. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=491.0s)]
*  It was like it became my new norm. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=497.0s)]
*  Like, okay, my knees hurt. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=499.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=501.0s)]
*  Stop. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=502.0s)]
*  And I call it like I'm stop feeling sorry for yourself. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=503.0s)]
*  But you sometimes have to ignore your feelings. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=505.0s)]
*  I'm not sending Jamie a picture of your knee. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=508.0s)]
*  Oh, no, do it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=510.0s)]
*  I think Jamie has some... [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=511.0s)]
*  Do you have a picture of his knee, Jamie? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=513.0s)]
*  Did I ever send it to you, Jamie? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=515.0s)]
*  I have it here. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=518.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=519.0s)]
*  Let me just... [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=520.0s)]
*  But keep going. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=521.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=522.0s)]
*  So it's like for me, I made a decision. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=523.0s)]
*  I made a decision, and my decision was to be the best person I could. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=525.0s)]
*  And I basically, a lot of mornings, I wake up and say, fuck your feelings. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=530.0s)]
*  And that doesn't mean like, you know, don't take it literally, fuck your feelings. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=535.0s)]
*  But sometimes you have to go beyond what you're feeling. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=540.0s)]
*  And my knees were fucked, but guess what? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=543.0s)]
*  I wanted to run. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=545.0s)]
*  And I knew that, okay, you can get knee replacements, this and that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=546.0s)]
*  Like I said, it wasn't because I ran too much. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=549.0s)]
*  I was going to say, oh, man, you ran so much, so you fucked up your body. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=552.0s)]
*  You know, you don't want to be like David Goggins. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=555.0s)]
*  I hear it all the time. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=557.0s)]
*  You don't want to be like David Goggins. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=558.0s)]
*  So there's your knee. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=560.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=561.0s)]
*  First of all, look at the fact that there's zero space between those bones. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=562.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=567.0s)]
*  From the top, from your tibia to your femur, there's zero space. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=568.0s)]
*  It's just kneecap covering two bones that are rubbing against each other. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=573.0s)]
*  And so this was after surgery where they had to cut your knee, slice your shin like in half, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=579.0s)]
*  and then take a chunk out of it because it had deformed so much from you running with bone on bone [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=588.0s)]
*  that it was starting to like swell out in one direction. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=594.0s)]
*  It was changing the alignment of your leg. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=598.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=600.0s)]
*  This happened back in 2000. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=601.0s)]
*  2001 was going through buds. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=603.0s)]
*  So this happened for a long... [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=605.0s)]
*  This right here has been going on for a long time. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=607.0s)]
*  So it got to a point where it's like, OK, I'm done. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=610.0s)]
*  And that's the place that's in there right now. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=615.0s)]
*  So as you see the wedge, that part right there in the bone that's opened up, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=617.0s)]
*  so they had to cut it, realign it, and then now the alignment's better. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=621.0s)]
*  But this is now about 17 months ago, 17, 18 months ago when this happened. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=627.0s)]
*  So... [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=631.0s)]
*  Could they get some screws that fit? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=632.0s)]
*  Go back to that real quick. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=634.0s)]
*  What does real... [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=635.0s)]
*  That one sticks right out of the fucking bone. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=636.0s)]
*  Hey, cut that shit off. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=639.0s)]
*  Yeah, file that shit down. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=641.0s)]
*  Is that thing sticking in your leg? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=642.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=644.0s)]
*  Well, I feel the plate every single time I move. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=645.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=647.0s)]
*  So everything... [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=648.0s)]
*  Because it's like connected to the hamstring. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=649.0s)]
*  So whenever I fucking... [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=651.0s)]
*  Whenever I move, that plate is very irritating. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=653.0s)]
*  So every step, even like when I walk, when I run, it's this very irritating thing. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=657.0s)]
*  And then you gotta wait for so long for that leg to start getting back into place. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=662.0s)]
*  And if you see that other picture I sent of the foam, my foam leg that I put my hand in, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=666.0s)]
*  I think Jennifer sent it to you, Jamie, with the foam leg. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=674.0s)]
*  You'll see this in a second. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=676.0s)]
*  This is fucked up. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=678.0s)]
*  So like the swelling in that leg was fucking nuts. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=679.0s)]
*  Oh, when you had edema? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=682.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=683.0s)]
*  You showed it to me in Vegas. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=684.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=685.0s)]
*  You were sticking your thumb into your... [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=686.0s)]
*  I grabbed it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=689.0s)]
*  It was pretty nuts. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=690.0s)]
*  But once again, it's just things I was willing to endure to get... [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=691.0s)]
*  Yeah, I see it right there. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=697.0s)]
*  So that's just all post-surgery swelling. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=699.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=703.0s)]
*  So when the doctor said this to you and he said, look, this is how fucked up your knee is, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=704.0s)]
*  did he say you need a replacement? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=710.0s)]
*  What was he saying? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=712.0s)]
*  Basically, I had two options. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=713.0s)]
*  So I went to the first guy, had the surgery done. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=715.0s)]
*  That's in the book. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=717.0s)]
*  I talked about that. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=718.0s)]
*  But then the second guy, so after the first surgery, I was done. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=719.0s)]
*  So this is the first surgery after buds? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=722.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=724.0s)]
*  So this is like back in looking at 2000. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=725.0s)]
*  So me and Cameron, this is recently. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=729.0s)]
*  So I didn't have any surgery going through buds. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=731.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=734.0s)]
*  I didn't have any surgery at all. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=735.0s)]
*  So I went through in 2001, I fucked up. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=736.0s)]
*  2000, 2001, whatever it was, I messed up my leg real bad and hell we kept on going on it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=739.0s)]
*  Just kept on going. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=743.0s)]
*  What did you do to it and how we... [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=744.0s)]
*  It was like I fucked it up somehow, like running or whatever. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=746.0s)]
*  I have it in can't hurt me. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=750.0s)]
*  But it was, I think the boat, I fell, it twisted. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=751.0s)]
*  But over a period of time, it's got worse and worse and worse. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=756.0s)]
*  So I was getting like toward all shots every day. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=758.0s)]
*  And then this got worse. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=760.0s)]
*  But I'm like, fucking I'm good. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=762.0s)]
*  So I kept going on it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=763.0s)]
*  So it kind of healed all fucked up. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=764.0s)]
*  So this kept going, kept going, kept going. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=766.0s)]
*  Years later, years later, it kept going on it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=768.0s)]
*  So I stopped squatting. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=771.0s)]
*  So it became like, okay, my knees fucked up. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=773.0s)]
*  My alignment's messed up. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=775.0s)]
*  My hips are messed up. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=776.0s)]
*  I can't squat. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=777.0s)]
*  So I could still run. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=778.0s)]
*  So, okay, I started running. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=780.0s)]
*  Because running doesn't require you to bend down and shit. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=782.0s)]
*  So I'm running a lot. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=784.0s)]
*  And it got to 20 years later pretty much. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=786.0s)]
*  And it was 2020. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=789.0s)]
*  Or if I don't get this right, Cameron Haynes came down. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=791.0s)]
*  We went for a 20 mile run. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=795.0s)]
*  My knees were fucked up for like 10 years. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=797.0s)]
*  Long story short, it was like, okay, man, I got to get this thing looked at. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=799.0s)]
*  So when I got looked at, the doc was like, oh, we can go in there and just do a quick little fucking clean up job. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=803.0s)]
*  And the clean up job went so quick. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=810.0s)]
*  The guy was breaking tools and shit. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=812.0s)]
*  Fucking up, like literally broke tools. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=814.0s)]
*  And I have it in there. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=817.0s)]
*  He was breaking tools. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=818.0s)]
*  I talked to him. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=819.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=820.0s)]
*  He told me your meniscus was the hardest meniscus he's ever experienced in his life. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=821.0s)]
*  He's like, dude, he goes, I didn't know that meniscus could get that way. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=825.0s)]
*  He goes, like, he's not human. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=830.0s)]
*  He goes, when I was cutting into meniscus, it broke the scalpel. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=832.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=835.0s)]
*  Wills Lawson, Joe Meeseve. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=836.0s)]
*  Wills Law something. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=837.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=838.0s)]
*  He said, normally when you cut into meniscus, it just slices right through like butter. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=839.0s)]
*  He's like, I couldn't cut it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=844.0s)]
*  Yeah, mine went butter. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=846.0s)]
*  Mine went butter. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=847.0s)]
*  So all those motherfuckers who think I'm putting them 100 mile weeks, go fuck yourself, bitch. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=848.0s)]
*  You don't get no shit like that, babe. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=852.0s)]
*  I sent them the fucking couch. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=854.0s)]
*  No, I mean, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=855.0s)]
*  Like you've hardened your meniscus just through constant pressure and pounding. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=858.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=862.0s)]
*  So he went in there to clean it up. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=863.0s)]
*  And then what happened? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=864.0s)]
*  So basically that little meniscus, that whatever the fuck was in there. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=865.0s)]
*  So my alignment was so bad. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=869.0s)]
*  The only thing that was keeping me able to do anything was that little fucked up, messed up meniscus. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=871.0s)]
*  It was all jarred up and jacked up. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=880.0s)]
*  But the second that thing got out, dude, it was like I was. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=882.0s)]
*  Have you seen Star Wars, those storm things, those big fucking things that, what are they called? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=887.0s)]
*  They have wobbly legs and they hit like logs. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=895.0s)]
*  The robot things. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=897.0s)]
*  Yeah, the robot things. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=898.0s)]
*  That's how my leg was. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=899.0s)]
*  It had nothing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=901.0s)]
*  It was just like a little dangling fucking like so from my knee down, the shin, the tip fib, it just dangled. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=902.0s)]
*  Like there was nothing. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=910.0s)]
*  And I was like, OK, man, this is fucked up. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=912.0s)]
*  So it was worse after the cleanup. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=914.0s)]
*  Much worse. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=916.0s)]
*  Like I was done. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=917.0s)]
*  I went from running 200 miles to I did 240 mile race in 2020, October 2020. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=918.0s)]
*  It was Moab. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=925.0s)]
*  Went out there, got second place, 62 hours. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=926.0s)]
*  Knee was fucked up, getting it drained before the fucking race. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=929.0s)]
*  But I still ran 240 miles. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=932.0s)]
*  Literally five or six days before the race, I'm getting it drained. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=933.0s)]
*  And it was a baseball sized fucking, it's called a Baker's Assist. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=937.0s)]
*  So they drained it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=942.0s)]
*  And I went in there, did the race. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=943.0s)]
*  Finished it. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=945.0s)]
*  And I was like, OK, here we go. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=946.0s)]
*  Went on to do some more races. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=947.0s)]
*  I did like another 200 mile. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=949.0s)]
*  Did a couple more races. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=950.0s)]
*  And then, like I said, the cam came down. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=951.0s)]
*  Right after that, I went and got this surgery done. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=953.0s)]
*  And I went from running every day to now I have some fucking legs that just dangles. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=955.0s)]
*  And after that surgery, this fucking dangles. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=960.0s)]
*  And I was like, OK, man, I'm fucked. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=963.0s)]
*  And it's just from that little piece of meniscus. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=965.0s)]
*  Just that little piece of meniscus. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=967.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking, OK, man, this is not, this doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=968.0s)]
*  This is something fucked. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=972.0s)]
*  There's something fucked. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=973.0s)]
*  I don't understand why I can't, I can't put any pressure on my leg. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=974.0s)]
*  The amount of blood they were taking out was unbelievable. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=977.0s)]
*  So there's the blood right there. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=981.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=982.0s)]
*  That's the blood, dude. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=983.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=984.0s)]
*  There's one, two, three, four, five, six. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=985.0s)]
*  And you see the black blood? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=987.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=988.0s)]
*  That is deoxygenated blood. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=989.0s)]
*  So whatever was going on, whatever the fuck was going on. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=991.0s)]
*  That's why it looks different color. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=995.0s)]
*  So the red blood is the blood that has oxygen. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=996.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=999.0s)]
*  And that was just like coagulated. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1000.0s)]
*  Just fucked up blood. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1001.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1003.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1004.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1005.0s)]
*  So that, so after surgery, I'm like, I'm like seven, seven days out of whatever the fuck [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1006.0s)]
*  it was. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1009.0s)]
*  It once again, I don't know the exact times, but I have them in the book. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1010.0s)]
*  I have everything fucking dialed in. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1014.0s)]
*  I went back and I was like, man, I'm fucked up. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1017.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a simple meniscus surgery, man. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1019.0s)]
*  Like people go back a week later. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1021.0s)]
*  They're playing two weeks, three weeks tops. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1023.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, I'm never going to fucking run again. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1025.0s)]
*  I'm going to walk with a fucking limp. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1028.0s)]
*  So I'm going back. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1029.0s)]
*  I'm getting fucking like, I'm literally getting my knee drained every week, getting PRP. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1030.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, but in the back of my mind, I know how far I can push myself. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1034.0s)]
*  I know my body so fucking well, so well. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1039.0s)]
*  And I'm like, this is, this is wrong. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1042.0s)]
*  I'm never going to run again. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1046.0s)]
*  I'm never going to run again. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1048.0s)]
*  I walk with a limp. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1050.0s)]
*  So this went off about six, six months. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1051.0s)]
*  So I had the surgery done in February. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1053.0s)]
*  February is February, March, April, May, June, about four months, four months after surgery, four or five months. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1056.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey, Jennifer, I got to find somebody else to look at my fucking knee. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1065.0s)]
*  So I try to keep my shit together. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1071.0s)]
*  But imagine when you go from every day of your fucking life grinding and you go to nothing. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1072.0s)]
*  Like literally like 90 minute surgery done. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1078.0s)]
*  That's crazy that it was just a little meniscus scope. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1082.0s)]
*  90 minute surgery done. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1084.0s)]
*  And I was like, OK, man, this is anyway. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1087.0s)]
*  So I found this guy named Dr. Gamal out of New York. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1090.0s)]
*  And we fly there. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1094.0s)]
*  But I'm like, he can't fix this, man, because I knew it was a lot more than knees. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1095.0s)]
*  It was just it was all kind of this fucked up body shit. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1099.0s)]
*  And I walk in the office and he decides to see me and me and Jennifer and Jennifer's happy. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1103.0s)]
*  She's happy as shit. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1109.0s)]
*  She's like, oh, my God, man, this guy's going to be able to get you a fucking meniscus replacement. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1110.0s)]
*  He was all kind of gurued out. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1115.0s)]
*  But I'm a realist, bro. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1118.0s)]
*  I will push myself and I'll go as far as I can. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1120.0s)]
*  But I also am a realist. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1123.0s)]
*  I also knew the back of my mind. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1125.0s)]
*  I'm not going to try to ruin your fucking party, Jennifer. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1126.0s)]
*  This is what I'm saying myself. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1128.0s)]
*  But this is done. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1130.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1131.0s)]
*  So I went just to pretty much appease her and just see if there's anything left. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1132.0s)]
*  So I walk in the office and the doctor's like, yeah, I'm looking at your x-rays. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1138.0s)]
*  And that's the doctor who was like, I don't know how this is when the doctor good. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1142.0s)]
*  I'll look him up. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1146.0s)]
*  World renowned motherfucker, dude. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1147.0s)]
*  And when this guy looked at me straight faced, he said, man, I don't know how you did anything with those knees. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1149.0s)]
*  Anything, let alone run 200 miles back to back 240 miles where the fuck you did. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1157.0s)]
*  I don't know how you did it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1162.0s)]
*  And so I'm like, OK, whatever. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1164.0s)]
*  Can we get it fixed? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1166.0s)]
*  And he didn't want to get there because he knew I was fucked. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1168.0s)]
*  He's like, no, you know, we can maybe try and unload a brace. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1170.0s)]
*  Maybe an unloader brace will help you out. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1176.0s)]
*  What's an unloader brace? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1178.0s)]
*  So basically my knee went in on the meniscus side on the inside. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1179.0s)]
*  So it was like jamming on the inside. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1183.0s)]
*  So this brace kind of like it kind of helps realign the knee a little bit so then you cannot have so much pressure on the inside your leg. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1185.0s)]
*  So that's it right there. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1193.0s)]
*  So on one side. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1194.0s)]
*  Yeah. So basically I'm like, man, I'm like, OK, I'm not. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1195.0s)]
*  So this is all you have for me. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1199.0s)]
*  I'm like, you can't do shit for me. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1201.0s)]
*  And he was like, no. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1203.0s)]
*  And he was walking out of the office and he could tell. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1206.0s)]
*  I was like, I wasn't too fucked up. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1208.0s)]
*  But I was like because I kind of was preparing myself for the next part of my journey. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1211.0s)]
*  I don't like to lay in my shit too long. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1215.0s)]
*  And I give myself a couple of minutes. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1217.0s)]
*  OK, motherfucker, we got a man to fuck up. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1219.0s)]
*  We got to get back in this fucking like what's next? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1221.0s)]
*  You know, let's go. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1223.0s)]
*  Let's go see. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1224.0s)]
*  You know, let's go back to college. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1225.0s)]
*  Let's do something because you're running in your athletic career is done. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1226.0s)]
*  So he got to the door. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1230.0s)]
*  You opened it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1232.0s)]
*  And as he was literally he was shouldered out the motherfucking door. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1233.0s)]
*  And I'm looking at Jennifer like, well, you know, we'll go back to fucking go back to Nevada and fucking start again. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1237.0s)]
*  And he was like, try the unloader brace out. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1244.0s)]
*  And there's one more thing we could possibly do for you. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1248.0s)]
*  I'm like, motherfucker, like, get your little monkey fucking ass back in here. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1252.0s)]
*  Well, like, what is it? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1256.0s)]
*  Like, like, what the fuck's going on? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1258.0s)]
*  So he was like, yeah, there's this surgery called HTO. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1260.0s)]
*  He was like, you can go in. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1264.0s)]
*  We can fucking, you know, pretty much break your tibia. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1266.0s)]
*  It's called high tibia osteotomy. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1269.0s)]
*  They go in and they break your tibia. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1271.0s)]
*  They slice into it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1274.0s)]
*  And they wedge it to the point where they realign your leg back up. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1277.0s)]
*  It's a very painful surgery. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1282.0s)]
*  It's very painful afterwards. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1284.0s)]
*  Painful as fuck afterwards. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1285.0s)]
*  And they put that plate, the plate you saw back on. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1287.0s)]
*  And then your leg is so. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1291.0s)]
*  So your knee is still where it was because this doesn't get fixed. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1293.0s)]
*  So it takes several months for that knee to start working that way back into where the alignment is. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1297.0s)]
*  So now my leg is just now. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1303.0s)]
*  So here it is. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1304.0s)]
*  So here we can see it on the image. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1305.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1306.0s)]
*  So they take a slice out of it because it's deformed. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1307.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1311.0s)]
*  And that slice lowers the part that's deformed and tries to make it a more natural shape. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1312.0s)]
*  But you're still dealing with bone on bone. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1318.0s)]
*  So you're still dealing with the pain of arthritis, essentially. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1322.0s)]
*  Do you have any cartilage in your knees? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1327.0s)]
*  Not much. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1329.0s)]
*  Not much at all, if any. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1330.0s)]
*  So the thing about it, it takes that pressure off of that. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1332.0s)]
*  So it was complete bone on bone. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1336.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1338.0s)]
*  What that surgery does is it takes it over to the lateral side. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1339.0s)]
*  So on the outside. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1342.0s)]
*  So I have a nice meniscus over there. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1343.0s)]
*  That thing wasn't touched for years because how I was born, all the pressure was on my medial meniscus. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1345.0s)]
*  So your knee had been misaligned your whole life? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1353.0s)]
*  My whole life. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1355.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1356.0s)]
*  My whole life has been fucked up. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1357.0s)]
*  So my meniscus on my lateral side is pristine. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1358.0s)]
*  So now the way he did it is that all of my pressure is going on to that pristine meniscus. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1363.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1369.0s)]
*  So now it's all about getting that leg back aligned, which has taken forever. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1370.0s)]
*  And it's still not aligned? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1375.0s)]
*  It's getting there. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1376.0s)]
*  It's getting there. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1377.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting there. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1378.0s)]
*  Can they do a meniscus replacement on you? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1379.0s)]
*  No. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1382.0s)]
*  So that's what I wanted to get done. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1383.0s)]
*  But if your knee is so far gone, like mine was, there was no option for that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1385.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1390.0s)]
*  Because my knee was so far gone. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1391.0s)]
*  So it was like, when you put that meniscus in there, however it works, he said, it wouldn't have taken it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1392.0s)]
*  Like basically, yeah, we would have taken it, but we would have fucking destroyed it because your leg is so your knee is so fucked up. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1397.0s)]
*  So this was the only option for me. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1401.0s)]
*  Don't they make like an artificial meniscus now as well? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1403.0s)]
*  Yep. And this is what this guy really specializes in. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1407.0s)]
*  So he's like the guy to go to for that stuff. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1410.0s)]
*  What does an artificial meniscus consist of? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1413.0s)]
*  I guess it's just, I have no idea. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1415.0s)]
*  I'm not even going to get into that shit. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1417.0s)]
*  See if we can find out what that is. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1418.0s)]
*  Because I got some fucked up knees too. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1420.0s)]
*  Not like yours though. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1422.0s)]
*  If I ever think about complaining, I look at yours. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1424.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1426.0s)]
*  See, you're world's first artificial meniscus available in Israel. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1427.0s)]
*  And there you go, Andreas Gamal. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1430.0s)]
*  Yeah, there he is. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1432.0s)]
*  And so this, it looks like some sort of a clear gel looking stuff. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1434.0s)]
*  And which is, you know, the meniscus is just a cushioning in between the two bones and the cartilage. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1439.0s)]
*  And this is, oh, look at that. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1445.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1447.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1449.0s)]
*  But they can't do that to you? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1451.0s)]
*  No, you have to be a good candidate for that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1453.0s)]
*  So your knee has to be in a certain condition. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1455.0s)]
*  And mine was not in that condition. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1458.0s)]
*  It was fucked up. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1460.0s)]
*  If you were a candidate for that, would they be able to do it and you'd be able to run? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1461.0s)]
*  Or is that just like to move around and walk? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1465.0s)]
*  From what I read about, you can run, you can do everything you want to do. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1467.0s)]
*  But sometimes if you do a lot, it wears it out. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1470.0s)]
*  Hmm. But you can get a new one. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1473.0s)]
*  Get a new one. Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1475.0s)]
*  Well, that's not that bad. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1476.0s)]
*  Not that bad, man. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1477.0s)]
*  For you, it doesn't work. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1478.0s)]
*  No, because basically it wouldn't even work for me because my knee was gone. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1479.0s)]
*  But the way he reshaped it, wouldn't that correct? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1484.0s)]
*  I mean, he kind of like changed your alignment of your knee and made it more normal, right? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1487.0s)]
*  I think he made it more normal. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1493.0s)]
*  But from what I understand, if you put that in there, structurally, like structure wise, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1495.0s)]
*  what makes it more normal is the surgery he did. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1501.0s)]
*  So right now there's no bone on bone for me. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1503.0s)]
*  So there's no need for that meniscus at all. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1507.0s)]
*  So a lot of people get their meniscus taken out if you have the right alignment and your body can do what it's supposed to do. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1509.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1515.0s)]
*  But if you get your meniscus taken out, you're just cartilage on cartilage? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1516.0s)]
*  If you know Dwayne Wade, Dwayne, basketball player, I believe Dwayne Wade played years, years, if I'm correct, with no meniscus. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1519.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1529.0s)]
*  I think in both his knees. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1530.0s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1532.0s)]
*  Years. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1533.0s)]
*  He ended up having like really bad knee problems, but his meniscus was messed up. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1534.0s)]
*  Back in the day, they used to take it out. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1538.0s)]
*  So if you look here, here it is. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1540.0s)]
*  I got it when I was in college. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1542.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1544.0s)]
*  Surgery to remove the meniscus in his left knee 11 years ago while he was at Marquette led to ongoing knee problems he's had with Miami Heat. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1545.0s)]
*  I'm so glad that you have this fucking thing to pull up, Jamie, because I would be talking out my ass half the damn time. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1553.0s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1558.0s)]
*  Man, you fucking square me away, bro. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1559.0s)]
*  Knees are a problem, man. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1562.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1564.0s)]
*  And the fact that you require your knees to do what you do, like your whole thing is endurance athlete. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1565.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1573.0s)]
*  And to be an endurance athlete, you got to be able to move your legs. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1574.0s)]
*  You got to be able to move them. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1576.0s)]
*  But what I like about, and this was like literally a trained skill for me, was I'm always preparing for like not being a bitch. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1578.0s)]
*  Like a lot of people get to a point, like for instance, like if Jennifer can't do something, like if she can't go for a run or whatever, just like because something's wrong, like some simple shit, it's going to bother her. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1589.0s)]
*  And I got to a point in my life where I realized this is life. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1602.0s)]
*  And so I move on past things real quick. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1605.0s)]
*  So people are like, oh my God, what are you going to do, David, if you can't run? [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1607.0s)]
*  Motherfucker, I'll swim. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1611.0s)]
*  Or I'll go to college or I'll do something else. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1613.0s)]
*  Like this isn't my life. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1615.0s)]
*  So I'm very aware how quick life can take shit from you. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1618.0s)]
*  And I've always prepared my mind for the next chapter. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1623.0s)]
*  And what happened with me was I started this thing called front loading. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1628.0s)]
*  So when I was young, I used to be a little piece of shit, you know, like fucking, oh, I'm not good enough. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1631.0s)]
*  I can't do this. I can't do that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1635.0s)]
*  But the second I got my head out of my ass and I realized, man, you can achieve a lot of shit if you get off your ass and you start moving and you start motivating yourself, start becoming a self motivator. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1637.0s)]
*  So I started front loading. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1648.0s)]
*  And front loading is people, you know, you've done so much by 47 because I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring me. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1650.0s)]
*  So my military resume is fat. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1656.0s)]
*  You know, I fucking did a lot in the military. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1659.0s)]
*  I did a lot outside the military. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1661.0s)]
*  I've I've I've made money. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1663.0s)]
*  I've I've done almost every race out there. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1665.0s)]
*  Hard race in the world. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1667.0s)]
*  I've broken pull up records. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1668.0s)]
*  I've done a lot of shit. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1670.0s)]
*  So when these bad times come and also not like that, like work your ass off so you can enjoy. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1671.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're taking a shot. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1677.0s)]
*  You know, you you may not live to be old, but what if you do and you worked your ass off when you were able and you were able to fucking get up early, able to grind? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1678.0s)]
*  If you front loaded properly, the back half of your fucking life is money. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1688.0s)]
*  And that's what I did. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1693.0s)]
*  The second I realized that, man, you are a piece of shit. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1694.0s)]
*  We got to get going because at 47, man, you're not going to do any of this shit. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1697.0s)]
*  50, whatever you are. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1702.0s)]
*  So I front loaded. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1703.0s)]
*  So all these bad things have happened to me. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1704.0s)]
*  I sit back with me. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1707.0s)]
*  How are you handling so well? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1708.0s)]
*  Well, fuck off. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1710.0s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1711.0s)]
*  I front loaded. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1712.0s)]
*  I have the money I need to have the success I need. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1713.0s)]
*  I have the fucking determination, the willpower and also the pride in myself. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1715.0s)]
*  So when I wake up every morning, I know who the fuck I am. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1719.0s)]
*  I front loaded perfectly. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1722.0s)]
*  So I don't care what's taken from me. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1724.0s)]
*  But it's got to still it's got to be a strange position to be in where your body is your medium. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1726.0s)]
*  The body is the vehicle for you to express yourself. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1733.0s)]
*  Right. And your body's breaking down. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1736.0s)]
*  And I know that they consider doing knee replacements on you. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1738.0s)]
*  And what was that conversation like? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1742.0s)]
*  It was it was very basic. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1744.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, you know, you're not going to be able to do some of the shit that you've done, even though obviously people are. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1745.0s)]
*  But that was a conversation. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1750.0s)]
*  And I know it sounds weird. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1752.0s)]
*  It was totally fine with me. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1754.0s)]
*  It was fine because I had, dude, people understand this. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1756.0s)]
*  This wasn't like a part time job, man. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1760.0s)]
*  When you've done what I like, Kobe Bryant, Kobe fucking retired at last game. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1763.0s)]
*  He like 60 points or some shit. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1768.0s)]
*  He walked off the court. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1770.0s)]
*  He didn't cry. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1772.0s)]
*  He said, oh, I'm going to miss the sport. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1773.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1775.0s)]
*  He walked off. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1776.0s)]
*  He gave he gave everything he could. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1777.0s)]
*  Man, when you fucking give what I've given and motherfuckers like to sell you. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1779.0s)]
*  Fuck you. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1783.0s)]
*  You don't fucking know shit. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1784.0s)]
*  Which makes me who I am. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1786.0s)]
*  I've given everything people make. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1788.0s)]
*  Oh, you ran on fucked up knees. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1790.0s)]
*  You taped your feet up. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1792.0s)]
*  You did blah, blah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1793.0s)]
*  You had two heart surgeries. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1794.0s)]
*  You kept on going. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1795.0s)]

*  I had some of the fucking going. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1800.0s)]
*  I got there. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1802.0s)]
*  And buddy, when motherfuckers tell you, you can take a break now. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1803.0s)]
*  Hey, you fucked up. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1806.0s)]
*  As long as my knees are halfway where I got to run. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1808.0s)]
*  You're telling me maybe a chance. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1811.0s)]
*  I can't run no more. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1813.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1814.0s)]
*  Give me an excuse to fucking not do shit. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1815.0s)]
*  But as long as I have no excuse, I got to do it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1817.0s)]
*  But I was I was I was happy where I was. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1819.0s)]

*  Don't believe it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1827.0s)]
*  I gave everything. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1828.0s)]
*  And when you get everything, you have no regret. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1829.0s)]
*  People didn't understand me. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1832.0s)]
*  People don't understand me now. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1833.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1834.0s)]
*  I know exactly what I was doing. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1836.0s)]
*  I'm not a masochist. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1838.0s)]
*  I'm not crazy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1839.0s)]
*  I'm not this and that. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1840.0s)]
*  People try to title me and label me. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1841.0s)]
*  No, I had something to fucking do. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1843.0s)]
*  Well, the way I describe it to people when people ask me, like, why does he do all these things? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1846.0s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1850.0s)]
*  What is the motivation here? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1851.0s)]
*  I go, he's on a mental journey that very few people have ever been on because the people don't understand you or they misunderstand you or they purposely misinterpret the way you're living your life. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1852.0s)]
*  You're trying to understand your mind in a way that very few human beings ever get to understand their mind, because you're taking your mind into these terrible, terrible, terrible places. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1867.0s)]
*  You're taking your mind into these terrible, dark places all the time. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1881.0s)]
*  And you're trying to pull things out of that. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1885.0s)]
*  You're trying to learn things about yourself and about your potential from that. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1887.0s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1892.0s)]
*  And that's what people don't understand. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1893.0s)]
*  I studied the darkness. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1894.0s)]
*  You find no fucking answers in the light. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1896.0s)]
*  None. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1900.0s)]
*  It's too happy. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1901.0s)]
*  It's too nice. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1902.0s)]
*  And we're not running to be taught how to live in happiness. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1903.0s)]
*  That just comes naturally to us. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1906.0s)]
*  Happy moments. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1908.0s)]
*  But the dark times, man, you can't and you can't get there unless you put yourself there. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1909.0s)]
*  Life will take you there. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1913.0s)]
*  But when you get into those dark moments, that's what people that's what people are. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1915.0s)]
*  How are you able to I couldn't fucking read and write to I was a junior in high school. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1918.0s)]

*  I go to such places in my mind and I study the darkness like it's not just physical. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1927.0s)]
*  When I was growing up and I saw my mom getting beat and I got beat and I was some stuttering little black kid in all white school and I'm on stage and I got to say one line, one fucking line in front of fucking 15 people. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1933.0s)]

*  The only way we're going to fucking get through this if you study it. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1960.0s)]
*  So every time I'm in a dark moment and life's fucked up around me, whether it be physical or just life, I get in it, man, with a fucking pen and paper. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1962.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, this fucking sucks. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1971.0s)]
*  I can feel like I'm fucking losing my ship. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=1973.0s)]

*  I cannot help people. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2003.0s)]
*  There's a lot of cookie cutter shit out here in this world. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2004.0s)]
*  Oh, discipline. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2007.0s)]
*  Wake up early. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2009.0s)]
*  Take a cold shower. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2010.0s)]
*  Fuck this. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2011.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2012.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2013.0s)]
*  It's all fucking bullshit. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2014.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2015.0s)]
*  But what they don't teach you within the cookie cutter is like our minds are like a fucking garage and the garage. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2017.0s)]
*  If you open a garage, it's all cluttered up. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2026.0s)]
*  It's all fucked up. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2028.0s)]
*  You can't put your car in there. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2029.0s)]
*  You got fucking boats and you got fucking kids toys and shit everywhere. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2030.0s)]
*  But if you organize that fucking garage and you put everything is rightful spot, you can pull that car in there. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2034.0s)]
*  You put two cars and you put bikes in there. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2040.0s)]
*  And that's like with the mind. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2042.0s)]
*  People talk about discipline and fucking determination and fucking repetitions and all this shit consistency. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2044.0s)]
*  Why people fall off the wagon so often is because their mind is full of shit. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2052.0s)]
*  There's no room in that mind for discipline. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2058.0s)]
*  There's no room for consistency. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2061.0s)]
*  They may do it once or twice, but then the mind takes over and that cluttered fucking garage comes in. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2063.0s)]
*  And then it's like a circuit breaker, man. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2069.0s)]
*  A circuit breaker just overloads and fucking sparks in our minds. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2071.0s)]
*  That's our mind, man. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2075.0s)]
*  It's like a fucking circuit breaker. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2076.0s)]
*  That's so much shit in it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2077.0s)]
*  You keep unloading it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2078.0s)]
*  You can't put any more into it. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2079.0s)]
*  So I talk about it in there, man, so much about clearing space in your fucking mind. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2082.0s)]
*  So then you have room for all those discipline. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2088.0s)]
*  Waking up early, taking those because they do mean something. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2092.0s)]
*  But we don't get to that fucking dark matter that is keeping you from clearing out that mental garage. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2096.0s)]
*  That's a good way to put it because that is the mind of most people is filled with stuff that they have to move around to get to what they want. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2102.0s)]
*  And it's constantly piling up and shit unorganized and organized mind, man. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2112.0s)]
*  You look at fucking I got to take care of the kids. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2118.0s)]
*  The kids scales is all fucked up. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2120.0s)]
*  My husband, my wife. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2121.0s)]
*  I'm going by McDonald's to get this and I'm rushing my schedule. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2123.0s)]
*  Everything is just fucked. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2128.0s)]
*  I wish I was doing this, but I'm doing that and that and this. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2129.0s)]
*  I want a raise, but I can't get one. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2132.0s)]
*  My boss is an asshole. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2134.0s)]
*  Where's greatness in that, man? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2136.0s)]
*  You can't fit discipline into that. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2137.0s)]
*  You can't fit structure. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2140.0s)]
*  You can't fit consistency. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2141.0s)]
*  You can't fit the grind. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2143.0s)]
*  And then when you try, it just gets fucking it gets fucking overrun by the fucking clutter and you're fucked up. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2144.0s)]
*  Mental garage. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2152.0s)]
*  When you are in these dark places and you're gathering up these lessons, how difficult is it to try to bring that back and convey it to people when you're not in that space? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2153.0s)]
*  Like when you're in that space, when you're in the Moab 240 and you're going uphill and you're in the middle of the grave, it's just deep suck. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2168.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2176.0s)]
*  How do you convey where that mental fortitude comes from? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2177.0s)]
*  How do you bring that back? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2181.0s)]
*  It's almost like you've got something you can't even hold in your hand. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2183.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2186.0s)]
*  And you want to show it to people. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2187.0s)]
*  I take snapshots. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2188.0s)]
*  So every time I'm in a bad situation, I study it. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2190.0s)]
*  And that's the only reason I do have to should I do is I'm studying this shit because I know that I never thought I was going to be writing books and trying to help people get better. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2194.0s)]
*  But I was always trying to do it because I knew I sucked. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2204.0s)]
*  And so when you know you're trying to get somewhere, you know, you suck, you know that you you believe that you're born loser. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2208.0s)]
*  You are taking snapshots, man. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2214.0s)]
*  Like, you know, you you see something on your phone like, oh, man, I want to take a fucking snapshot of that. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2216.0s)]
*  Or how we do the little picture shit so you can save it on your phone. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2223.0s)]
*  I do that in my mind. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2226.0s)]
*  So I get in these moments from like fucking. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2227.0s)]
*  OK, wow, that's some fucking good knowledge right there, man. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2229.0s)]
*  I snapshot it because I know that I can use that later. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2232.0s)]
*  I can I can I can use it because I'm not out there. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2236.0s)]
*  Just I'm not most people. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2238.0s)]
*  They go out and they run and they go out and they do. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2240.0s)]
*  And they're like, oh, this is beautiful. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2243.0s)]
*  Look at the fucking mountains and the shit and all this bullshit. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2244.0s)]
*  No, I don't like it. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2247.0s)]
*  My body hurts. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2249.0s)]
*  I'm hurting. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2250.0s)]
*  How do we get through this? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2251.0s)]
*  And it's a fucking it's a it's a it's a lab. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2252.0s)]
*  It's my mental lab. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2256.0s)]
*  And so when I come home, I'm not forgetting it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2258.0s)]
*  And the second I get every day, I get done running or every day I get to work and every day I get to study. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2261.0s)]
*  Whatever it is that brings me to that place of knowledge, I come home and that book was mostly written on a scratch piece of paper at hand. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2265.0s)]
*  So I come home from from running and I write everything out. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2274.0s)]
*  I write everything out, all those things. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2277.0s)]
*  And as I'm running, I'm talking about it. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2280.0s)]
*  So all these things that pop my head as I continue to run, I'm going through it. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2283.0s)]
*  I'm starting to layer it down. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2287.0s)]
*  I'm starting to break it down into OK, that happened. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2289.0s)]
*  OK, now, now let's layer this because that's just not how it happened. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2292.0s)]
*  This didn't happen that way. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2296.0s)]
*  What led up to this? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2297.0s)]
*  And so it becomes me by myself in school. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2299.0s)]
*  I'm literally going to school right now and I'm learning. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2302.0s)]
*  So I come home, I write it out and then I'm able to write out and I'm able to think about it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2305.0s)]
*  OK, oh, this is good shit. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2309.0s)]
*  This is this will help me later on. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2311.0s)]
*  And then it becomes what it is now. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2314.0s)]
*  And when you try to convey it to people, what do you when you're writing it out and when you're talking about it, what do you thinking? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2317.0s)]
*  Are you thinking that this is going to get into someone's mind and this is going to help them motivate themselves? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2326.0s)]
*  Are you just trying to express yourself and let them do with it what they can? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2330.0s)]
*  I'm them. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2335.0s)]
*  You're them. I'm them. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2337.0s)]
*  I and this fucked up thing about me, why I'm able to do it the way I'm able to do it. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2339.0s)]
*  I'm not above them. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2343.0s)]
*  I was never above them. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2345.0s)]
*  A lot of people write where they are. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2346.0s)]
*  They write where they are. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2349.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like fucking you right now writing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2351.0s)]
*  You have a good life, man. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2354.0s)]
*  You have a fucking good life. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2356.0s)]
*  I don't write from that place. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2358.0s)]
*  I write from the place that I am, the place that created who I am. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2360.0s)]
*  I go back to that place. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2364.0s)]
*  I call it going back to scratch. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2366.0s)]
*  I can't write about David Goggins. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2368.0s)]
*  Now, David Goggins now is a success. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2370.0s)]
*  People want to get to be to feel whatever success is for them. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2372.0s)]
*  They want to feel that. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2377.0s)]
*  So I can't write it here at David Goggins successful. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2378.0s)]
*  I must write at David Goggins. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2382.0s)]
*  Fucking man, I'm a fucking I don't feel good about myself. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2383.0s)]
*  And every day I go through that journey. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2388.0s)]
*  So that's where it comes from. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2390.0s)]
*  It comes from scratch. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2391.0s)]
*  All that shit, all my knowledge comes from going back to where the real growth, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2393.0s)]
*  growth doesn't happen when you make it so far in life, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2398.0s)]
*  you make it so high up, whatever it is, whatever you're trying to be. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2401.0s)]
*  There's no more growth. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2405.0s)]
*  There's small growth. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2406.0s)]
*  But you remember back when you fucking try to become Joe Rogan you are now. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2408.0s)]
*  How much growth was in that? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2413.0s)]
*  Tons of growth, learning lessons learned. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2415.0s)]
*  So I go, I always revit. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2417.0s)]
*  That's why I'm a fucking wildland firefighter now. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2419.0s)]
*  Why am I fucking smoke jumper? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2422.0s)]
*  I don't need to do that shit at all. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2424.0s)]
*  But I don't learn anything from where I'm at now. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2426.0s)]
*  There's no knowledge up here. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2429.0s)]
*  The knowledge is down there in the fucking muck. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2430.0s)]
*  So that's where I write. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2433.0s)]
*  That's where I go back. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2434.0s)]
*  That's where I learn. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2435.0s)]
*  I always go back to school. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2436.0s)]
*  I always go back to the basics. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2437.0s)]
*  I always go back to first grade. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2439.0s)]
*  And how much of that is tied to doing things physically though? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2442.0s)]
*  There's a certain kind of physical struggle that you go through, particularly with what you excel at, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2447.0s)]
*  which is endurance athlete work. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2453.0s)]
*  There's a mental and physical thing that happens when the two of them are together. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2455.0s)]
*  It doesn't happen in anything else. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2462.0s)]
*  You can do hard work, hard mental work, and it's very difficult. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2464.0s)]
*  And I'm sure you can learn a lot from that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2468.0s)]
*  But it doesn't have the physical pain that comes with the suck of endurance work. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2470.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2477.0s)]
*  There's nothing in the world that you're able... [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2478.0s)]
*  Let's say that Moab 240 I was in, 62 hours. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2482.0s)]
*  Fucking sucked. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2487.0s)]
*  With blown out knees. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2490.0s)]
*  Blown out knees. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2492.0s)]
*  Literally a few days before the race, I'm getting drained. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2493.0s)]
*  Before the race. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2498.0s)]
*  So that's in your fucking mind, man. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2499.0s)]
*  It ain't like, oh, I show up to start line. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2502.0s)]
*  Oh, this is fucking great. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2504.0s)]
*  I'm going to fucking have a good time out here. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2505.0s)]
*  No, I'm thinking, all right, I just have my fucking knees drained. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2507.0s)]
*  Like I'm in pain at mile zero. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2510.0s)]
*  And that's in your brain. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2513.0s)]
*  I have 240 miles of fucking head of me. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2515.0s)]
*  And there's nothing in life. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2518.0s)]
*  Nothing in life. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2519.0s)]
*  This is why I love endurance sports so much. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2521.0s)]
*  I love it and I hate it. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2523.0s)]
*  It's a love-hate relationship. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2524.0s)]
*  62 hours, I equate that to fucking seven years of life. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2526.0s)]
*  You can't get that, man. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2533.0s)]
*  So what I know that Ultra does for me is it packs in. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2535.0s)]
*  It packs in. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2539.0s)]
*  I can't live several lifetimes. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2541.0s)]
*  I can't. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2544.0s)]
*  Because the knowledge I need to gain for this life I live in today, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2546.0s)]
*  I need two or three or four lifetimes to be where I want to go. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2549.0s)]
*  Ultra gives it to me in fucking high definition real fast. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2553.0s)]
*  62 hours you go out there and fucking suffer. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2558.0s)]
*  You come back, oh, that was 62 hours I gained seven fucking years of knowledge. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2561.0s)]
*  The ups and downs, the pain, the suffering, the... [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2567.0s)]
*  You learn how to chunk the shit down like, oh my God, man, I'm at mile 100. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2570.0s)]
*  How the fuck am I going to get to mile 118? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2575.0s)]
*  Everything becomes... [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2579.0s)]
*  You start to learn life out there and you learn so much in such a condensed period of time [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2581.0s)]
*  and nothing in the world can do it like pushing yourself to the absolute limit. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2586.0s)]
*  I call it like... [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2592.0s)]
*  So people have talent. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2594.0s)]
*  People have a lot of talent. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2597.0s)]
*  And this is going beyond your talent. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2600.0s)]
*  So when talent... [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2603.0s)]
*  When there's no more talent, what happens to you? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2605.0s)]
*  Most people quit. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2608.0s)]
*  People only go to their talent level. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2610.0s)]
*  And once your talent level is gone, it becomes a mental game. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2613.0s)]
*  That the whole mental game sets in then. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2617.0s)]
*  And most people can only perform to their talent. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2620.0s)]
*  And they realize, man, why am I always messing up right here? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2622.0s)]
*  Why is this like my big hurdle? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2626.0s)]
*  It's because you're performing to your talent. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2632.0s)]
*  And then after that, your mind has nothing for you. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2635.0s)]
*  Nothing for you. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2640.0s)]
*  I see fighters, I see runners, I see people who they're great. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2642.0s)]
*  But they get to the edge of their talent, it's like, fuck man, what's up? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2647.0s)]
*  Because you're now at the point now where your talent ain't going to do shit for you, my friend. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2653.0s)]
*  Now it's the mental game. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2660.0s)]
*  And that's where people get lost in life, get lost in that next level. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2662.0s)]
*  And that next level is found for me in the things that I do. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2666.0s)]
*  That's misunderstood. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2670.0s)]
*  That's a giant problem with fighters. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2671.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2673.0s)]
*  There's many fighters that are at the elite level in the gym. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2674.0s)]
*  But when they get tired, when they get pushed, and when they get into that... [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2678.0s)]
*  When the world starts narrowing and the walls start closing in and they can't see peripherally anymore, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2683.0s)]
*  and they're exhausted and they start making mistakes, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2691.0s)]
*  so all of their understanding of what to do next gets clouded because they're thinking about quitting, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2694.0s)]
*  they're thinking about being exhausted, when am I going to get a break, how much do I have left in the tank, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2699.0s)]
*  can I even push forward here, or will I gas out and risk getting stopped? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2705.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what you said goes on in the human mind when you have a talent problem. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2710.0s)]
*  That's exactly what goes on in your mind. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2717.0s)]
*  So how are you going to fucking defeat that, bro? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2719.0s)]
*  You're sitting there getting beat the fuck down by a motherfucker just on you. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2721.0s)]
*  Fucking just throwing you down, take down, take down, take down, hitting the face, hitting the face. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2725.0s)]
*  And all that's going through your mind is what you just fucking said. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2730.0s)]
*  There's no positivity in that. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2734.0s)]
*  But when you train the mind the way I train mine, fucking ready, man. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2736.0s)]
*  Fucking ready because first of all, I didn't have much talent. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2741.0s)]
*  So I had to train one fucking thing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2744.0s)]
*  You better train your fucking mind because my talents can run out way early. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2746.0s)]
*  When shit got hard for me back in the day, bro, I'm done, I'm out, see you. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2750.0s)]
*  Okay, I got to invent a motherfucker that can. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2754.0s)]
*  So I invented Goggins. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2757.0s)]
*  I invented a motherfucker that realized we're not good enough. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2759.0s)]
*  But Goggins realizes we're mentally strong as fuck and we're going to out-strength these motherfuckers in the mind. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2763.0s)]
*  There's a big understanding in fighting that sometimes talent is a curse. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2770.0s)]
*  Because some people are very talented and they just don't work as hard. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2779.0s)]
*  Khabib Nurmagomedov talks about that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2784.0s)]
*  And he's one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2787.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2791.0s)]
*  One of the rare guys to retire undefeated. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2792.0s)]
*  But he's like, talented guys don't work hard enough. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2794.0s)]
*  No. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2797.0s)]
*  He's like, talented guys, the problem with talented guys is they can get by early. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2798.0s)]
*  They're faster than people. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2803.0s)]
*  Maybe they just have a better understanding or better coordination. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2805.0s)]
*  Some people just, we're not even. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2808.0s)]
*  People are not even in their abilities when it comes to sports. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2812.0s)]
*  Some people are just very gifted. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2815.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2817.0s)]
*  But gifted fighters in particular, there's something about it where a lot of them never realize their full potential. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2818.0s)]
*  No. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2827.0s)]
*  Because they don't develop that mental game that you're talking about. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2828.0s)]
*  They don't have to. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2831.0s)]
*  Because they can piece people up on the outside. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2832.0s)]
*  They win fights easy. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2834.0s)]
*  They stop a bunch of people in the first round. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2835.0s)]
*  They look like a hero. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2837.0s)]
*  But then when someone comes along that can survive that first round and then start dragging them into hell. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2839.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2845.0s)]
*  And that's what you said. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2846.0s)]
*  You're dragging a motherfucker into hell who's a demon. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2850.0s)]
*  You're in a long race. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2851.0s)]
*  And they're hard. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2852.0s)]
*  People with a talent problem who are so talented, they're hard to train. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2854.0s)]
*  They're hard to push. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2859.0s)]
*  If you're their coach and you're trying to get them to see that we've got to get you past this talent problem, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2861.0s)]
*  we've got to get you to the point where you're into that mental zone. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2867.0s)]
*  Because we've got to get you way past your talent. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2871.0s)]
*  And it's hard for coaches to take these fighters or whoever past their talent. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2873.0s)]
*  And on the other side of that is where they gain true, true levels. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2879.0s)]
*  The levels beyond talent, that's where it really is. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2884.0s)]
*  Because if you're able to take a motherfucker down to the deep end, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2888.0s)]
*  well, a motherfucker is just putting his toe in, fueling the water and shit. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2891.0s)]
*  If a motherfucker is in the deep end, he'll be able to take you down there and he's mentally strong. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2894.0s)]
*  It's over. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2898.0s)]
*  It's over, man. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2899.0s)]
*  Because they live in the deep end. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2900.0s)]
*  They live in it, man. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2902.0s)]
*  They thrive in it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2904.0s)]
*  It's almost like you have to have the ability to go to the deep end no matter whether or not you'll ever go there. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2905.0s)]
*  Right. Yes. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2911.0s)]
*  And some people are like, well, I'm never going to go to the deep end. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2912.0s)]
*  But you should be able to. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2915.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2917.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2918.0s)]
*  You have to be trained to do it. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2919.0s)]
*  You have to be trained for it. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2920.0s)]
*  For when that time comes, you're like, okay, I'm deep end qualified. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2921.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2926.0s)]
*  I am deep end fucking qualified. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2927.0s)]
*  I got my fucking deep end certification. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2928.0s)]
*  But you know what's interesting about this book is you talk about how there was moments, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2930.0s)]
*  even though you're clearly deep end qualified, clearly deep end certified. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2935.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2940.0s)]
*  You took some time and you hadn't been a deep end for a while and you're like, I'm kind of a part time savage now. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2941.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2945.0s)]
*  This is kind of bullshit. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2946.0s)]
*  And you're recognizing it in yourself. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2947.0s)]
*  Even though you know your ability, you know your history, you know what you've been capable of doing in the past, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2949.0s)]
*  you're like, but I haven't been there. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2955.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2956.0s)]
*  I haven't been there in a while and you had to go back. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2957.0s)]
*  What's funny about that part time savage thing in there, man, where I fucking totally dogged myself, because it's the truth. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2959.0s)]
*  All this became nice. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2965.0s)]
*  Waking up motherfuckers. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2967.0s)]
*  Success. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2968.0s)]
*  Baking in the eggs, motherfucking. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2969.0s)]
*  Fuck protein shake, early morning shit. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2971.0s)]
*  And I stopped having those hard conversations with myself. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2975.0s)]
*  Boy, my whole life. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2980.0s)]
*  That's what my friends hate my ass, boy. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2981.0s)]
*  Because I'm hard on me. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2983.0s)]
*  If I'm hard on me, I don't give a fuck about you. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2984.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about what you think. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2987.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck what you think about me, nothing else. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2989.0s)]
*  Hard on myself, bro. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2990.0s)]
*  Every morning I woke up, all right motherfucker, I call it my morning meeting. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2992.0s)]
*  My morning meeting. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2996.0s)]
*  We all have these fucking meetings all fucking day long. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=2997.0s)]
*  You know, we go to work. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3000.0s)]
*  We're working for somebody else. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3001.0s)]
*  They want a meeting because they want to be successful. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3003.0s)]
*  So we all sit our ass down, try to make them better. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3005.0s)]
*  Try to make them more money. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3007.0s)]
*  Try to make them more powerful. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3008.0s)]
*  We don't do that for ourselves. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3010.0s)]
*  So every morning I wake up, I used to. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3011.0s)]
*  I had to get back into it again because in that chapter, you see, I came to a little pitch. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3013.0s)]
*  That morning meeting, I wake up, okay, Gaggins, what did you do fucked up yesterday? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3018.0s)]
*  Where were you at? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3022.0s)]
*  And I just go through and analyze my life. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3023.0s)]
*  And then I went through a period of time there, man, where I stopped having those conversations. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3025.0s)]
*  You know how you, let's say you and your wife go out. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3029.0s)]
*  Let's say, I don't know, let's make up a story here. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3032.0s)]
*  You and your wife go out and you see your cousin. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3035.0s)]
*  And your cousin's fat as fuck. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3037.0s)]
*  I don't know if they are or not. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3039.0s)]
*  Hopefully not. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3041.0s)]
*  If they are, apologize. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3042.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3043.0s)]
*  So they go out and you see your cousin. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3044.0s)]
*  She's fat as fuck. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3047.0s)]
*  He's fat as fuck, whoever. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3048.0s)]
*  And you guys get back in the car and you guys, man, you see motherfucking Mary Jo? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3049.0s)]
*  How fat she was. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3055.0s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3057.0s)]
*  We go back and the hard conversation that you should be having with Mary Jo, hey, Mary Jo, you fucking gained some weight, huh, sister? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3059.0s)]
*  Fucking kind of big. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3064.0s)]
*  That's what I do to myself. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3066.0s)]
*  A lot of people that we see all day long, we see them. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3068.0s)]
*  We don't have the hard conversation. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3071.0s)]
*  We walk around. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3073.0s)]
*  I rather you fucking hate me and get better than like me and stay the same. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3074.0s)]
*  And that's how I feel about David Goggins. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3079.0s)]
*  Motherfucker, I rather me hate, oh, I hate you, David, man. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3081.0s)]
*  I hate you, David. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3084.0s)]
*  But I get better from it. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3085.0s)]
*  I get better from it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3087.0s)]
*  And that's why when people see me and I know you, you're in my little foxhole. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3088.0s)]
*  If you're in my foxhole and you become a piece of shit, hey, come here, brother. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3092.0s)]
*  Let me talk to you real quick, brother. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3097.0s)]
*  People don't like that shit, man. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3099.0s)]
*  But I'm not going to allow you to go to a place that's going to be hard to get out of. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3100.0s)]
*  It's going to be hard. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3106.0s)]
*  If I allow you to gain five more pounds or allow you to take four more days off of school or allow you to keep on procrastinating in your fucking life. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3108.0s)]
*  And I see it and I tell Jennifer behind your back, I'm doing you no fucking justice. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3116.0s)]
*  Zero justice. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3121.0s)]
*  So where this world is now, you can't say a motherfucking thing. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3122.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3127.0s)]
*  I still do and I always will. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3128.0s)]
*  Don't like me. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3130.0s)]
*  Don't like me. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3131.0s)]
*  I'm good with that. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3132.0s)]
*  That's exactly what's going on with like fat models. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3134.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3138.0s)]
*  I'm proud. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3139.0s)]
*  People are like, you're beautiful no matter what. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3140.0s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3142.0s)]
*  And the thing about it is I have no problem if you want to be fat. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3143.0s)]
*  I have no problem with anybody. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3147.0s)]
*  If you want to be whatever the fuck you want to be. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3149.0s)]
*  But make sure you fucking if you're fat motherfucker, go be fat. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3151.0s)]
*  Go be fat. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3155.0s)]
*  Go be real fucking fat. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3156.0s)]
*  But let's be real. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3157.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to be fat. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3158.0s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3159.0s)]
*  That's why I said it man. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3160.0s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3161.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3162.0s)]
*  They will pretend I'm fine with it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3163.0s)]
*  But if I could give you a button that you could push and boink. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3164.0s)]
*  Be skinny. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3168.0s)]
*  All of a sudden you'd have this incredible body. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3169.0s)]
*  Everybody would push that button. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3171.0s)]
*  But what happens is man we get in this world where it gets hard. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3176.0s)]
*  And so the harder it is, the more you start to push back. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3177.0s)]
*  And the more you push back and it's not right for people to talk about. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3182.0s)]
*  It's not right for like I say you are fat. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3185.0s)]
*  I was fat. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3188.0s)]
*  That's why I talk about it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3189.0s)]
*  Go ahead and say something motherfucker. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3191.0s)]
*  I was fat too. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3192.0s)]
*  And it was hard as fuck every fucking day to get up. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3193.0s)]
*  I know what it feels like when you roll your fat ass out of bed and all you want is some [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3196.0s)]
*  fucking damn cinnamon buns and shit and fucking chocolate milkshake. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3200.0s)]
*  I know what it is. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3203.0s)]
*  I know what it's like. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3205.0s)]
*  But I can't want it more than you. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3206.0s)]
*  And so many people just want it the easy way. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3210.0s)]
*  I'm sorry man. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3213.0s)]
*  It's not. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3214.0s)]
*  So what they start to do is they build this narrative of it's okay. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3215.0s)]
*  When the narrative should be you need to fucking work harder. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3221.0s)]
*  You need to fucking discipline your mind better. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3225.0s)]
*  We need to help people more than just saying it's okay. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3227.0s)]
*  It's okay that you're not fucking willing to fucking help yourself out. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3232.0s)]
*  That's not okay. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3236.0s)]
*  It's not okay. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3237.0s)]
*  It's not acceptable. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3238.0s)]
*  Even though it's your life, if that's acceptable, that's unacceptable. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3239.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of people in this world, me included, that if I accepted that, I wouldn't [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3244.0s)]
*  be anywhere. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3249.0s)]
*  So yeah, a lot of people just fucking, they start creating a narrative about themselves [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3250.0s)]
*  that make it okay. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3256.0s)]
*  The ultimate get out of jail free card. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3257.0s)]
*  And now the world is set up to have so many get out of jail free cards. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3259.0s)]
*  Everything is okay. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3264.0s)]
*  And you can't say a motherfucking thing about it. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3265.0s)]
*  This is what it's interesting though, is that when you're talking about how you had to come [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3268.0s)]
*  to this realization that you'd become a part time savage. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3273.0s)]
*  This isn't recently. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3276.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's looking at 2000. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3278.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3282.0s)]
*  2018. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3284.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3285.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3286.0s)]
*  2018. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3287.0s)]
*  Not that long ago. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3288.0s)]
*  No, fuck no. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3289.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3290.0s)]
*  So even though you've been through all those things and you have all this information [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3291.0s)]
*  in your head, it's like there's no rest. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3294.0s)]
*  No. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3296.0s)]
*  There's no chance. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3297.0s)]
*  And if you do take a little time and start enjoying it, all of a sudden that general [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3298.0s)]
*  in the back of your head is like, Hey, hey, look what you're doing. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3302.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3305.0s)]
*  You're being a little bitch. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3306.0s)]
*  And so in your mind, you had gotten soft. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3307.0s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3311.0s)]
*  And my softness was still two days. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3312.0s)]
*  So if you look in there, two days was you being soft. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3315.0s)]
*  My part time savage was me running like 50 miles a week. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3318.0s)]
*  Me fucking not. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3322.0s)]
*  You know, because what I used to do and what I do now is I got to a point I'd be running [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3324.0s)]
*  and I was like, okay, man, we could do 10 miles today. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3328.0s)]
*  I get to 10 miles. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3332.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh no motherfucker. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3333.0s)]
*  That fucking demon that I let out every fucking morning that walks the streets at night. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3335.0s)]
*  He comes saying, oh bitch, not today, man. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3339.0s)]
*  There's somebody out there that you don't know, have never fucking met in your entire [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3342.0s)]
*  life that is doing 12, 13, 14. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3346.0s)]
*  You're going to do another one. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3349.0s)]
*  And when you meet them, you ain't going to be fucking ready. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3351.0s)]
*  So Goggins kept on running. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3355.0s)]
*  So you talk about that and you talk about how Cam came to visit you in Vegas and give [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3358.0s)]
*  you a spot check. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3362.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3363.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3364.0s)]
*  I'm always ready for a motherfucker like Cam. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3365.0s)]
*  I'm always ready for a motherfucker like Cam. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3366.0s)]
*  So out of nowhere, dude, this guy calls me literally. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3368.0s)]
*  And this is one thing about life. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3371.0s)]
*  This is why you always must be ready. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3373.0s)]
*  Always be ready. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3376.0s)]
*  Never get ready. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3378.0s)]
*  People go, oh hey, what are you training for, David? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3379.0s)]
*  I ain't training for shit. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3381.0s)]
*  When something pops up, I'll be fucking ready. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3383.0s)]
*  So when Cam popped the fuck up and Cam calls, hey man, I'm going to be in Las Vegas. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3385.0s)]
*  You want to go for a run? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3391.0s)]
*  Sure do. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3393.0s)]
*  Sure do, brother. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3395.0s)]
*  Sure do. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3396.0s)]
*  While the run sucked, I was ready. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3397.0s)]
*  Well, you guys were doing like six minute miles for like 26 miles. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3400.0s)]
*  It was 20 miles and Jennifer was with us. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3404.0s)]
*  And so Jennifer can run her fucking ass off. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3407.0s)]
*  She's fast as shit. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3409.0s)]
*  So we went out, but she's not a six minute mile runner. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3411.0s)]
*  So we went out for the first 10 and Jennifer was with us. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3414.0s)]
*  She was with us for the first seven. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3417.0s)]
*  She turned around, I think she did like 15 miles. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3419.0s)]
*  So me and Cam went out after we left Jennifer, she went back for another three to go out [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3421.0s)]
*  and get 10 and come back 10. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3426.0s)]
*  But my whole idea was I know the course, bitch. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3428.0s)]
*  I'm about to drop your fucking ass, motherfucker. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3431.0s)]
*  So we go out because going out is a little bit downhill. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3435.0s)]
*  So we turn around 10 mile more and come back. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3446.0s)]
*  And I could tell Cam was hurting, boy. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3449.0s)]
*  But Cam's a prideful motherfucker, dude. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3451.0s)]
*  Prideful motherfucker, love that dude. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3454.0s)]
*  So we get to about mile 16, 17. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3456.0s)]
*  And I could tell now he kind of comes off my shoulder slightly. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3459.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, chink in the armor. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3464.0s)]
*  I feel it. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3467.0s)]
*  You know, you always can look out of your peripheral vision. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3469.0s)]
*  But I'm like, this is a prideful motherfucker, man. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3472.0s)]
*  And we keep on going, man, holding sixes. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3475.0s)]
*  We get to about mile 18, I look, Cam's right back on the shoulder. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3478.0s)]
*  And I just smiled. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3482.0s)]
*  I said, you are exactly who the fuck I thought you were, motherfucker. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3484.0s)]
*  And so we went out, tested each other, man. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3487.0s)]
*  Good day. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3490.0s)]
*  Went to the gym, worked out hard. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3491.0s)]
*  Same day. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3493.0s)]
*  Saying, oh, we fucking worked it out, dude. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3494.0s)]
*  Whenever we meet him together, you can guarantee it's going to be two people [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3496.0s)]
*  that love each other but are waiting for the other motherfucker to break. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3501.0s)]
*  100%, dude. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3506.0s)]
*  It's like this thing in the back of your head, OK, maybe this will break him. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3508.0s)]
*  Maybe this will break him. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3511.0s)]
*  So we haven't broken each other yet, but I'm sure the day will come. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3512.0s)]
*  So you run 20 miles and then you lift weights. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3516.0s)]
*  But see, lifting weights, people don't get it, man. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3519.0s)]
*  It's not like lifting weights. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3521.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, we go and do like so many reps. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3523.0s)]
*  Like people go, oh, you're only doing, it was like 90-some pounds on the incline. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3527.0s)]
*  Motherfucker, do five sets of 25 with a superset of pushups, superset of curls, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3533.0s)]
*  superset of pull-ups, superset of triceps, superset of, what the fuck else was it? [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3540.0s)]
*  I forget what else. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3544.0s)]
*  It's a superset, man. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3545.0s)]
*  So we're going through lifting lightweight but for massive, massive amounts of reps. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3546.0s)]
*  And so you're like totally swollen. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3551.0s)]
*  And like it's just some of the best workouts in the world between me and him. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3553.0s)]
*  Some of the best workouts in the world, man. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3557.0s)]
*  And then you had steak. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3559.0s)]
*  And then we had steak. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3561.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3562.0s)]
*  And then I treat cancer as steak. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3563.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3564.0s)]
*  And that's a mental aid station. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3565.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3567.0s)]
*  Mental aid station, baby. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3568.0s)]
*  I think one of the most important parts about the way you express yourself in your books is that you do talk about your weaknesses. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3570.0s)]
*  And you do talk about your past and how you started off on this journey. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3577.0s)]
*  And you talk about how there are those moments that you doubt. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3581.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3585.0s)]
*  And you, but you still go. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3586.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3587.0s)]
*  Sometimes like, you know, I call it, you got to call it audible. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3588.0s)]
*  You know, the line of screamers, man, like some of the great quarterbacks, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3591.0s)]
*  they'll be at the line of screamers and they'll look at the defense. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3595.0s)]
*  The defense is, oh, fuck. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3598.0s)]
*  Defense is shifting. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3600.0s)]
*  And you call it audible. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3601.0s)]
*  In my mind, a lot of times, man, I'm like, it doesn't mean I quit. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3603.0s)]
*  I don't quit. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3607.0s)]
*  You know, I may not make it the first time, but I'll come back. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3608.0s)]
*  I got to call it audible. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3612.0s)]
*  I got to fucking, I got to, I got to fucking get my head back in the game. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3614.0s)]
*  I got to, I got to figure this shit out. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3617.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you leave. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3619.0s)]
*  It means you study it more. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3621.0s)]
*  It means you study it more. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3622.0s)]
*  And whenever I feel that something, people are saying, man, how do you handle failure, man? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3624.0s)]
*  I fail a lot, dude. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3628.0s)]
*  I fail all the fucking time. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3630.0s)]
*  They go, how do you handle it? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3632.0s)]
*  What I'm trying to do, and this isn't being arrogant, man, it's being real. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3634.0s)]
*  Not many people are trying to do. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3639.0s)]
*  So there's not many people who can even open their fucking mouth and criticize me when I do fail. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3641.0s)]
*  Because I'm on, I'm trying to do shit, man, that many people aren't trying to do. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3648.0s)]
*  But I don't look at failure as failure. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3652.0s)]
*  I look at failure as your first, second, third, fourth, fifth attempt. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3654.0s)]
*  I look at them as attempts. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3658.0s)]
*  I don't look at anything as failure. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3660.0s)]
*  Because when you're willing to try to do something, not trying is failure. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3662.0s)]
*  That's not some after school special shit. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3666.0s)]
*  But when you're able to go out there, there is no failure. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3670.0s)]
*  It's attempts. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3673.0s)]
*  Because when you're trying to do something that's bigger than you, whatever you are, whoever you are, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3674.0s)]
*  if you're paralyzed, you're trying to walk one step and you didn't, you didn't fail, motherfucker. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3678.0s)]
*  That was your first attempt. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3683.0s)]
*  If that's your biggest thing, that's how your mindset needs to go into everything. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3685.0s)]
*  So I don't look at it as failure is a big word that gets people down and shit. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3689.0s)]
*  We give so much power to words. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3694.0s)]
*  I don't. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3696.0s)]
*  I take the power right away. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3697.0s)]
*  I didn't fail shit. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3698.0s)]
*  Do you ever have conversations with Cam about mindset? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3700.0s)]
*  No, we really don't go there too much at all about mindset. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3704.0s)]
*  Whenever we get together, it's really about breaking the motherfuckers down. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3708.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you be interested though in how he approached? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3713.0s)]
*  Because I don't know if everybody shares your approach. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3716.0s)]
*  I know there's not very many people like you. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3720.0s)]
*  Cam is one of them. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3722.0s)]
*  So how many of them are like you? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3724.0s)]
*  And how many of them have that sort of similar approach? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3726.0s)]
*  And how many of them are willing to discuss their own demons? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3729.0s)]
*  Because a lot of people that are like super endurance athletes or very hard people, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3733.0s)]
*  they don't ever want to even discuss the weakness. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3738.0s)]
*  They don't want to shine any light on it. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3740.0s)]
*  No, people hate that. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3742.0s)]
*  People hate it, man. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3743.0s)]
*  And I love it. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3744.0s)]
*  And the reason people hate it, to me, this is just my own theory, is because you haven't beat it. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3745.0s)]
*  That's why. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3751.0s)]
*  People go, man, why are you so open and vulnerable? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3752.0s)]
*  I'll tell you everything. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3755.0s)]
*  I lied about everything. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3756.0s)]
*  I fucked up with everything. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3757.0s)]
*  I'll tell you everything. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3758.0s)]
*  I'm an open fucking book. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3760.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3761.0s)]
*  The only reason why I don't give a fuck anymore is because I overcame it and I beat it. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3762.0s)]
*  So now I'm going to talk about it. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3769.0s)]
*  Why most people aren't willing to go to that darkness and that vulnerability is because they're still dealing with it. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3770.0s)]
*  When people who have overcome it, they're open fucking book, bro, because they're proud. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3776.0s)]
*  They're fucking proud. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3782.0s)]
*  That's why I speak. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3784.0s)]
*  Man, why are you always yelling? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3785.0s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3786.0s)]
*  This is how I talk, bitch, because I'm proud, motherfucker. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3787.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3789.0s)]
*  I'm proud, motherfucker, man. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3790.0s)]
*  It's not proud like, look at me. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3791.0s)]
*  It's like, motherfucker, I know where I fucking came from, bitch. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3793.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be here right now talking to you. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3797.0s)]
*  Shouldn't be talking to you, motherfucker. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3799.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be here. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3801.0s)]
*  I'm just a fat, sloppy motherfucker. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3802.0s)]
*  I'm proud. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3803.0s)]
*  So I'm able to tell you I was fucked up. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3804.0s)]
*  Many people can't. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3808.0s)]
*  You know, that's a common thing that people say when I interview them after fights. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3809.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not supposed to be here. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3815.0s)]
*  This is not supposed to happen to me. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3816.0s)]
*  There's a common thing when I've had conversations with people and they've won a big fight, they've [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3818.0s)]
*  had this big event, they say I wasn't supposed to be here. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3824.0s)]
*  Statistically. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3828.0s)]
*  Like, Chris Gutierrez just said that last UFC fight when I interviewed him. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3830.0s)]
*  It's like, I'm not supposed to be here. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3834.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3836.0s)]
*  Probably because they come from a bad place. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3837.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3839.0s)]
*  You know, especially when you're young. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3840.0s)]
*  You know, we develop self-esteem, you know, by the age of seven. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3842.0s)]
*  If you're not good by the age of seven or eight years old, you have a good chance of [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3848.0s)]
*  being fucked the rest of your life. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3853.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3855.0s)]
*  So if your parents or you came up wrong, and then seven or eight, if you don't have the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3856.0s)]
*  self-esteem, but you fucking grind, you're like, I want to be better. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3861.0s)]
*  When you get to that UFC championship or you get to where I got or where I am, you know, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3864.0s)]
*  it's almost like you can't believe the journey. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3871.0s)]
*  Like I talked about in that fucking VFW, in the first chapter of that book, man, I'm sitting [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3873.0s)]
*  in that audience with all those fucking people and I'm about to get the Americanism award. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3878.0s)]
*  And I was grinding so hard, I never took time to reflect on my life. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3883.0s)]
*  And this was like time to reflect. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3887.0s)]
*  And I was all kind of fucked up. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3890.0s)]
*  I got on stage, man, just fucking cried for like 59 seconds. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3892.0s)]
*  And it was such an emotional moment for me that I fucking did what I did. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3895.0s)]
*  And I overcame it. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3901.0s)]
*  And it was alone, man. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3902.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of people have fucking like teammates and fucking like, you know, family [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3905.0s)]
*  push. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3909.0s)]
*  My mom was struggling, bro. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3910.0s)]
*  She was struggling. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3911.0s)]
*  So it was like me and my mom. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3912.0s)]
*  And so it was a lot of just me. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3914.0s)]
*  So when you're waking up every morning by yourself and you're fucking getting after [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3916.0s)]
*  by yourself and it's the hidden work. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3920.0s)]
*  People see one minute video of me running and shit and like these fighters, you know, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3925.0s)]
*  they see during the fight or after the fight. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3930.0s)]
*  They don't see these motherfuckers, man, what they deal with every fucking day. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3933.0s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3937.0s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3938.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be here. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3939.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be here. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3940.0s)]
*  Because every day, even though they're fucking the best in the world, that little motherfucker [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3941.0s)]
*  at seven or eight years old is still in there saying, oh, man, we don't have something. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3945.0s)]
*  I'm not good enough. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3949.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3950.0s)]
*  I shouldn't be here. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3951.0s)]
*  So you always fighting that motherfucker, even though you beat it. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3952.0s)]
*  You never truly beat it. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3954.0s)]
*  So when they get on stage and talking to Joe Rogan, it's not even real. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3956.0s)]
*  It's not real. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3961.0s)]
*  All those mornings that you don't want to fucking get up. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3962.0s)]
*  And I look at it as like a fucking like a rock. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3964.0s)]
*  And you find this fucking rock and that rock is you. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3969.0s)]
*  And every day you fucking fight not wanting to get up. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3971.0s)]
*  And you do anyway. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3975.0s)]
*  You chip another piece off that fucking rock. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3977.0s)]
*  And every day you fucking eat the right foods. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3979.0s)]
*  And every day you go to train, you train harder and harder and harder and harder. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3981.0s)]
*  And you get up early and all these things you do to start forming yourself. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3984.0s)]
*  You're chipping another fucking piece of that rock. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3988.0s)]
*  I mean, before you know it, you have this beautiful fucking piece of artwork that you built. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3991.0s)]
*  But people don't. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3997.0s)]
*  And then once you get there, you see it. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=3998.0s)]
*  It becomes real. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4000.0s)]
*  Like, oh, my God, I fucking did this shit. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4001.0s)]
*  And so like the fucking journey becomes so real then. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4003.0s)]
*  But so many people aren't willing to fucking chip away at that stone that is them to start chipping off those fucking rough edges. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4006.0s)]
*  That's the fear. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4013.0s)]
*  The fear is never reaching your potential. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4014.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4016.0s)]
*  That always falling short, always quitting before you're done, always procrastinating, always not doing the right thing. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4017.0s)]
*  And then one day you're an old man. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4027.0s)]
*  And you look back and go, God, I could have been great. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4028.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4030.0s)]
*  I could have been great. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4031.0s)]
*  I'll never forget one time I was running by a graveyard. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4032.0s)]
*  I was fucking just trying to become, I was fat. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4035.0s)]
*  And I ran by a graveyard and I looked out there. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4039.0s)]
*  And I have all these epiphanies, man. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4042.0s)]
*  I have all these fucking moments of like, of, it's crazy, man, of this thought. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4044.0s)]
*  Because I'm always by myself and always in deep fucking thought about how to be better. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4048.0s)]
*  And I look out there, I'm like, man, I wonder how many of you motherfuckers in there fucking just are so upset with how you lived your life. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4052.0s)]
*  And fucking just regret how you lived it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4061.0s)]
*  And I'm running at 300 pound man thinking, man, don't fucking die like this, bro. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4063.0s)]
*  Don't die like this. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4069.0s)]
*  So people wonder where this shit comes from for me. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4071.0s)]
*  It comes from such deep thought of trying to see what this is all about. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4074.0s)]
*  What is this life all about? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4079.0s)]
*  What am I all about? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4081.0s)]
*  Why am I here? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4082.0s)]
*  You know, I had to find purpose in my suffering. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4084.0s)]
*  It had a purpose. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4090.0s)]
*  It had a fucking purpose. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4092.0s)]
*  Do you talk to other people that are like you and try to understand if they're going through the same thing? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4094.0s)]
*  Are they trying to gather knowledge as well? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4099.0s)]
*  Are they just doing it because they're addicted to runner's high? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4102.0s)]
*  Are they doing it because they enjoy the challenge? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4105.0s)]
*  How many people do you talk to that are like you? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4108.0s)]
*  I've never talked to anyone that, and most people don't even believe when I say half time, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4112.0s)]
*  that I do it to fucking gain knowledge and all that shit. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4117.0s)]
*  I haven't met one that goes out there. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4121.0s)]
*  People really enjoy a lot of the shit that they do. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4123.0s)]
*  Like they, I don't know many people who can go out and run 240 miles at one time if you don't enjoy it. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4127.0s)]
*  If you just don't really enjoy it. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4134.0s)]
*  So, you know, I had many people build confidence in different ways and they build belief in different ways. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4137.0s)]
*  Coming from where I came from, I didn't have any belief in myself. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4147.0s)]
*  So some people can go read a book and get belief. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4152.0s)]
*  Some people can go take a yoga class, have good parents. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4155.0s)]
*  I had to put myself, so where I came from was so far down underneath like soil [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4159.0s)]
*  that I had to build belief by truly ingraining it in my brain. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4167.0s)]
*  So the things I do, I'm always every day building belief. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4173.0s)]
*  And my belief had to be where it is because I was so far down. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4179.0s)]
*  So it may take a 200 mile run for me. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4182.0s)]
*  It may take a 100 mile run. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4184.0s)]
*  It may take late nights in the gym. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4185.0s)]
*  But without belief, you have nothing. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4188.0s)]
*  And I realized that when I was a young kid, I have no belief. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4191.0s)]
*  I have to build it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4194.0s)]
*  And a five mile run didn't do it. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4195.0s)]
*  I had to push myself to such extremes because I came from, people judge me by not knowing where I came from. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4198.0s)]
*  So unless you're me and you came from where I came from, I guarantee you wouldn't have made it out. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4205.0s)]
*  Guarantee it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4211.0s)]
*  And I knew that. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4212.0s)]
*  So my belief comes from going, I had to build it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4213.0s)]
*  And that's how I built it, man. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4216.0s)]
*  I built it by the things I do. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4217.0s)]
*  It's so painful reading about your childhood and the experiences with your father. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4219.0s)]
*  And then when you went back and met your father as an adult and got with them and watched him get drunk and then watch him get belligerent and experience it all over again. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4225.0s)]
*  And then think about what happened to him to make him who he is. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4241.0s)]
*  Yeah, that fucked me up, dude. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4244.0s)]
*  I had to go like, I realized I was fucked. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4246.0s)]
*  I was just a sorry motherfucker. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4249.0s)]
*  I quit para rescue. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4252.0s)]
*  I was free of the water. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4254.0s)]
*  Every time shit got hard. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4255.0s)]
*  Like I said, I didn't have talent. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4256.0s)]
*  I fucking didn't have shit. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4258.0s)]
*  Whenever shit got hard for me, I thought I was on my way out and I got sucked back in. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4260.0s)]
*  I become a loser again, real quick. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4264.0s)]
*  And I see him all the time. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4266.0s)]
*  There's a lot of fucking losers out here that won't face it. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4267.0s)]
*  I was like, oh man, you got to go back and visit this motherfucker. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4270.0s)]
*  I haven't seen my dad in fucking years, man. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4274.0s)]
*  Years. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4277.0s)]
*  But I knew where I came from. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4278.0s)]
*  I knew where my mindset came from. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4280.0s)]
*  I knew where my demons were. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4282.0s)]
*  So my whole idea, I went back to see my dad, was I was hoping that I could just fucking call myself a loser and it's because of you, dad. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4284.0s)]
*  So I was hoping to go back and get the confirmation that I always wanted. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4293.0s)]
*  That wasn't my fault. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4297.0s)]
*  That voice in my head was so loud. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4299.0s)]
*  It's not your fault, David. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4301.0s)]
*  It's not your fault you can't read and write. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4302.0s)]
*  It's not your fault that people call you fucking niggas. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4304.0s)]
*  It's not your fault. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4306.0s)]
*  It's not your fault this. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4307.0s)]
*  It's not your fault that. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4308.0s)]
*  It's not your fault that you're fat. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4309.0s)]
*  It's not your fault that you quit shit. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4310.0s)]
*  It's not your fault. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4313.0s)]
*  So I was like, okay, man, I'm going to go back and visit this motherfucker so I can just squash it and I can just go on and be a fucking loser because you fucked me up. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4314.0s)]
*  And I got there, I drove to Buffalo, saw my dad. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4322.0s)]
*  Same routine as it was when I was eight years old, man. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4326.0s)]
*  Walked in. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4329.0s)]
*  What's up? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4330.0s)]
*  Went to Skateland. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4331.0s)]
*  I sat in that fucking couch that you would cheat on my mom with. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4332.0s)]
*  I sat on that couch in the corner and I was like, God, what the fuck, man? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4336.0s)]
*  And it was a whole normal day. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4340.0s)]
*  And the more I was around him, now he started getting drunk and I won't go through the whole thing. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4342.0s)]
*  But I started seeing him, man. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4347.0s)]
*  I started having a conversation. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4349.0s)]
*  I always had these conversations with myself. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4350.0s)]
*  Like, man, this motherfucker, he came from hell. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4352.0s)]
*  His dad would put him in front of a furnace. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4357.0s)]
*  And like, if he moved, he'd get burnt. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4360.0s)]
*  So when my dad got beat, his dad would put him in front of a furnace. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4363.0s)]
*  And if he would have moved, he'd fucking get burnt up. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4369.0s)]
*  So my dad said, I'd sit there and take it. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4372.0s)]
*  So he never dealt with his fucking demons. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4374.0s)]
*  So his demons became mine. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4377.0s)]
*  His demons became mine. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4379.0s)]
*  Motherfuckers think you die and the demon goes with you, man. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4381.0s)]
*  Don't be a fucking fool, bro. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4386.0s)]
*  You know, like, that's why I'm proud of myself. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4388.0s)]
*  I took his demons and mine. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4390.0s)]
*  And people were always looking for some great fucking apology. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4392.0s)]
*  You know, oh my God, like, you know, my dad needs to say sorry. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4395.0s)]
*  Or people who fucking called you out your name. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4400.0s)]
*  Or nobody's going to come back and say sorry to you, motherfucker. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4402.0s)]
*  Ain't nobody saying shit to you. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4406.0s)]
*  You'd be a fucking man to fuck up. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4408.0s)]
*  So I looked at him. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4409.0s)]
*  He didn't face his demons, but I'm going to face mine. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4411.0s)]
*  So I let him drive back home. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4413.0s)]
*  That's what I started doing. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4415.0s)]
*  You know what's one of the most fucked up things that I've learned over time [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4416.0s)]
*  is that almost all truly exceptional and mentally strong people have been through hell. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4420.0s)]
*  It's very few that put themselves through hell when life is great. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4427.0s)]
*  It's just not usually the case. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4432.0s)]
*  And to achieve the standards that you've achieved, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4434.0s)]
*  to become the person that you are today and to have the influence that you have, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4438.0s)]
*  this global influence on people, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4443.0s)]
*  do you know how many people have laced up their shoes because they heard your voice? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4445.0s)]
*  How many people have just moved into action and changed their life [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4449.0s)]
*  because they've heard you talk or seen you talk? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4453.0s)]
*  There's a thing that happened and it happened out of hell. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4456.0s)]
*  And I don't think it ever happens without that. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4461.0s)]
*  It's like you had to go through that in order to empower all these other people, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4465.0s)]
*  in order to become who you are and that as an example, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4471.0s)]
*  and then your words as an example, and your describing of it, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4475.0s)]
*  and then your description of your own shortcomings and failures that give people confidence [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4479.0s)]
*  that it's not like you're this superhuman person that is like a character in a book. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4484.0s)]
*  You're a real human being who has real insecurities and real failures in your past and real demons. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4490.0s)]
*  And you've figured out a way to harness that energy and just keep going forward and not quit. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4498.0s)]
*  That's it. I mean there are no time outs. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4505.0s)]
*  There's a part in the book that I talk about a prisoner mind and that's about my mother. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4509.0s)]
*  And she just, I will never listen to that part again in that book. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4518.0s)]
*  That was hard. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4524.0s)]
*  Just so you know man, I will never again listen to that shit. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4525.0s)]
*  Your mother is very, very, very brave. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4529.0s)]
*  To be able to talk like that. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4531.0s)]
*  To be able to talk like that to the world. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4533.0s)]
*  And to just, she lost her life. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4541.0s)]
*  She lost this giant chunk of her life with this abusive man. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4547.0s)]
*  To hear her talk about him hitting her and what it was like and the fact that she never came from a family that hit her. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4551.0s)]
*  She had never been hit before. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4561.0s)]
*  Never. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4563.0s)]
*  And to have her express it the way she did so honestly and openly. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4564.0s)]
*  It's very powerful. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4570.0s)]
*  And the whole time she's talking man, she's on the cusp of losing it. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4571.0s)]
*  Like I'm in the other room, so I'm interviewing her. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4575.0s)]
*  And I'm hearing this shit so I knew a lot about it obviously. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4579.0s)]
*  I lived it. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4583.0s)]
*  And that's what fucked me up the most man. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4584.0s)]
*  When you see, like I said I wasn't a smart kid growing up. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4586.0s)]
*  But whatever made me, whatever the fuck made me, I'm so fucking, my mind is sharp man. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4590.0s)]
*  Like it's crazy. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4599.0s)]
*  Like I was so aware of so much shit. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4602.0s)]
*  I was so bright in that way. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4606.0s)]
*  And to see your mom go through that shit as that young kid. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4608.0s)]
*  And like I was going through it and she was going through it right beside me. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4611.0s)]
*  Like when I got my ass beat, she got her ass beat. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4615.0s)]
*  It's fucked up man. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4618.0s)]
*  Like you just can't, you know people like to judge who you are. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4619.0s)]
*  Man why you cuss so much man? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4623.0s)]
*  My life wasn't fucking PG motherfucker. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4625.0s)]
*  Like you know you can't just turn who the fuck you are off. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4628.0s)]
*  When you see your mom go with that kind of shit. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4630.0s)]
*  And then I'm coming to her defense at seven or eight years old and she's getting her fucking ass beat by a 220 pound man. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4633.0s)]
*  And I'm fucking some little kid. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4641.0s)]
*  You know what kind of curves it takes to muster that up to go help her out and see her fucked up like that. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4643.0s)]
*  And the time she would cry and be bruised up and shit. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4648.0s)]
*  It was just, it was a fucking nightmare. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4651.0s)]
*  And then to hear her talk about it, like the part where my dad says, I brought this belt from Texas. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4653.0s)]
*  This belt came all the way from Texas to whip your ass with. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4659.0s)]
*  It was like what the fuck, where am I at right now? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4662.0s)]
*  Because I knew no other households were fucking living like this man. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4666.0s)]
*  And I knew it. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4671.0s)]
*  And I knew it. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4673.0s)]
*  And then she was shut off. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4674.0s)]
*  She was shut off from the world. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4676.0s)]
*  And when I wrote can't hurt me, she refused. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4678.0s)]
*  She said fuck don't put my shit in there. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4681.0s)]
*  She was so embarrassed. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4684.0s)]
*  You know like I put in there man, she fucking married a fucking prisoner. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4686.0s)]
*  So my mom was so fucked up. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4691.0s)]
*  She was so fucked up by this shit. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4693.0s)]
*  And people go, man you're a mama's boy. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4695.0s)]
*  Motherfucker I ain't no mama's boy man. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4699.0s)]
*  See your mom go through this shit, you gotta make sure she's taken care of. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4701.0s)]
*  So she came out and one of the people that, she got married a few times. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4705.0s)]
*  Because she was looking for something that my dad stripped from her. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4711.0s)]
*  And she was out. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4715.0s)]
*  She was gone for years. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4716.0s)]
*  She's not coming back, she's 70, she's 75. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4718.0s)]
*  But in that book I talk about man, she's like don't put that, you know, can't hurt me. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4720.0s)]
*  But now she's getting better. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4725.0s)]
*  And she's allowing me to talk more about my life. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4727.0s)]
*  Which was also some of her life. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4730.0s)]
*  The part about marrying a prisoner is so crazy. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4732.0s)]
*  Dude, it was a fucking, but. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4734.0s)]
*  Not just a prisoner, but a prisoner who killed a woman. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4736.0s)]
*  Dude, this. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4739.0s)]
*  So it was so fucked up. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4743.0s)]
*  It's hard for me to even talk about because it's almost like. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4744.0s)]
*  I had a front row seat at a horror show. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4747.0s)]
*  So when my mom left my dad, she went to Wilmeth and he got murdered. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4749.0s)]
*  I talk about that in Can't Hurt Me. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4755.0s)]
*  He got murdered. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4756.0s)]
*  So that took her all the way over the edge. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4757.0s)]
*  I mean he got shot fucking six times. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4759.0s)]
*  And the last shot, this motherfucker got right up on his head and made sure he was dead. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4761.0s)]
*  Like forehead shot. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4767.0s)]
*  And so she didn't cry. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4769.0s)]
*  She didn't cry. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4772.0s)]
*  She's lost, it was over. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4773.0s)]
*  She, a whole other person became. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4775.0s)]
*  And so I'm fucking now like 12, 13, 14, whatever the fuck I was. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4777.0s)]
*  I'm watching this woman every day. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4780.0s)]
*  Front row seat, just watching her. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4782.0s)]
*  Just going through life fucked up. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4784.0s)]
*  And then I'm about to go into the military. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4786.0s)]
*  Into the Air Force. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4788.0s)]
*  And like two years out, man. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4790.0s)]
*  I'm like a sophomore in high school. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4792.0s)]
*  Phone's ringing. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4794.0s)]
*  Every night she tell me don't get on the phone. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4795.0s)]
*  Don't get on the phone. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4797.0s)]
*  Don't get on the phone. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4798.0s)]
*  15 minute calls, hang up. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4799.0s)]
*  15 minute call, hang up. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4801.0s)]
*  15 minute call, hang up. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4803.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4804.0s)]
*  But see the way I was growing, like the way I was raised. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4805.0s)]
*  You don't ask your mom what's going on. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4808.0s)]
*  It ain't like now conversations and shit with your parents. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4811.0s)]
*  You shut the fuck up. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4814.0s)]
*  And I didn't ask shit, but I knew something was fucked. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4816.0s)]
*  Because like three, four hours a night. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4818.0s)]
*  15 minute hang up. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4820.0s)]
*  Because he was in prison. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4821.0s)]
*  This guy was in prison so he only had 15 minutes on the phone. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4822.0s)]
*  He had to put more money in it. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4825.0s)]
*  How did you meet him? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4826.0s)]
*  She started working. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4827.0s)]
*  So she was always about helping people out. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4829.0s)]
*  But the thing about it was like I was right in front of her. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4832.0s)]
*  And needed so much fucking help. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4837.0s)]
*  And it was fucked up for me for a long time. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4840.0s)]
*  But she helped out so many people. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4843.0s)]
*  But I guess since I was with her through the journey, I didn't count. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4845.0s)]
*  But it's all good, man. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4849.0s)]
*  It's what life's about. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4851.0s)]
*  You got to understand what your mom went through so that I can be good with it. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4852.0s)]
*  You know, like I saw that. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4856.0s)]
*  So I had to man up a lot more. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4858.0s)]
*  So she saw people needed help. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4860.0s)]
*  So she started teaching in the prison. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4863.0s)]
*  So she had a full time job at DePaul University in Green Castle, Indiana. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4865.0s)]
*  And then she started teaching in a prison. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4871.0s)]
*  And she met this prisoner. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4873.0s)]
*  This prisoner obviously, I don't know, slitter or node or some bullshit like that. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4874.0s)]
*  And she was looking for anything. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4877.0s)]
*  She was looking for anybody that loved her because my dad beat the fucking life out of her. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4880.0s)]
*  And my dad, so my dad wouldn't marry my mom, but ended up marrying a woman that was tied to like, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4885.0s)]
*  I'm not even going to go there. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4897.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to get fucking sued and shit right now, man. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4899.0s)]
*  But he married somebody that was fucked up. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4901.0s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4905.0s)]
*  So anyway, she met him in prison and the phone was ringing every night. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4906.0s)]
*  She didn't tell me about it because how could tell your son, hey, David, I'm in love with the prisoner. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4913.0s)]
*  So before I go, oh, no, I'm about to get to that. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4920.0s)]
*  So I'm fucking now about a week out or whatever the fucking was from leaving for boot camp. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4923.0s)]
*  And she lets me know what's up. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4930.0s)]
*  And so I'm about to leave for boot camp. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4934.0s)]
*  I'm so protective of my mom and she lays this on me. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4941.0s)]
*  Sit down. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4943.0s)]
*  Let's have a talk. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4944.0s)]
*  And she never does this shit, man. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4946.0s)]
*  She's like, there was nothing ever hidden from me. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4947.0s)]
*  That's why I grew up so fast. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4950.0s)]
*  Like that abusive life and what she was going through, it was front and center, her being broke, everything. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4952.0s)]
*  This was the only secret she kept from me. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4957.0s)]
*  She was on those phone calls. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4959.0s)]
*  You know, I've been seeing someone in prison. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4962.0s)]
*  All right. Cool. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4967.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4968.0s)]
*  I'm thinking, what the fuck is this, man? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4969.0s)]
*  So, you know, I hate it. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4971.0s)]
*  I didn't want to ask. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4972.0s)]
*  How the fuck do you get to prison? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4974.0s)]
*  So I'm sitting there, I'm sitting there, I'm sitting there and I'm like, OK, man, I got to fucking ask this question. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4977.0s)]
*  How the fuck, you know, what happened? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4983.0s)]
*  You know, she's like, well, does one of those things, you know, because she knows it's fucking bad. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4985.0s)]
*  Well, he was in the drugs and stuff like that. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4991.0s)]
*  I'm thinking, OK, maybe drug dealer, something like that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4994.0s)]
*  He was in the drugs, that's for sure. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4997.0s)]
*  But he literally, I don't know how it went down, but he choked a woman to death over some drugs. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=4999.0s)]
*  And I don't know the ins and outs or all this other shit. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5010.0s)]
*  And that's who she was going to fucking be with. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5013.0s)]
*  And he was getting out of prison literally in a few weeks after I was going to Air Force boot camp. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5018.0s)]
*  So I'm in fucking Air Force boot camp thinking about my mom's about to fucking marry a fucking dude who got sent to prison. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5025.0s)]
*  Marry him right away, too. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5032.0s)]
*  Right away. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5033.0s)]
*  So the first time I meet this motherfucker dude is at my fucking Air Force graduation. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5035.0s)]
*  My fucking Air Force graduation. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5042.0s)]
*  And she was like, you ain't putting that shit in can't hurt me. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5044.0s)]
*  She was embarrassed about it. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5047.0s)]
*  And then she saw how I went totally like fucking vulnerable. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5049.0s)]
*  And she was like, fuck it. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5052.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5055.0s)]
*  So there's so much more to it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5056.0s)]
*  But he ended up, I think it was last year or maybe this year, he OD'd. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5057.0s)]
*  So my mom divorced him, obviously, after it didn't work out. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5065.0s)]
*  And she would tell me a story one time. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5069.0s)]
*  We were talking about this book. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5070.0s)]
*  She started opening more up about the relationship with this prisoner. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5072.0s)]
*  And she said one night they got into a fight. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5077.0s)]
*  Not physical. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5080.0s)]
*  He never hit her like my dad did so many times. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5081.0s)]
*  But he said one night she was sleeping and had her back to him. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5085.0s)]
*  And all she thought about all fucking night was because she started slowly realizing like I'm fucked up. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5090.0s)]
*  Like I just married a fucking guy from prison that killed somebody. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5097.0s)]
*  And she started realizing it more and more. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5101.0s)]
*  But she's laying in bed. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5103.0s)]
*  And she was like, is this motherfucker going to fucking kill me tonight? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5104.0s)]
*  And she started telling me these fucking stories, man. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5109.0s)]
*  And I'm like, and I'm just like, what the fuck, man? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5113.0s)]
*  Like, you know, it was tough. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5118.0s)]
*  It was a tough way to grow up, man. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5122.0s)]
*  It was a tough way to grow up. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5124.0s)]
*  So yeah, he ended up, so they got divorced. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5125.0s)]
*  I think it worked maybe two years, whatever. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5128.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5131.0s)]
*  And then I think he OD'd last year. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5132.0s)]
*  He OD'd last year, killed himself. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5137.0s)]
*  I mean, he killed himself. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5139.0s)]
*  He's OD'd. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5141.0s)]
*  So the idea of you going off to boot camp knowing that your mom's going to be alone with this guy getting out of prison. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5151.0s)]
*  That shit must have been haunting. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5152.0s)]
*  It fucked me up every night. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5153.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5155.0s)]
*  Every night I'm sitting in the fucking in my bunk thinking. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5156.0s)]
*  And then I knew the date he was getting out of prison. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5159.0s)]
*  And like, you know, you can't just get on the phone and call, hey, mom, what's going on? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5163.0s)]
*  You know, no, you're in boot camp. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5166.0s)]
*  You get like every now and then they say, OK, you have like a phone call once a week or some shit. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5167.0s)]
*  I think every Sunday was a phone call. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5171.0s)]
*  And I'll never forget when he got to the house, man, I actually got I was fucking not right. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5174.0s)]
*  So I got recycled. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5181.0s)]
*  So a week in boot camp. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5183.0s)]
*  So like I fucking I don't know why I fucking did something boot camp and fucking got recycled. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5186.0s)]
*  I was sneaking the Snickers bars. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5190.0s)]
*  I was all kind of belligerent and shit. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5192.0s)]
*  I was just out of it. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5194.0s)]
*  I was sneaking out in this fucking I was just fucking not right. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5195.0s)]
*  I was wasn't right. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5199.0s)]
*  And so then I yeah, this is fucked up. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5201.0s)]
*  This is fucked up. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5205.0s)]
*  What was it like when you met him? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5206.0s)]
*  I try to be supportive because that's what I always did. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5208.0s)]
*  My mom, whatever made her happy. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5212.0s)]
*  I tried to that was my fucking number one priority was I never cared about myself. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5214.0s)]
*  Never, never, ever. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5219.0s)]
*  Which makes what I do now for people. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5223.0s)]
*  Yeah, I understand. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5227.0s)]
*  Because I care about people. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5230.0s)]
*  You know, my introvert, I'm an introvert, come my fucking life sucked. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5232.0s)]
*  But what I do for people, I really do. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5236.0s)]
*  That's why I want to make sure that fucking like that that fucking book and things I do. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5239.0s)]
*  That's why I don't fucking like why don't you sell shit? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5242.0s)]
*  Why don't you always know why aren't you like promoting this and that? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5245.0s)]
*  And no, man, no, I care that you understand that I fucking want to see you fucking kill shit. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5248.0s)]
*  I want to see you better. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5255.0s)]
*  So, you know, when I met him, I was supportive and I was and I sat back and looked at him. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5257.0s)]
*  And I wanted to fucking beat this motherfucker down so bad because I knew like you're not a good egg, bro. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5262.0s)]
*  You're not a good egg, man. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5268.0s)]
*  I'm not saying. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5269.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not saying prisoners are bad. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5270.0s)]
*  They can be rehabilitated. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5275.0s)]
*  But I always had these feelings about people. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5278.0s)]
*  If I get around you, I can fucking I mean, I tell you. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5282.0s)]
*  But when you grow up the way I grow up, man, you have this you have these ways of knowing pieces of shit. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5286.0s)]
*  I became an expert in pieces of shit. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5291.0s)]
*  I used to be one. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5295.0s)]
*  My dad was one. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5296.0s)]
*  So you can fucking pick him out. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5298.0s)]
*  You can pick out liars and all kind of car artists from a mile away because, motherfucker, I studied it. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5299.0s)]
*  Studied myself. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5305.0s)]
*  I know who you are. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5306.0s)]
*  So you can't come around me, bullshit me, man. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5307.0s)]
*  Can't. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5310.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5311.0s)]
*  So it was horrible. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5312.0s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5314.0s)]
*  So, you know, like the one woman I cared about more than anything in the world, because I saw her hell. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5316.0s)]
*  I'm looking at this shit now. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5322.0s)]
*  And now I have to go to fucking pair rescue school and all this other shit while she's fucking with this guy. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5324.0s)]
*  So there are a lot of things in my mind that that just made it hard that I studied. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5330.0s)]
*  I studied my mind during these times. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5336.0s)]
*  I started this process to become who I am today of learning life and how hard life is. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5338.0s)]
*  That's why I don't speak about the good times. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5345.0s)]
*  Everybody gets so mad. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5347.0s)]
*  Why do you speak about the good times? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5348.0s)]
*  I don't need to help you through those, brother. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5349.0s)]
*  I do not need to help you. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5352.0s)]
*  You don't turn on David Goggins for the good times. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5353.0s)]
*  You turn on David Goggins when you don't feel like doing shit. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5358.0s)]
*  You're an expert in dark matter. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5361.0s)]
*  Dark motherfucking matter. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5362.0s)]
*  That's what I am. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5364.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I know it really well. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5366.0s)]
*  So it wasn't like I wished for it. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5369.0s)]
*  One of the things that's hilarious in the book is that you read all the shit that people write to you, all the hate. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5373.0s)]
*  You record it and then you play back. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5382.0s)]
*  Brother, I want to tell you right now, man, that started honestly when this fucking SEAL from SEAL Team Six came out and started lying his fucking ass off about me. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5387.0s)]
*  This is an important subject. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5401.0s)]
*  We should talk about this because your military career and what you've done is always misrepresented. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5403.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5410.0s)]
*  Even by people that should know better. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5411.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5412.0s)]
*  Oh, they know better. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5413.0s)]
*  But what makes people feel good? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5414.0s)]
*  Like when you become successful, when you become successful, and I had to realize this and this guy made me realize this, I had to study them. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5416.0s)]
*  When you become successful, especially within a fraternity like that, like this is a fraternity, bro. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5425.0s)]
*  This isn't like a fucking like, oh, like in the Air Force, you know, this is a very different world. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5434.0s)]
*  So several SEALs, I'm going to say there's a lot that would like to see me fucking. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5440.0s)]
*  They like to see a lot of people not do well and them do great. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5446.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5449.0s)]
*  They all know we eat our own. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5450.0s)]
*  We eat our own. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5452.0s)]
*  We eat our own. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5453.0s)]
*  And that's what they all say. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5454.0s)]
*  We eat our own. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5455.0s)]
*  Is that all SEALs? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5456.0s)]
*  I don't know all SEALs. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5457.0s)]
*  A lot of SEALs. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5458.0s)]
*  I can't speak that way. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5459.0s)]
*  I know a few SEALs. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5460.0s)]
*  Is it just the hyper competitive nature of the type of people that get involved? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5465.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, we have this, this, this, this, this macho stigma that, you know, like, you know, we're, we're the best of the best. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5466.0s)]
*  We're fucking, we're the best motherfuckers in the world. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5474.0s)]
*  And I, I beg to differ. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5477.0s)]
*  You know, like people go, like I've had so many people in art, like the news. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5480.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5484.0s)]
*  They contact me all. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5485.0s)]
*  They want me so bad because there's been some things that came up, you know, Navy SEAL community. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5486.0s)]
*  This guy died. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5491.0s)]
*  This kid going through training died and some Navy SEALs. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5493.0s)]
*  I don't know the stories. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5497.0s)]
*  They can Google it. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5499.0s)]
*  Where the fuck? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5500.0s)]
*  I guess they killed somebody over in Iraq who has some information, some shit. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5501.0s)]
*  So they always want to get me on so I can fuck it. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5505.0s)]
*  Because they know that I was not a fan of a lot of Navy SEALs. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5508.0s)]
*  And a lot of it is to do with the lies, the fucking some of the leadership problems, some of the character issues. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5513.0s)]
*  And I got to see that a lot when I got out. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5520.0s)]
*  And I'm the one to say I had a lot of problems myself when I was growing up. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5523.0s)]
*  It took a long time for me to go. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5527.0s)]
*  So I'm not judging these people. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5529.0s)]
*  I know where this shit comes from, man. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5531.0s)]
*  The shit comes from shit you haven't handled. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5533.0s)]
*  So I it doesn't even bother me anymore. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5535.0s)]
*  But when I came out in 2018, this SEAL from SEAL Team 6, he had in Jennifer, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5539.0s)]
*  it pissed Jennifer off so fucking bad. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5549.0s)]
*  And I was cool about it. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5551.0s)]
*  But this guy started YouTube channels saying that I was dishonorably discharged. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5552.0s)]
*  I fucking was kicked out of the SEAL teams. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5557.0s)]
*  I refused to fight in combat. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5560.0s)]
*  I never went to combat. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5563.0s)]
*  I mean, every bit of it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5565.0s)]
*  So the reason why in my and can't hurt me, I have my write up of my medal from Iraq. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5567.0s)]
*  And I wasn't going to put that in there. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5575.0s)]
*  But Jennifer started getting DMs from people saying, do you know, I'm not going to name his name. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5577.0s)]
*  That's not who I am, dude. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5583.0s)]
*  And I just showed you outside about that one cat. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5584.0s)]
*  I'm not going to name his name either. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5587.0s)]
*  But I'm not going to name his name because how does he not know better, though? [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5589.0s)]
*  That's the that was one of the things that people bring up that you never deployed. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5592.0s)]
*  Right. Yep. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5598.0s)]
*  Why would they say that? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5599.0s)]
*  Why do you think, Joe? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5601.0s)]
*  Think about it, man. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5603.0s)]
*  Think about it. See, like this is something that's easily proven. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5605.0s)]
*  Exactly. But guess what? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5608.0s)]
*  This guy had black ops. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5610.0s)]
*  Literally, he was he was he had like YouTube channels, DM and people, because people like at this time, I started getting a little bigger. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5612.0s)]
*  I started getting a little more profile and he was coming out of the SEAL teams. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5619.0s)]
*  And I'm not going to say his name because I'm not going to try to take food out of his mouth. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5623.0s)]
*  And this is one thing I learned from all of this. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5627.0s)]
*  I had I was so fucking pissed, man. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5630.0s)]
*  I was so fucking pissed I didn't deploy. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5633.0s)]
*  I mean, the fucking lies were insane. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5635.0s)]
*  How many times did you deploy? [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5637.0s)]
*  Twice. One to Guam and one to Iraq. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5639.0s)]
*  And then what they don't talk about, though, is the reason I didn't deploy more is I had two heart surgeries. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5643.0s)]
*  So I was out of the fucking teams for deploying for like three, four years because the heart surgeries, because when you get a heart surgery, you can't go back to the point. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5648.0s)]
*  You were born with like holes in your heart. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5656.0s)]
*  Right. With a hole in my heart. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5658.0s)]
*  And the first surgery, it didn't, you know, it didn't take. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5659.0s)]
*  So I had to get another surgery. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5662.0s)]
*  So that took so much time having these heart surgeries. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5663.0s)]
*  So I was in recruiting at the time. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5666.0s)]
*  So this kept me in recruiting. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5669.0s)]
*  So this even added to the whole bullshit. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5671.0s)]
*  This added to the whole bullshit. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5674.0s)]
*  So they were loving it because right now, like I said, I wasn't like the most famous SEAL within the SEAL teams. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5676.0s)]
*  I didn't take shit, man. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5682.0s)]
*  If shit was fucked up, I called it. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5684.0s)]
*  I called it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5686.0s)]
*  There's no secret. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5687.0s)]
*  There's no secret shit here, man. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5688.0s)]
*  And I knew what happened when I got out and this guy started doing this shit. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5690.0s)]
*  And I knew why he was doing it because the biggest thing, like he wanted to take my character and destroy it. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5697.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5703.0s)]
*  That's what I wanted to do. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5704.0s)]
*  And so when you're in these kind of communities like this, man, people like, oh, no, there's no way he was trying to do that. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5705.0s)]
*  Man, I was saying, get Jennifer here right now. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5711.0s)]
*  We have all the screenshots and I had to get a fucking lawyer. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5714.0s)]
*  I mean, this guy went so far. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5718.0s)]
*  And then what happened was over a period of time, he fucking literally apologized, went away, fucking took all this shit down. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5720.0s)]
*  I mean, but he came out and but what happened was that rumor mill spread like wildfire. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5730.0s)]
*  Did he have to know? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5736.0s)]
*  Did he have to be told about your actual record? [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5738.0s)]
*  No, he knew it. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5741.0s)]
*  Never. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5742.0s)]
*  I deployed with him. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5743.0s)]
*  What? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5744.0s)]
*  I deployed with him in Iraq. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5745.0s)]
*  No. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5748.0s)]
*  In Iraq. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5749.0s)]
*  He was just lying. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5750.0s)]
*  In Iraq. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5751.0s)]
*  I deployed with him and the only fucking SEAL man you're going to give me the point where I say his fucking name because I swear to God. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5752.0s)]
*  So I deployed with his ass. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5758.0s)]
*  That's why I put the fucking write up in there. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5760.0s)]
*  So I got a medal over there in Iraq. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5763.0s)]
*  I got a medal in Iraq. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5766.0s)]
*  So I did go to war and I put it in the book because when Jennifer started getting all this shit and she goes, you got to put that fucking award in there because this motherfucker is just lying his ass off. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5767.0s)]
*  I didn't go to Ranger school. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5779.0s)]
*  All this shit. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5780.0s)]
*  So I put the Ranger school everything he said I put in can't hurt me because he was just literally lying trying to literally ruin who I was because I'm the world's toughest man. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5781.0s)]
*  That doesn't sit right with some fucking alpha motherfuckers dude. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5792.0s)]
*  And these motherfuckers do some of them. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5795.0s)]
*  And you don't know unless you've been in the fraternity like this. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5798.0s)]
*  Unless you've been in the fraternity like this you don't fucking know. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5802.0s)]
*  I don't fucking care about them. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5805.0s)]
*  There's some I have some great friends in there. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5806.0s)]
*  But anyway the reason this guy actually helped me out. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5809.0s)]
*  So when I came out there's a few guys in that came after me in the SEAL teams trying to make sure that I fucking wasn't going to be who I am. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5812.0s)]
*  And they still talk their bullshit lies. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5820.0s)]
*  Lies. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5823.0s)]
*  So many fucking lies dude. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5824.0s)]
*  It was great about is my proof is in can't hurt me. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5826.0s)]
*  So everything they say my proof is in and that's why it's designed that way for the liars. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5829.0s)]
*  But this guy came out and what I do is I studied him. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5834.0s)]
*  So Jennifer Gow lawyer about to sue the fuck out of this fucking guy man. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5838.0s)]
*  Like I had all this defamation. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5842.0s)]
*  I mean it was fucking a thick. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5843.0s)]
*  I was going to sue the fuck out of him. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5845.0s)]
*  And every night I fucking woke up. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5847.0s)]
*  I was like man I started thinking about myself. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5850.0s)]
*  And I was a piece of shit. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5853.0s)]
*  But I had no character. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5854.0s)]
*  And I had no pride no dignity. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5856.0s)]
*  That's because only people that do shit like that you're not a man. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5857.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5860.0s)]

*  Just trying to take another man down. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5871.0s)]
*  Just trying to take another man. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5872.0s)]
*  And not it'd be different if it was truth behind it. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5873.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5876.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5879.0s)]
*  Just because we didn't get along motherfucker it don't mean I wasn't who I am. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5880.0s)]
*  We didn't get along motherfucker because I fucking I'm like a lie detector. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5885.0s)]
*  Because I'm so fucking honest with myself. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5889.0s)]
*  I had such a hard time in my life that I fucking so forthright. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5891.0s)]
*  When you get even near me. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5894.0s)]
*  Because I fucking you know my shit is real. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5897.0s)]
*  It's fucking real as fuck. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5899.0s)]
*  It makes you feel bad. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5901.0s)]
*  If you got something going on in your fucking life I ain't going to open my fucking mouth. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5904.0s)]
*  You know my shit is fucking real. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5908.0s)]
*  Yeah I may not have deployed as many times as you motherfucker because my heart issues and the other issues that I won't talk about. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5910.0s)]
*  Because the fucking news wants me to fucking talk about this shit so bad. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5915.0s)]
*  They want to take some stills down so bad. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5918.0s)]
*  I ain't no bitch like that. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5920.0s)]
*  Whatever happened to the SEAL teams with me it happened to the SEAL teams. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5922.0s)]
*  That's why I don't fucking mention the names. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5925.0s)]
*  But I saw these little bitches come out here. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5927.0s)]
*  It was in the fraternity. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5929.0s)]
*  It happened in the fraternity. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5930.0s)]
*  Leave it there. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5931.0s)]
*  Don't be a fucking bitch come out here fucking spreading lies about me motherfucker. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5932.0s)]
*  But I studied all these little bitches who try to come out and ruin my life. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5936.0s)]
*  Studied all of them. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5939.0s)]
*  That man. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5941.0s)]
*  What you must be going through is fucking evil. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5943.0s)]
*  I even took it a step further. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5945.0s)]
*  I had to mature myself because I was so fucking mad. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5947.0s)]
*  And I looked at his family. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5950.0s)]
*  This guy who was talking this shit. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5951.0s)]
*  I'm going to say his name so bad but I never will. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5953.0s)]
*  Because that's a fucking bitch move on my part. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5955.0s)]
*  You could take food out of this fucking his family's mouth. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5959.0s)]
*  You're going to have this guy in a courthouse. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5962.0s)]
*  You can have him in the courtroom spending money on lawyers. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5964.0s)]
*  And I fucking just fucking dropped it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5969.0s)]
*  I said I'm good. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5971.0s)]
*  I said who the fuck I am. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5972.0s)]
*  I said you can wake up every fucking morning being the bitch that you are. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5974.0s)]
*  But I'm not going to fucking take money out of your pocket and money out of your mouth or out of your fucking kids mouth. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5978.0s)]
*  And this kid this guy wound up apologizing to him? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5983.0s)]
*  He didn't apologize to me. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5986.0s)]
*  What happened was he got on and I don't want to go too deep because they'll figure it out. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5988.0s)]
*  But he ended up basically saying he had a fucking he just wasn't he wasn't right in his head. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=5993.0s)]
*  He was he was you know he wasn't good. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6001.0s)]
*  And I can tell you wasn't good. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6004.0s)]
*  Because he was literally DMing people and I wish I had Jennifer in here so she can show you the DMs. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6005.0s)]
*  He was DMing people and talking all this shit and then he would delete it. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6010.0s)]
*  And this guy how so Jennifer found it. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6015.0s)]
*  And so because this guy DMed Jennifer and was like hey can you do you know this guy? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6019.0s)]
*  And I was like yeah I know him. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6025.0s)]
*  And then just like hey we got to fucking shut this shit down. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6027.0s)]
*  But he was DMing several people just saying that I was just on the discharge. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6030.0s)]
*  I was kicked out of the SEAL teams. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6035.0s)]
*  I refused to go to combat. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6037.0s)]
*  He just went on and on and on. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6039.0s)]
*  And so this guy was taking screenshots of what this guy was saying and sending them to us. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6041.0s)]
*  And so at this time now we have a lawyer. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6048.0s)]
*  And so we're getting all this shit dude and he had a YouTube site set up that he took down. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6050.0s)]
*  Just trying to literally ruin who I was. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6055.0s)]
*  And I looked at all this shit and I studied them. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6058.0s)]
*  And I was like man you got and what came out later on was he did have some demons. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6061.0s)]
*  He does have some demons. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6065.0s)]
*  Of course he does. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6067.0s)]
*  Serious demons. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6068.0s)]
*  That's how insane it is that the guy deployed with you. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6069.0s)]
*  SEAL team six and these motherfuckers supposed to be badass motherfuckers. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6072.0s)]
*  See this is some of the issues I had when I was in. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6076.0s)]
*  Is that when you work so hard man I put these motherfuckers I could talk about last time I was on this fucking shit. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6079.0s)]
*  On a pedestal. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6086.0s)]
*  Half the reason I ran on broken legs. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6087.0s)]
*  Half the reason why I fucking became who I became was because of the image these guys had on me. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6090.0s)]
*  I was so impressed with the books and the fucking and the people that they were. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6099.0s)]
*  I was like my god man I gotta be a fucking god. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6106.0s)]
*  I gotta be a god mentally to fucking get in here. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6109.0s)]
*  And once I got in I discovered something different. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6113.0s)]
*  I'm not saying everybody. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6116.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6118.0s)]
*  I don't know everybody in the SEAL teams. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6119.0s)]
*  But I had a problem with the fact that a lot of people lived this shit. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6121.0s)]
*  Like a lot of the civilians like oh my god the SEALs are this the SEALs are that. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6128.0s)]
*  You were able to run Badwater 135 because you're a Navy SEAL. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6132.0s)]
*  And because they. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6137.0s)]
*  Like no motherfucker. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6138.0s)]
*  That ain't why. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6140.0s)]
*  And I always knew the shit. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6141.0s)]
*  And I had issues with it man. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6142.0s)]
*  I had issues with it. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6144.0s)]
*  So I had a fucking lot of issues with it. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6145.0s)]
*  A lot of people didn't like that. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6146.0s)]
*  And then I went on to go on recruiting for a little bit. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6147.0s)]
*  And then the heart surgery just happened. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6150.0s)]
*  So the more I was in recruiting the more that shit happened. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6152.0s)]
*  They just started slowly building up lies. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6155.0s)]
*  Slowly building up lies. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6158.0s)]
*  And I came out to who I was. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6159.0s)]
*  I told Jennifer. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6161.0s)]
*  And I knew it. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6162.0s)]
*  I said stand by. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6164.0s)]
*  Stand by. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6166.0s)]
*  It's coming. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6167.0s)]
*  Whenever you're a person that gets what other people think is attention that they think [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6168.0s)]
*  they deserve. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6173.0s)]
*  Yes sir. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6174.0s)]
*  That's when things get weird. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6175.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6176.0s)]
*  That's why they bring those fucking deployments. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6177.0s)]
*  Because they think oh my god you didn't deploy as much as me. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6178.0s)]
*  You didn't deploy as much as me. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6180.0s)]
*  He's not known for being for deploying and shit. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6181.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6185.0s)]
*  Motherfuckers don't care. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6186.0s)]
*  Yeah I have a combat deployment and I deployed another time that we were supposed to. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6187.0s)]
*  It was right during 9-11. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6191.0s)]
*  We were supposed to go and they fucking had us over there. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6193.0s)]
*  We were all pissed off. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6195.0s)]
*  Didn't work out that way. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6196.0s)]
*  But I got over there. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6197.0s)]
*  And what's funny about it. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6198.0s)]
*  This is what makes me laugh so much. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6199.0s)]
*  There's a lot of Navy soldiers who never deployed over combat ever. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6200.0s)]
*  Ever. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6203.0s)]
*  And it makes me laugh because motherfuckers want to act like one combat deployment where [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6204.0s)]
*  I fought for my fucking country is bullshit. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6210.0s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6214.0s)]
*  Fought for my fucking country. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6215.0s)]
*  Did my shit. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6217.0s)]
*  And I got there. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6218.0s)]
*  And I got there. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6219.0s)]
*  And I got there. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6220.0s)]
*  And I got there. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6221.0s)]
*  And I got there. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6222.0s)]
*  And I got there. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6223.0s)]
*  And I did my shit. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6224.0s)]
*  Sorry it worked out the way it worked out. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6225.0s)]
*  And that's not enough. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6228.0s)]
*  I think part of the problem with some of those guys is when guys are seriously alpha and [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6232.0s)]
*  they think they go above and beyond and they push harder than anybody and then they meet [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6238.0s)]
*  you. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6244.0s)]
*  And you're the guy that's getting up at 3.30 in the morning yelling at them while you're [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6245.0s)]
*  running. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6249.0s)]
*  Like I know you're sleeping. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6250.0s)]
*  I know you're still in bed. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6251.0s)]
*  Motherfucker. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6252.0s)]
*  You're out here running 10 miles before you eat breakfast. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6253.0s)]
*  That's half the reason I did it. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6257.0s)]
*  That's half the reason that motherfuckers going to fucking Jalisco's and shit. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6258.0s)]
*  Getting waffle breakfast and fucking bacon and eggs and shit. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6260.0s)]
*  That bothered me. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6264.0s)]
*  I said motherfucker I got my family and everybody thinking I'm some fucking stud. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6265.0s)]
*  And you all just got to fucking lift some weights. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6269.0s)]
*  You all don't want to fucking like I said I was in charge of PT. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6271.0s)]
*  And they're like no this ain't Bud's Goggins. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6275.0s)]
*  Like man you got a lot of motherfuckers food. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6279.0s)]
*  I ain't saying everybody. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6281.0s)]
*  I don't know every seal. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6282.0s)]
*  I don't know every seal. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6283.0s)]
*  But you want to run your fucking mouth about me and talk your little shit. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6284.0s)]
*  I got my secrets too and I won't say names because only your bitch does that. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6287.0s)]
*  So keep on running your fucking mouths. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6292.0s)]
*  I know all you motherfuckers. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6294.0s)]
*  So you started taking over PT. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6296.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6298.0s)]
*  So when I got back I went on my first deployment and when I came back off my first deployment [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6299.0s)]
*  I begged. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6305.0s)]
*  Put seven chits in. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6306.0s)]
*  Seven chits. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6308.0s)]
*  It's like a request shit to go to Ranger school. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6309.0s)]
*  Motherfuckers don't request to go to Ranger school. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6312.0s)]
*  I wanted to go to Ranger school. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6315.0s)]
*  As a seal you went through Bud's whatever the fuck. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6316.0s)]
*  You don't want to go to another course to get your ass kicked. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6319.0s)]
*  I did. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6322.0s)]
*  I did. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6323.0s)]
*  So when Ranger school came back, honor man. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6324.0s)]
*  I was the enlisted honor man at Ranger school. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6326.0s)]
*  But they say I'm a bad operator. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6328.0s)]
*  They also say I'm a bad operator. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6330.0s)]
*  But guess what they had my black ass when I was fucking in Iraq. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6331.0s)]
*  I was charged. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6335.0s)]
*  It was called PSD. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6336.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6338.0s)]
*  So you're like a bodyguard. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6339.0s)]
*  I'm a bad operator Joe. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6340.0s)]
*  But guess where I was. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6342.0s)]
*  I was the lead navigator. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6344.0s)]
*  So I'm the eyes. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6347.0s)]
*  So everything we did was in the car. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6349.0s)]
*  It was my job to make sure that whole fucking platoon was safe. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6351.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6355.0s)]
*  You're not going to put a dumb bad operator up there who's fucking not good. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6356.0s)]
*  It was my job to make sure I called all the outs. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6360.0s)]
*  Called all the trouble coming. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6362.0s)]
*  Had to get us there safe. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6364.0s)]
*  We had a fucking guy who was going for the prime minister's job who we were guarding. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6365.0s)]
*  And they had a bad operator, what they want to call me. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6370.0s)]
*  They wanted to hear these little fucking rumors. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6374.0s)]
*  I was the guy who led it. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6376.0s)]
*  And it was so good. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6378.0s)]
*  I did such a good job that there was two of us because the job is very stressful. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6379.0s)]
*  Being a primary navigator is stressful. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6382.0s)]
*  So they have a primary and a secondary. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6384.0s)]
*  So some days I would do it. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6386.0s)]
*  Some days another guy would do it. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6387.0s)]
*  I was doing such a good job Joe that they didn't want the other guy to do it. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6389.0s)]
*  So I became the only guy navigating us through fucking Iraq. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6393.0s)]
*  Alright. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6398.0s)]
*  And our guy didn't live in the green zone. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6399.0s)]
*  The green zone is a safe place. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6401.0s)]
*  Our guy lived in the red zone. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6402.0s)]
*  So we had to go out in the red zone every day to get this fucking guy. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6404.0s)]
*  Bring him back in. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6407.0s)]
*  No, there was no shoot him ups because this one rumor that was out there that came out from this guy was I froze. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6409.0s)]
*  I froze in a firefight. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6416.0s)]
*  It's kind of funny how you can freeze in a firefight when our platoon was never in morning. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6418.0s)]
*  So it's just bullshit man. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6424.0s)]
*  But I know where it comes from. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6427.0s)]
*  I know where it comes from. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6429.0s)]
*  Crabs in a bucket. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6430.0s)]
*  I know where it comes from my friend. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6431.0s)]
*  It's just crabs in a bucket. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6432.0s)]
*  Sorry I became so successful guys. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6433.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6436.0s)]
*  People don't like it when you did the same thing they did. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6437.0s)]
*  You come from the same fraternity but you get exorbitant amounts of attention and success. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6440.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6445.0s)]
*  And instead of looking at that and going wow look what he did. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6446.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6449.0s)]
*  I wish I did that or maybe I could do more or he's inspiring other people and that's great. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6450.0s)]
*  You know what though I will say this. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6457.0s)]
*  There's a lot of them that do say that. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6459.0s)]
*  That's great. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6461.0s)]
*  There's a lot of them that do say this. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6462.0s)]
*  I have this guy named Hawk. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6463.0s)]
*  You know that the email I sent to you a while ago about this guy who wrote that email about the SEAL teams. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6464.0s)]
*  And I shared it with you about he's talking about like only 13 percent of you actually. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6472.0s)]
*  It's like anyway I sent you an email. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6476.0s)]
*  Yeah I remember. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6479.0s)]
*  So anyway he's a guy that sent that email Hawk. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6480.0s)]
*  He's like my best friend. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6483.0s)]
*  So he bad motherfucker. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6484.0s)]
*  When he got on the SEAL teams he wrote this email and sent it out to like every Navy SEAL. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6487.0s)]
*  And it was like eighty seven percent of you motherfuckers. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6492.0s)]
*  He said eighty seven percent of you motherfuckers you know are living off of one week. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6495.0s)]
*  And what he was talking about was hell week. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6501.0s)]
*  Like that one week in hell week is all they're living off of because they're not living it now. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6503.0s)]
*  And he made these shirts called the 13 percent shirts. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6507.0s)]
*  And the other 13 percent guys are actually getting after it. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6511.0s)]
*  That motherfucker sent me two of them. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6514.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6517.0s)]
*  He sent me two of them. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6518.0s)]
*  So yeah they're right. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6519.0s)]
*  I wish I could deploy more and blah blah blah whatever and whatever man. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6521.0s)]
*  But I was a fucking good SEAL and fucking good teammate. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6525.0s)]
*  And some guys didn't like me in the fraternity. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6530.0s)]
*  We fucking had it out. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6532.0s)]
*  And there was a time somebody fucking did some shit. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6534.0s)]
*  But it is what it is man. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6536.0s)]
*  You ever heard when people talk about some union work. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6537.0s)]
*  One of the things that happens when you're in some unions is like if you're working too hard someone will come along go hey David. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6541.0s)]
*  Slow the fuck down. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6547.0s)]
*  That's a true statement. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6549.0s)]
*  Like you're moving too many packages. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6550.0s)]
*  You're doing too much of this. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6552.0s)]
*  Doing too much of that. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6553.0s)]
*  You're setting the standard too high and you're fucking it up for everybody else. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6555.0s)]
*  And so you'll have people that will sabotage someone just because that person wants to work hard. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6558.0s)]
*  Oh I see it. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6564.0s)]
*  But it made me grow. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6565.0s)]
*  It made me grow. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6567.0s)]
*  And I'm glad I didn't put a case on that guy. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6568.0s)]
*  And I'm glad I got a chance to study him. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6570.0s)]
*  And it is what it is man. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6573.0s)]
*  It is what it is. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6575.0s)]
*  And this is one part that I try to tell people and teach them. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6576.0s)]
*  If you're trying to go to that uncommon amongst the uncommon place. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6578.0s)]
*  It's a lonely motherfucker up there man. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6583.0s)]
*  It's lonely. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6586.0s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm better than every fucking body. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6587.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6588.0s)]
*  And once again I'm not speaking for every seal. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6589.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6592.0s)]
*  But I just didn't. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6593.0s)]
*  I didn't try to be what they were. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6594.0s)]
*  What you're just saying is just a fact. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6597.0s)]
*  It's just a fact. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6599.0s)]
*  It's just a fact. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6600.0s)]
*  And there there's people that are willing to go very far. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6601.0s)]
*  And then there's people that are willing to go far further than that. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6604.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6607.0s)]
*  And when your person who prides yourself on your ability to go very far. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6608.0s)]
*  And then someone is willing to go far farther than you. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6612.0s)]
*  You have to decide. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6615.0s)]
*  Do I want to look at that as the new standard? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6617.0s)]
*  Do I want to judge myself? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6620.0s)]
*  Do I want to admire him? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6622.0s)]
*  Or do I want to try to take him down? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6624.0s)]
*  Because I feel bad. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6626.0s)]
*  Because I can't do what he does or haven't done what he does. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6627.0s)]
*  Or what he does makes me look bad. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6630.0s)]
*  Because I like to think I'm a hard worker. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6633.0s)]
*  I could think I'm disciplined and hard. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6635.0s)]
*  And then I see this fucking dude out there that just making me look soft. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6637.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6640.0s)]
*  And so instead of just going look at a man. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6641.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6644.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6645.0s)]
*  Instead of a smart person will look at that person as fuel. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6646.0s)]
*  But you have to make your own decisions too. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6649.0s)]
*  Because what you do requires a dedication that will eliminate a lot of things from your life that some people enjoy and think are important. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6652.0s)]
*  And also when I took the road, because I knew what I was doing. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6662.0s)]
*  When you take that road and you just don't want to just fit in. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6667.0s)]
*  It's a lonely road. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6671.0s)]
*  It's a lonely road and you get a lot of haters man. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6673.0s)]
*  Like I tell people all the time man. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6675.0s)]
*  If I can walk on water motherfuckers will say because I couldn't swim. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6677.0s)]
*  I'll tell you that right the fuck now. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6683.0s)]
*  I'll tell you that right now. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6685.0s)]
*  And this is a true statement. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6686.0s)]
*  I used to get so mad like I said about this fucking shit man. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6688.0s)]
*  I sat back one day and I was like you know what? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6691.0s)]
*  All these people are hating on me man. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6693.0s)]
*  Like I have a guy who's trying to write a book saying that I was telling people. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6695.0s)]
*  He's a famous author. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6699.0s)]
*  Like I don't have a drop name. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6700.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to hurt your business but you're funny. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6701.0s)]
*  These people are funny. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6703.0s)]
*  Keep on talking your shit. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6705.0s)]
*  I will absorb it and make a mixtape out of your fucking ass. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6706.0s)]
*  Like I do. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6709.0s)]
*  He tried to tell. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6710.0s)]
*  He was going to write a book that I was telling people to run until your kidneys got fucked up. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6711.0s)]
*  My mentality of running is I was telling people to run until your kidneys got fucked up. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6719.0s)]
*  So run until you get rabdo. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6724.0s)]
*  Run until you get rabdo. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6726.0s)]
*  He was going to write a book and the premise was the way I think compared to the way he thinks. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6727.0s)]
*  I never told a motherfucker in my life I'd tell you to do better and go as far as you can. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6734.0s)]
*  I don't tell you to go until you fucking kill yourself. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6741.0s)]
*  Until you get rabdo. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6744.0s)]
*  But I will tell you this, Joe. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6746.0s)]
*  You will never, never in life meet a hater doing better than you. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6748.0s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6754.0s)]
*  Ever. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6756.0s)]
*  So when I fucking realized that and Jennifer gets so mad at the lies she hears and this and that because it comes all through. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6757.0s)]
*  They spew it. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6763.0s)]
*  I told Jennifer that shit, man. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6764.0s)]
*  Stop. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6767.0s)]
*  Fucking calm down, bro. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6768.0s)]
*  Don't stop sending me that shit. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6769.0s)]
*  100% factual. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6770.0s)]
*  We were talking about in the bathroom earlier. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6772.0s)]
*  I was like you got a amount of bandwidth in your mind. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6775.0s)]
*  Whatever those units are, let's call it 100. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6778.0s)]
*  100 of those things in your mind. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6781.0s)]
*  The moment you start entertaining haters, you start reading comments, you're stealing your bandwidth. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6783.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6790.0s)]
*  That you could apply to your loved ones. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6791.0s)]
*  That you could apply to the thing that you love to do. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6793.0s)]
*  That you could apply to making your life better. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6795.0s)]
*  You're stealing from yourself when you pay attention. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6798.0s)]
*  Like I was talking about, man, clearing that space out. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6801.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6803.0s)]
*  And that space allows you to make more room for what's important in your life. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6804.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6807.0s)]
*  If your mind's still cluttered, man, you can't do shit. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6808.0s)]
*  There's also a thing about you being a public person. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6810.0s)]
*  Being a public person, now you have access to way more haters than the average. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6812.0s)]
*  The average person knows a few haters. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6818.0s)]
*  Maybe if you're a good looking woman and you got some bitches in the office that like to talk shit about you. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6820.0s)]
*  Or if you're a guy who's like getting after it early and being disciplined and you make people intimidated by your ambition. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6825.0s)]
*  You're going to have some haters. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6833.0s)]
*  You're going to have people lying about you. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6834.0s)]
*  There's going to be, but you have no idea what it's like to be a public person like yourself. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6836.0s)]
*  And the kind of haters that you must experience. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6843.0s)]
*  Because if you paid attention to them all day long, you would have no time for anything else. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6846.0s)]
*  No, I never get in 2013 when I was first, you know, Jennifer knows about this shit. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6851.0s)]
*  I cussed everybody. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6856.0s)]
*  We had this fucking round table. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6858.0s)]
*  Everybody was like, man, you have such a great story. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6859.0s)]
*  You need to tell it. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6862.0s)]
*  You need to get on social media and blah, blah, blah. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6863.0s)]
*  I cussed everybody out. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6865.0s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6866.0s)]
*  I'm not fucking going on that fucking shit. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6867.0s)]
*  That's a bunch of bullshit. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6870.0s)]
*  Fucking lying. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6871.0s)]
*  It's the devil. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6872.0s)]
*  And the second I fucking got on that shit, dude, it is the fucking devil. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6873.0s)]
*  Instagram and social media, man. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6879.0s)]
*  I had this fucking kid, man, who fucking literally, the reason I talk about haters so much is this little boy. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6882.0s)]
*  His parents reached out to me. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6888.0s)]
*  He was getting so much hate at school and we get so many emails, I can't check them all. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6890.0s)]
*  And but I get to them. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6895.0s)]
*  But later on, much like two or three months later, so this guy wrote us and this kid was having a hard time with bullies. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6898.0s)]
*  And when I got to his email, I got to it, called his family up, say, what's going on? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6906.0s)]
*  You know, David Goggers, they were all happy to hear it. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6910.0s)]
*  He had killed himself. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6913.0s)]
*  So like I in the back of my fucking mind and what hurt me the most was when I read the fucking email. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6915.0s)]
*  You know, whoo shit. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6926.0s)]
*  I get my shit together. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6928.0s)]
*  I wasn't going to bring this shit up. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6929.0s)]
*  Yeah, I read the email and they said he can you know, you can help our son. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6933.0s)]
*  You know, our son really admires you. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6938.0s)]
*  And that's why I am so I'm very vocal for a lot of reasons. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6940.0s)]
*  But I have to be strong because I know people aren't. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6946.0s)]
*  So, you know, that's why I don't cower from shit. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6950.0s)]
*  You know, at all. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6954.0s)]
*  You want to fucking, you know, I'll take on whatever whatever challenges in front of me. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6955.0s)]
*  I take it on because a lot of people don't have that that courage and it's hard to be brave. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6960.0s)]
*  It's fucking hard to speak up for what you believe in. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6964.0s)]
*  And they wrote this great email to me and they want me to talk to their son. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6967.0s)]
*  Son was a big follower of mine. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6973.0s)]
*  And so I called. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6975.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it was silent, very silent pause. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6978.0s)]
*  And they told me what happened. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6983.0s)]
*  And he hung himself. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6985.0s)]
*  And I was like, it was fucked up. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6987.0s)]
*  So, you know, that's what another reason I hate. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6990.0s)]
*  I hate being a public figure because it's not a public figure that I am. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6993.0s)]
*  Like, it's funny. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=6998.0s)]
*  I hang around some people who are real public figures, you know, like celebrities. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7001.0s)]
*  And I have people come into me first. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7005.0s)]
*  Like I'm some famous motherfuckers. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7008.0s)]
*  And people come to me first and and they want to share their story in their life with me about how they changed. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7011.0s)]
*  And that's a massive responsibility that people don't understand. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7019.0s)]
*  Like they come to you and they share the demons that they've gone through and the hardships that they've gone through. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7022.0s)]
*  And they say you and your book and what you've done in your social media page. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7030.0s)]
*  That's why I make sure I want to go at people so hard, Joe, sometimes for fucking talking their shit to me, man, and lying and shit. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7036.0s)]
*  I make sure that my social media only has like, let's fucking get it today. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7043.0s)]
*  Let's fucking get it. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7049.0s)]
*  I go, man, why don't you follow me by it? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7051.0s)]
*  Man, I'm not into that shit, dude. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7053.0s)]
*  I want you fuckers to understand, dude, I'm your biggest fuck. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7055.0s)]
*  For you who aren't bitching and whining and complaining, I'm your biggest fucking cheerleader. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7059.0s)]
*  I want to see you do great. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7065.0s)]
*  And a lot of that shit comes from that fucking email from that kid who killed himself. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7067.0s)]
*  That I got to like two or three months too late. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7071.0s)]
*  And that fucking shit every day I fucking wake up. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7074.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, man. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7076.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7078.0s)]
*  I got to be honest. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7079.0s)]
*  I got to be right. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7080.0s)]
*  I got to be better. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7081.0s)]
*  And that's that's when you know that when you're trying to do your best, your life sucks. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7082.0s)]
*  And people don't get that. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7089.0s)]
*  When you're trying to have the best character, you try not to fucking lie, you're trying not to fucking put people down. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7090.0s)]
*  You're trying to live. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7096.0s)]
*  You're trying to set the standard. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7097.0s)]
*  When you're trying to be the standard and that's there is you know, there's so much going wrong and going off in this world. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7099.0s)]
*  If people can focus on themselves being better versus throwing hate and fucking all this shit that happens out there and people talking shit. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7106.0s)]
*  I won't miss no motherfuckers names. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7114.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to hurt you, man. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7116.0s)]
*  But I'm trying to be the standard. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7118.0s)]
*  And sometimes life is just not fun when you're like, can't do that. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7120.0s)]
*  Can't say that. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7125.0s)]
*  Got to watch out for that. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7126.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to wake up today. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7128.0s)]
*  I got it. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7130.0s)]
*  I got a grind because there may be a motherfucker that sees me in their fucking car that says, all right, I'm gonna go home and be better today. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7131.0s)]
*  So all these things in my fucking mind, every fucking day I wake up every fucking day. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7137.0s)]
*  And I, you know, so, you know, I try to get the email. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7142.0s)]
*  It's me and Jennifer. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7146.0s)]
*  But yeah, you know, people fucking this is crazy, man. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7148.0s)]
*  People come with me and tell me their stories, man. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7152.0s)]
*  This fucking very humbling that this kid that came from fucking nothing is now helping people who, you know, like, you know, this is funny and people call me crazy a lot. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7153.0s)]
*  You're so fucking crazy, but what you do now look at him straight in the eye and say, man, I'm not crazy. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7164.0s)]
*  I'm just not you. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7170.0s)]
*  I'm just not who you are, who you want to be. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7172.0s)]
*  I have a responsibility, man. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7174.0s)]
*  And I got to fucking take that seriously. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7176.0s)]
*  Well, people like to look at people that are pushing further than them and harder than them. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7178.0s)]
*  There's something wrong with you. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7182.0s)]
*  Yep. You must be crazy. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7184.0s)]
*  I'd be crazy. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7186.0s)]
*  I love crazy, though. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7188.0s)]
*  My favorite people are crazy. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7190.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7192.0s)]
*  But I don't look at it as a negative. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7193.0s)]
*  No, I look at it as a strength. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7195.0s)]
*  It is. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7197.0s)]
*  I see a person who's willing to go to that dark matter place. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7198.0s)]
*  I go, oh, I like that. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7201.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7202.0s)]
*  I like that. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7203.0s)]
*  But you went there during Sober October, man. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7204.0s)]
*  You went there. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7206.0s)]
*  You went there. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7207.0s)]
*  So how did that feel, man, when you fucking were going into those journeys, into those compartments? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7208.0s)]
*  Well, what I like about it is that you had to do it every day. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7212.0s)]
*  You know, and so I just every day would, you know, know it was coming. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7215.0s)]
*  I'll go, hey, all right, here we go. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7221.0s)]
*  Time to get going. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7223.0s)]
*  And every day just get after it in some crazy way. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7224.0s)]
*  One of my favorite things is the thing that I hate the most. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7228.0s)]
*  It's air dine sprints. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7231.0s)]
*  I do those Tabata sprints on the air dine machine. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7233.0s)]
*  Oh, the fucking Echo bike. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7236.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Echo bike from Rogue. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7239.0s)]
*  20 second sprints, 10 second rest. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7240.0s)]
*  And you do cycles of eight. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7242.0s)]
*  So eight rounds of that. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7244.0s)]
*  And then I would do another one and another one and another one. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7245.0s)]
*  I was doing an hour at that. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7248.0s)]
*  That's fucking brutal, bro. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7250.0s)]
*  It's so hard. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7252.0s)]
*  But when it was done, I'm standing in a puddle. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7253.0s)]
*  I'm completely drenched. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7257.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7259.0s)]
*  I love the feeling of getting through this because the last cycles when you're doing like, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7260.0s)]
*  and you look like the Rogue bike will show you like you've done three, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7266.0s)]
*  which means you have to you have to do five more of these sprints. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7270.0s)]
*  And that 10 seconds is non-existent. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7273.0s)]
*  And then Tekken is like, deet, deet, deet. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7275.0s)]
*  It's so quick. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7281.0s)]
*  And then you're back at it again. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7282.0s)]
*  Those last ones are so hard. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7284.0s)]
*  But when you get through it, the rest of the day is so much better. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7286.0s)]
*  That's like fight training, man. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7289.0s)]
*  Because the month of November, all I've been doing is drinking. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7290.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7293.0s)]
*  Oh, man. I've been working out. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7294.0s)]
*  Still working out. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7295.0s)]
*  But we're doing a lot of drinking. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7296.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I got to stop. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7298.0s)]
*  So I woke up today because today's December 1st. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7300.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not drinking this month. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7302.0s)]
*  I'll have a glass of wine on Christmas or something like that. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7304.0s)]
*  But this month, I'm back to the grind. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7306.0s)]
*  Are you? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7308.0s)]
*  Because yeah, yeah, because I enjoyed October. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7309.0s)]
*  The suck, when it's over, it's life is better. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7312.0s)]
*  You just got to get through the suck and then life is better. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7318.0s)]
*  But the thing that gets me is the level of I don't give a fuck, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7321.0s)]
*  the lack of anxiety that comes after you work out every day is so worth the workout. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7327.0s)]
*  You're so calm. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7334.0s)]
*  So calm. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7336.0s)]
*  The only thing that changes your fucking DNA is discipline. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7337.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7341.0s)]
*  Discipline is the only thing that changes your DNA, man. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7342.0s)]
*  This is the only thing. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7344.0s)]
*  Only thing, man. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7345.0s)]
*  I'm so fucked up. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7346.0s)]
*  And I realized that, man. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7347.0s)]
*  I was like, man, the only thing that changed my DNA is discipline. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7348.0s)]
*  I've incorporated a new thing that I was telling you where I get up first thing in the morning, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7353.0s)]
*  I get in the cold plunge because I was doing the cold plunge after I did the sauna. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7357.0s)]
*  And it's a little easier because the sauna sucks. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7361.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7364.0s)]
*  But, you know, when that 20 minutes is up or 25 minutes is up and then you get in that cold, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7365.0s)]
*  the cold sucks, but it doesn't suck as much as when you're cold. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7369.0s)]
*  And then you get in the cold. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7373.0s)]
*  So when I wake up in the morning, I don't dress warm. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7375.0s)]
*  I wear my fucking underwear and I go outside. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7378.0s)]
*  It's 40 degrees this morning. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7380.0s)]
*  And I walk out and I lift the lid on that Morosgo cold plunge and I see the fucking ice floating up in there. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7382.0s)]
*  And every day I climb in. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7388.0s)]
*  That's brutal. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7390.0s)]
*  And I just get in there for three minutes in the morning and then I work out. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7391.0s)]
*  That's fucking brutal. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7394.0s)]
*  Well, because I read this thing. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7395.0s)]
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7397.0s)]
*  But I read this thing where they've been doing studies on what happens to people. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7399.0s)]
*  Andrew Huberman and I actually discussed this. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7405.0s)]
*  And Huberman's a very interesting guy. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7408.0s)]
*  But it's about the benefits of cold plunge before you actually work out. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7410.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7419.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7420.0s)]
*  Because there's a benefit after you work out in terms of reduction of inflammation. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7421.0s)]
*  But what they're saying is you shouldn't do it right after you lift weights. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7425.0s)]
*  Got it. Got it. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7429.0s)]
*  Because then it actually decreases the hypertrophy. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7430.0s)]
*  So you don't gain as much mass or gain as much strength. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7435.0s)]
*  But there's some benefit to doing it before you work out. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7439.0s)]
*  I think there's a link involved in that too. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7443.0s)]
*  So anyway, this is a guy who's talking about prostate-specific antigen blood tests came back very high. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7448.0s)]
*  And everyone said that he had to get a biopsy. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7458.0s)]
*  And he said, the story I've heard about older men getting biopsies and prostatectomies sounded like nightmares to him. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7461.0s)]
*  So he decided to try to manage his PSA with ketosis and ice baths. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7468.0s)]
*  So it worked. His PSA dropped from over seven to less than one. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7473.0s)]
*  And along the way, a funny thing happened to his testosterone. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7478.0s)]
*  It went through the roof to 1140, which is crazy high. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7481.0s)]
*  He said, my urologist didn't believe me. He thought I must be juicing. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7486.0s)]
*  So he had my luteinizing hormones tested too. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7490.0s)]
*  Sure enough, 8.9 is off the charts for a fat guy in his 50s. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7492.0s)]
*  He said, then I did a research and discovered a Japanese study from 1991 that showed the secret was exercising after your ice bath. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7498.0s)]
*  It's the opposite of what everybody says to do, which is exactly how I got this far in the first place. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7506.0s)]
*  He said, now I'm stuck with the T levels of an over-sexed 19-year-old. I'm not complaining. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7512.0s)]
*  Damn. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7517.0s)]
*  So this is the thing that people are realizing now. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7518.0s)]
*  There's some extreme benefit to heavy duty cold exposure. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7522.0s)]
*  And then you force your body to heat up and then you work out. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7531.0s)]
*  So I'm trying that now and I've only done it three days in a row. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7539.0s)]
*  How's it working? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7543.0s)]
*  It's working. It's hard. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7544.0s)]
*  But part of it is just the fact that you have to do it in the morning. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7547.0s)]
*  I'm not giving myself any morning's off. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7551.0s)]
*  So that's how I start my day now. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7553.0s)]
*  Whereas before I was working out, so I eased myself into the workout, get on the bike, warm up, jump a little rope, start the kettlebell routine, do all the things you gotta do. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7555.0s)]
*  But now it's just right into the suck. So it's harder. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7565.0s)]
*  I tell you right now, man, the fucking cold, being in cold water, cold ice water, it literally is the one thing that makes you question everything. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7569.0s)]
*  When you're going through hard training and shit like that. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7580.0s)]
*  I've been through a lot of different training in the military and that cold water, it definitely, many dreams die while suffering. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7582.0s)]
*  That should be a t-shirt. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7593.0s)]
*  Many dreams die while suffering, my friend. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7594.0s)]
*  That's so true. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7596.0s)]
*  When you talk about it, man, like this fucking God's getting that water and you see their fucking eyes roll back. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7597.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, many dreams die while suffering, friend. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7602.0s)]
*  I was trying to talk to Jamie about it. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7607.0s)]
*  Jamie. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7609.0s)]
*  It's fucking cold. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7610.0s)]
*  I'll do cold. It's just like there's a level of cold. I want to ease myself into it. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7612.0s)]
*  I don't want to just start in the worst. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7617.0s)]
*  That might be the best way to do it, Jamie. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7619.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I've been telling him. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7621.0s)]
*  You just gotta jump in that bitch. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7622.0s)]
*  I just couldn't go below my knees. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7624.0s)]
*  Just get his feet cold in there. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7627.0s)]
*  Once that pecker gets cold, boy, it's real. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7629.0s)]
*  I know. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7632.0s)]
*  It's all real. I go right up to the chin. I want that water right there. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7633.0s)]
*  That's legit right there, man. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7637.0s)]
*  If it's real legit, you go under. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7639.0s)]
*  Hicks and Gracie, he puts a snorkel on. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7641.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7643.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hicks and gets in that water for a couple minutes under the water with the snorkel on. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7644.0s)]
*  He likes that shit, huh? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7648.0s)]
*  Hicks and is an intense motherfucker. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7649.0s)]
*  Speaking of that, who's the best ever? [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7651.0s)]
*  Oh, the best ever in MMA? [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7655.0s)]
*  Ever in MMA. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7658.0s)]
*  It's hard to say. There's a lot of candidates. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7659.0s)]
*  I've always said Mighty Mouse is one of my best bets because he was so goddamn good, and he's still so goddamn good. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7663.0s)]
*  But now he's fighting in one FC, but he was a flyweight champion for a long time. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7669.0s)]
*  He was the highest level of expression of mixed martial arts ability that I've ever seen. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7673.0s)]
*  But he's also fighting guys that are much lighter. They're 125 pounds. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7680.0s)]
*  Everyone's very quick, but he was just so skillful. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7684.0s)]
*  But then there's John Jones. John Jones really never lost. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7688.0s)]
*  That's the nasty motherfucker. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7692.0s)]
*  He's a nasty motherfucker, and really, John Jones fucked off. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7694.0s)]
*  You want to talk about a guy who just did it by talent and will? [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7697.0s)]
*  John Jones beat Alexander Gustafson without training. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7702.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7705.0s)]
*  He basically didn't train. There's a few guys like that. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7706.0s)]
*  There's a guy named Ryan Spann who's out there right now who just fucked up Dominic Reyes. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7708.0s)]
*  Dominic Reyes was the one guy who took John Jones to the limit. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7712.0s)]
*  Dominic Reyes went on a series of losses after that fight, but he had this fight with John Jones and took John Jones to the fucking limit. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7716.0s)]
*  A lot of people thought he won that decision. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7726.0s)]
*  Then he went on after that fight, got knocked out by Jan Blachowicz, who became the light heavyweight champion, got knocked out by Yuri Prochaska, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7729.0s)]
*  and then just got lit up by Ryan Spann. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7737.0s)]
*  Ryan Spann is this guy who's always been ultra, ultra talented, but just was always afraid of running out of gas, didn't train, didn't really put in camps. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7739.0s)]
*  Just had a lot of ability and a lot of technique. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7750.0s)]
*  In his last fight, he fought Dominic Reyes, and he put in a full training camp for the first time ever and just fucked Dominic Reyes up. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7752.0s)]
*  Just lit him up like a Christmas tree in the first round and put him away. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7761.0s)]
*  So you're talking about a guy who beat, in many people's eyes, should have won the decision against John Jones. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7764.0s)]
*  Then Ryan Spann just takes him out in the first round, easy, quick, because he finally worked hard. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7770.0s)]
*  There's something about that full training camp, man. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7777.0s)]
*  There's something about going out, no phone, up in the fucking mountains, away from civilization, away from the bacon and eggs, the silk sheets, [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7779.0s)]
*  the fucking five-star resorts, everybody knowing you, signing autographs and shit. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7789.0s)]
*  Dark matter. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7794.0s)]
*  Dude, dark matter like a motherfucker. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7795.0s)]
*  The further you fucking drive out your house and start going up in that fucking mountain, man, you start to... [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7797.0s)]
*  That fucking mine starts to click over, man. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7805.0s)]
*  You get a full camp up in some fucking dark matter place. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7806.0s)]
*  It's fucking over, bro. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7809.0s)]
*  There's a reason why so many guys would go up to Big Bear. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7810.0s)]
*  That's where Gennady Golovkin used to go up there. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7813.0s)]
*  Can't breathe in that motherfucker. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7816.0s)]
*  Muhammad Ali used to go to the Poconos. Tyson, rather, would go to the Catskills. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7817.0s)]
*  A lot of guys would do that. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7822.0s)]
*  A lot of evil up in them fucking mountains, boring Catskills. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7824.0s)]
*  It's also this nature. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7826.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7828.0s)]
*  Because nature doesn't give a fuck about you. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7829.0s)]
*  There's something you realize when you're running a mountain and you see eagles flying. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7830.0s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck about you. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7835.0s)]
*  No one. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7836.0s)]
*  There's no press. No one's watching. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7837.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing, man. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7838.0s)]
*  That's when you really know who you are. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7839.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7841.0s)]
*  When you get up there, there's no... [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7842.0s)]
*  Like the coach is probably back a little bit. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7843.0s)]
*  You got your little run by yourself and shit. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7845.0s)]
*  You figure out a lot. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7847.0s)]
*  You figure out a lot, man. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7849.0s)]
*  You start to figure out a lot of fucking problems up there by yourself. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7850.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7853.0s)]
*  So this is... [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7854.0s)]
*  To answer your question, I don't think there is a greatest ever [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7855.0s)]
*  because there's different weight classes. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7859.0s)]
*  You're right. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7860.0s)]
*  Khabib definitely is in the conversation. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7861.0s)]
*  He's the only really elite guy to retire undefeated. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7864.0s)]
*  That's a nasty motherfucker. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7867.0s)]
*  Oh, he was so good, dude. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7868.0s)]
*  There's something about looking at that motherfucker. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7870.0s)]
*  I love these guys who you can look in their eyes. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7872.0s)]
*  You can tell something ain't right. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7875.0s)]
*  Hard as nails. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7877.0s)]
*  You can tell something's fucking right. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7878.0s)]
*  Something ain't right. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7879.0s)]
*  That's in a good way. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7880.0s)]
*  Something ain't right. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7881.0s)]
*  When he fought Conor McGregor and they were booing him at the weigh-ins, [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7882.0s)]
*  and he goes, I'm gonna smash your boy. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7886.0s)]
*  He should play that interview. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7890.0s)]
*  Play that interview because when I'm talking to him [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7892.0s)]
*  and they're all booing and shit, it's like they're all Conor McGregor fans. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7895.0s)]
*  They flew in from Ireland. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7899.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a big fight. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7900.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7901.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm gonna smash your boy. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7902.0s)]
*  Alhamdulillah, I'm gonna smash your boy. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7904.0s)]
*  Play this. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7907.0s)]
*  Look at them booing him. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7910.0s)]
*  Khabib, what does this fight mean to you to defend your title tomorrow night against Conor McGregor? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7912.0s)]
*  It's so loud there. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7917.0s)]
*  That's why I'm screaming. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7918.0s)]
*  It's so loud. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7919.0s)]
*  First of all, I want to say, Alhamdulillah, God gave me everything. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7920.0s)]
*  Alhamdulillah, I know you got this. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7923.0s)]
*  You don't like this. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7926.0s)]
*  Alhamdulillah, tomorrow night, I'm gonna smash your boy, guys. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7927.0s)]
*  I'm gonna smash your boy. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7932.0s)]
*  And I want to say thank you all Irish fans, you know, all fans around the world. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7934.0s)]
*  Because of you guys, this fight has happened. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7941.0s)]
*  Thank you guys, and tomorrow night, inshallah, end still. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7945.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7949.0s)]
*  Good luck to you. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7950.0s)]
*  The champion, ladies and gentlemen. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7951.0s)]
*  Thank you all. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7953.0s)]
*  I'm gonna smash your boy. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7954.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7958.0s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7959.0s)]
*  He was on top of him, pounding him, going, let's talk now. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7960.0s)]
*  Because Conor talks. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7963.0s)]
*  He was saying it during the fight? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7964.0s)]
*  Play that, play that. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7965.0s)]
*  He's on top of him, punched him in the face, goes, let's talk, let's talk now. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7967.0s)]
*  Beating the fuck out of him. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7972.0s)]
*  That's the next level fucking shit, man. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7973.0s)]
*  Let's talk now. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7975.0s)]
*  Let's talk now. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7976.0s)]
*  And Conor was like, look at this. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7977.0s)]
*  Let's talk now. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7985.0s)]
*  Let's talk now. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7986.0s)]
*  Let's talk. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7987.0s)]
*  Let's talk now. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7993.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7995.0s)]
*  Stop. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=7998.0s)]
*  Conor's saying it's only business. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8000.0s)]
*  And Khabib says, you tired? [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8004.0s)]
*  Let's talk. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8006.0s)]
*  Jesus, dude. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8008.0s)]
*  He brought that shit to another level, man. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8009.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, he used that as fuel. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8011.0s)]
*  He took no fucking mental aid stations in that training camp. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8013.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8016.0s)]
*  He was a bad motherfucker. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8017.0s)]
*  And then when his father died, he told his mother he was going to fight one more time, and that's it. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8018.0s)]
*  And so he's in his prime still. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8023.0s)]
*  Right now, he's in his physical prime. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8025.0s)]
*  And he's like, told his mom, he's done. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8027.0s)]
*  He's not coming back, you don't think? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8030.0s)]
*  Well, his protege is Islam Mikhailovich, who is now the new UFC lightweight champion. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8032.0s)]
*  And Islam is as good as him in that same realm. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8038.0s)]
*  I mean, it remains to be seen whether or not Islam can have a reign the way he did, but he just beat Charles Olivera as one of the best ever. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8042.0s)]
*  And he just ran through him to win the title. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8049.0s)]
*  That's a bad dude, too, man. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8051.0s)]
*  Olivera's a bad motherfucker. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8053.0s)]
*  And Olivera's an interesting case, too, because Olivera used to be kind of a quitter. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8054.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8059.0s)]
*  He kind of fell apart in many fights early in his career, and then he had the birth of his daughter and then changed his fucking entire life. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8060.0s)]
*  He changed the way he fought, changed his mentality, changed his discipline and his focus, and then became this motherfucker who just dominated everybody. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8068.0s)]
*  How old is he? [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8078.0s)]
*  Olivera, I believe he's 33. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8079.0s)]
*  See, find out if that's accurate. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8081.0s)]
*  So there's some old fighters right now who are still kicking ass? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8083.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8087.0s)]
*  Jan Blachowicz, Glover Teshara just lost the light heavyweight title at 42. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8088.0s)]
*  He wanted it at 42 and then lost it to Yuri Prohovska in a very, very close fight. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8094.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's 33. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8098.0s)]
*  Olivera's 33. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8099.0s)]
*  You know what's funny about that, man, about us, these older guys who are still fucking grinding hard? [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8100.0s)]
*  People ask about Father Time. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8105.0s)]
*  Father Time doesn't get you, man. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8107.0s)]
*  It's Father Fatigue. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8109.0s)]
*  It's Father Fatigue, man. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8111.0s)]
*  Like, I see these guys who have been in sports for a long time fighting, basketball, football, whatever it is. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8113.0s)]
*  And it's that grind. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8118.0s)]
*  It's that everyday waking up grind. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8122.0s)]
*  It's not Father Time, man. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8124.0s)]
*  It's the fact that you know I got to go do it again. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8126.0s)]
*  I got to do it again. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8128.0s)]
*  So a lot of these guys are fighting Father Fatigue and they're doing a good job of doing it. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8130.0s)]
*  I think there's many factors. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8133.0s)]
*  There's Father Fatigue. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8135.0s)]
*  There's Father Enthusiasm. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8136.0s)]
*  That's right. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8137.0s)]
*  But then there's also injuries. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8138.0s)]
*  So many of these guys are fighting with fucked up backs and fucked up knees and fucked up elbows and fucked up hands. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8140.0s)]
*  And you don't know that when you see them because they look jacked and they look ripped. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8147.0s)]
*  In their head, they know I got to be careful if I move to the side on my right side because my knee's fucked. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8150.0s)]
*  I know all about that. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8157.0s)]
*  I got to be careful if I get kicked in the legs because this is fucked. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8158.0s)]
*  That's real shit. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8161.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8162.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of guys that also have been taking too many shots and they can't take a punch anymore. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8163.0s)]
*  That happens to guys. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8167.0s)]
*  And then you see they get dinged once and they get wobbly where... [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8169.0s)]
*  So what the fuck happens with that, man? [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8173.0s)]
*  I started seeing guys who have been getting hit a lot. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8175.0s)]
*  They can't take a hit anymore, man. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8177.0s)]
*  They'll fucking go out quick. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8179.0s)]
*  There's a lot of speculation. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8180.0s)]
*  And one of the things they say is that they believe that at a certain point in time, your brain tries to protect you from the punishment and just shut off. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8182.0s)]
*  Like that your body realizes like this dude is too strong mentally. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8191.0s)]
*  He's too tough and he'll just absorb shots and is just ruining our brain. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8196.0s)]
*  So when you get hit, your brain is like, check please. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8202.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8205.0s)]
*  And your brain will shut off. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8206.0s)]
*  And then the other...that's an optimistic perspective. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8207.0s)]
*  Got it. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8210.0s)]
*  The other less optimistic perspective is that you're destroying your mind and that your mind is simply not resilient anymore and you can't take a shot anymore because you've damaged all the connective tissue that's holding the fucking brain in place. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8211.0s)]
*  And you've also created so much CTE and so much swelling and so that one shot can take you out. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8224.0s)]
*  There's also on top of that, one of the big problems with MMA is the weight cutting. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8231.0s)]
*  So the weight cutting is what everybody does. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8235.0s)]
*  They drain themselves 24 hours before the fight, weigh in, say, oh, he weighs 170 pounds. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8238.0s)]
*  Guys like Kamaru Usman who's giant for 170. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8243.0s)]
*  He's 170 for like 20 minutes. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8247.0s)]
*  How much does he weigh? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8249.0s)]
*  Like walking around the street? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8250.0s)]
*  Kamaru, 200 pounds. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8251.0s)]
*  200 pounds. Easy. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8252.0s)]
*  So does he come back in the ring about 190, 200? [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8253.0s)]
*  He's in the 190s for sure. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8256.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8258.0s)]
*  Lean as fuck, shredded. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8259.0s)]
*  Lean as a motherfucker. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8260.0s)]
*  But dehydrated like hell to make 170. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8261.0s)]
*  He's not ever really 170. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8264.0s)]
*  He's 170, but like totally sucked up. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8267.0s)]
*  I mean, also cramping, you know, it's terrible to do that 24 hours before you have a cage fight is so crazy. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8272.0s)]
*  So those take a toll. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8279.0s)]
*  So if you're 35, 37, 39, all these guys that have been doing that their whole life, every time you cut that weight, it takes a little chip off the old block. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8283.0s)]
*  Every time, every time it takes it's another chop into the tree trunk. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8295.0s)]
*  It just weakens your foundation. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8300.0s)]
*  And it's just little minor things. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8302.0s)]
*  Every training camp you go through, you know, can you do another one? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8304.0s)]
*  You know, your back is fucked up. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8308.0s)]
*  You know, you get out of bed like this, like, ah, it's like little micro injuries that are constantly piling up. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8310.0s)]
*  You know, we were talking about Hicks and Gracie earlier. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8317.0s)]
*  Hicks can't really even roll hard anymore. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8319.0s)]
*  He's in the 60s and he's got these injuries all over his back. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8322.0s)]
*  It's all fucked up. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8326.0s)]
*  It's like all those years of jujitsu. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8327.0s)]
*  That Gracie shit's no joke though. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8329.0s)]
*  That motherfucker, that family. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8331.0s)]
*  They changed the world. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8333.0s)]
*  The world. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8334.0s)]
*  This little 160 pound motherfucker, man. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8335.0s)]
*  This little motherfucker, you can't even see him under some of these fat motherfuckers. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8338.0s)]
*  This fucking finger fucking locking you out, man. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8341.0s)]
*  Motherfucker gets you in a pinky lock, bro. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8345.0s)]
*  It's like, where is he tapping from? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8347.0s)]
*  Why is he tapping? I can't even see. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8349.0s)]
*  You know, Gracie. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8350.0s)]
*  Got a motherfucker in a pinky lock. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8351.0s)]
*  This shit was nasty, dude. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8355.0s)]
*  They taught the world jujitsu. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8356.0s)]
*  The world didn't know. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8358.0s)]
*  Jujitsu is the only martial art that people have ever experienced that did what was advertised. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8359.0s)]
*  What was advertised was that a small, skillful person could beat a larger, stronger opponent who didn't know the techniques. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8366.0s)]
*  He proved it. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8373.0s)]
*  He proved it. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8374.0s)]
*  Voice Gracie proved it in the UFC. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8375.0s)]
*  And he changed martial arts forever. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8377.0s)]
*  And that family's probably the most consequential, the most important, significant family in the history of martial arts. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8379.0s)]
*  The Gracie family changed martial arts worldwide. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8386.0s)]
*  It's funny, man. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8390.0s)]
*  There's so many people out here who are very successful. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8391.0s)]
*  And they talk about, I mean, super money, great family, they talk about that they're missing something. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8394.0s)]
*  That there's something in their life that they're missing. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8400.0s)]
*  And they talk to me about that shit. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8402.0s)]
*  And I mentioned the Gracie's. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8406.0s)]
*  It seemed like they had this, it wasn't about money. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8407.0s)]
*  It wasn't about nothing, man. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8412.0s)]
*  They're like grassroots motherfuckers. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8414.0s)]
*  And that's what I always tell people that they're missing. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8416.0s)]
*  That they're missing that desire. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8419.0s)]
*  Like those guys had a passion and a fucking just obsession. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8421.0s)]
*  That's the word. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8424.0s)]
*  Obsession. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8425.0s)]
*  Obsession. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8426.0s)]
*  And I guarantee you, man, those motherfuckers don't have those conversations. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8427.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm missing something. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8430.0s)]
*  They're not missing shit, dude. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8432.0s)]
*  No. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8434.0s)]
*  No, they got it figured out, man. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8435.0s)]
*  Well, Hickson in particular, because Hickson was Hoyce's older brother, who was, everybody says, is the greatest of all time. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8437.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8444.0s)]
*  From that era. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8445.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8446.0s)]
*  Because there has never been a time, other than today, there's a time right now with Gordon Ryan, which is very rare. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8447.0s)]
*  It's very rare where someone comes along and everybody says, this is the baddest motherfucker alive. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8453.0s)]
*  No if, ands, or questions about. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8459.0s)]
*  And back then when Hickson was in his prime, you ask any black belt anywhere in the world, they're like, Hickson's the man. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8461.0s)]
*  Hickson is the man. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8468.0s)]
*  He was a yogi. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8469.0s)]
*  He had all this crazy breath work that he would do. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8471.0s)]
*  He figured out the physical as well as the mental, far beyond where everybody else was willing to travel. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8474.0s)]
*  And there's a great documentary, people are interested in Hickson Gracie, called Choke. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8480.0s)]
*  Hickson's been on the podcast a couple of times. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8484.0s)]
*  There's a great documentary called Choke that followed him when he was in his prime in the 1990s competing in Japan. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8486.0s)]
*  And one of the things he does in that documentary, he gets in a frozen glacial river and he just sits down. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8493.0s)]
*  He's meditating in this river up to his neck of this fucking 30 degree water just washing over him. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8500.0s)]
*  Beyond talent, bro. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8505.0s)]
*  He's like, thank you, my lord. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8507.0s)]
*  Thank you, my lord. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8508.0s)]
*  And he's just like just taking it all in. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8509.0s)]
*  It's beyond talent. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8511.0s)]
*  That's badass. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8512.0s)]
*  There's so much involved. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8513.0s)]
*  There's talent, there's discipline, there's the mind, focus. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8515.0s)]
*  And there's also the brilliance of his ability to interpret and understand technique. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8519.0s)]
*  There's so many things. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8526.0s)]
*  That's badass. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8527.0s)]
*  And this is the case with Gordon Ryan today, who's arguably the greatest of all time. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8528.0s)]
*  And Gordon is a lot bigger than everybody. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8534.0s)]
*  Hickson was at his prime, he was about 200 pounds. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8536.0s)]
*  Gordon's like 240. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8540.0s)]
*  And Gordon is utilizing modern training methods and 365 days a year he trains. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8541.0s)]
*  Doesn't take any days off. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8548.0s)]
*  This is Hickson in the frozen glacial river. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8550.0s)]
*  That's his brother Hoyler, who's also one of the greats. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8554.0s)]
*  That's that Gracie family man. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8556.0s)]
*  Never been a family like that. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8558.0s)]
*  Never been a family like that in martial arts. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8560.0s)]
*  You just have like an army of killers. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8562.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8565.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8566.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8567.0s)]
*  See with the snorkel? [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8568.0s)]
*  That's what he likes to do, is to get under that water. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8569.0s)]
*  He does that with a cold plunge too. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8571.0s)]
*  It's crazy that so many people would never understand that kind of discipline or that kind of human being that wants to go to the stratosphere. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8573.0s)]
*  They'll always be misunderstood man. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8584.0s)]
*  Always. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8588.0s)]
*  That's why a lot of times when I talk to people, I can't have a conversation with a lot of people man. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8589.0s)]
*  Because you're going to walk away like... [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8594.0s)]
*  Why do you do it David? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8596.0s)]
*  Why don't you just take a break? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8598.0s)]
*  You deserve a break. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8600.0s)]
*  David take a nap. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8601.0s)]
*  Did you ever have a piece of pie? [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8603.0s)]
*  Why don't you put your feet up? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8605.0s)]
*  Why don't you rest a little? [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8609.0s)]
*  You think one day you'll get fat? [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8611.0s)]
*  You should let yourself get fat. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8613.0s)]
*  Dude, you're being funny as fuck. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8615.0s)]
*  It's the truest of all fucking statements. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8617.0s)]
*  Dude, I don't do new as much as you and I get it. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8619.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8622.0s)]
*  I'm like, you would never understand. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8623.0s)]
*  That's why we would never talk. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8626.0s)]
*  You would never get it. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8628.0s)]
*  That's why I don't have a conversation with people man. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8629.0s)]
*  Those are brutal conversations with people. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8631.0s)]
*  What? [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8633.0s)]
*  I don't understand what your motivation is. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8634.0s)]
*  What are you chasing? [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8636.0s)]
*  I haven't been on a podcast in four years. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8637.0s)]
*  Are you insecure? [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8639.0s)]
*  Where are you running from? [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8640.0s)]
*  Where are you running from David? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8641.0s)]
*  Where are you going? [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8642.0s)]
*  You know you get there faster in a car. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8644.0s)]
*  Oh, I get that a lot. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8646.0s)]
*  That's the one I get a lot. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8648.0s)]
*  I get that a lot. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8650.0s)]
*  And they're joking. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8651.0s)]
*  I'm like, and I don't find this shit funny. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8653.0s)]
*  I'm like, you motherfuckers man. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8655.0s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8656.0s)]
*  It's dumb as fuck man. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8657.0s)]
*  But whenever you're someone who's that wild and that far beyond where most people are willing to go, you're going to run into normies. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8658.0s)]
*  Well, it's like Motherfuckers going to the circuit breaker man, and they just go in there and start rewiring their brain. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8669.0s)]
*  They go in and say, like that motherfucker right there with the snorkel and shit. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8673.0s)]
*  Oh no man, I got to put this over here. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8677.0s)]
*  This circuit needs to be there. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8680.0s)]
*  That needs to be there. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8682.0s)]
*  You're totally rewiring how the whole brain works to not feel sorry for yourself, to ignore pain, to ignore discomfort, to push your mind in a place that people don't even fucking want to talk about. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8683.0s)]
*  They can't fathom. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8694.0s)]
*  And it's what you talk about with knowledge. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8695.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8697.0s)]
*  It's knowledge. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8698.0s)]
*  It's understanding of those feelings. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8699.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8701.0s)]
*  And the only way you understand that those feelings are rare. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8702.0s)]
*  They don't come up all the time, all day long. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8704.0s)]
*  You wouldn't be able to deal with them. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8706.0s)]
*  So most people don't know what to do with those feelings. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8708.0s)]
*  They're not around them enough, but you're around them constantly. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8711.0s)]
*  Hickson was around them constantly. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8714.0s)]
*  It's like get in those things and then you learn about them. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8716.0s)]
*  You get a map of the territory. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8719.0s)]
*  That's it. You get a blueprint. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8721.0s)]
*  And the second they surface when you're fucking getting choked out. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8722.0s)]
*  I've seen so many. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8725.0s)]
*  See, I love watching fights, man. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8726.0s)]
*  I see them and I start to say, okay, you're in a bad situation, man. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8729.0s)]
*  And I see a couple of guys getting ready to fucking tap. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8732.0s)]
*  And that one second decision, I call it. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8735.0s)]
*  They're thinking, man, I got to tap. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8738.0s)]
*  And you see the hand motion like I'm about to tap and it goes somewhere else. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8740.0s)]
*  Not today, motherfucker. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8745.0s)]
*  Because I've been here. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8746.0s)]
*  I've been here before. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8748.0s)]
*  I can last maybe just one more second. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8749.0s)]
*  And this one second may get me out of this shit. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8751.0s)]
*  And I see how the mind is evolving in that one moment, that one quick moment. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8754.0s)]
*  I see that a million thoughts went through their fucking mind and it didn't tap. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8760.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you an example of that. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8764.0s)]
*  Brian Ortega versus Alexander Volkanovsky. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8766.0s)]
*  Alexander Volkanovsky almost gets tapped out. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8769.0s)]
*  Volkanovsky is the next guy to fight Islam Makachev. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8772.0s)]
*  And Islam Makachev is Khabib's protege. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8776.0s)]
*  That's a bad boy. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8780.0s)]
*  Alexander Volkanovsky is the 145 pound champion. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8781.0s)]
*  He's going up to 155 to try to fight Makachev and win the title at that weight. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8785.0s)]
*  So he fights this guy, Brian Ortega, who is a student of Heron and Henner Gracie. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8790.0s)]
*  Got it. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8794.0s)]
*  So he's an elite black belt. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8795.0s)]
*  And he gets, Brian Ortega gets Volkanovsky in this guillotine choke, mounted guillotine choke, [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8797.0s)]
*  which is the nastiest shit ever. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8803.0s)]
*  And this guy is a fucking strangulation expert. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8806.0s)]
*  And Volkanovsky is stuck. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8809.0s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8812.0s)]
*  Give me some volume here. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8813.0s)]
*  There's his mind. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8817.0s)]
*  And he got out. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8819.0s)]
*  See? [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8820.0s)]
*  And he got out. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8821.0s)]
*  He was so close. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8822.0s)]
*  You hear Paul Felder saying he might go to sleep. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8823.0s)]
*  So he almost catches him here now in a darse. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8831.0s)]
*  And Volkanovsky winds up on top. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8836.0s)]
*  That's so badass. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8839.0s)]
*  And when he gets on top, he just starts hammering him. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8840.0s)]
*  I mean, this fight is one of the best examples. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8844.0s)]
*  You want to watch this fight. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8847.0s)]
*  You want to talk about will and warrior spirit. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8849.0s)]
*  This is one of the best fights ever for both guys. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8852.0s)]
*  Because Ortega, like going into the fourth round, you're like, how is this motherfucker surviving? [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8855.0s)]
*  And then he comes out in the fifth round guns blazing. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8860.0s)]
*  See? [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8863.0s)]
*  Both these guys just drained the fucking gas tank in this fight. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8864.0s)]
*  It was an amazing, amazing, amazing fight. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8867.0s)]
*  Now what he should have did after that, he should have gone home and wrote that shit out. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8869.0s)]
*  Because in that moment, if he could even think about it, the knowledge he gained in that moment, priceless. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8873.0s)]
*  What was happening when you almost tapped? [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8879.0s)]
*  And I'm not talking about the surface conversation. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8882.0s)]
*  That's beautiful to me. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8885.0s)]
*  I study that shit so much. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8886.0s)]
*  You were in a horrible situation. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8889.0s)]
*  I know you were like, I got to tap. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8891.0s)]
*  I got to tap. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8892.0s)]
*  But if you break that down, really break it down to the smallest molecule possible. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8893.0s)]
*  Your mind went through so many things that allowed you to not tap. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8898.0s)]
*  You got to study that, man. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8903.0s)]
*  That right there is so much. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8905.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8906.0s)]
*  That's beauty right there at work. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8907.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8910.0s)]
*  Because for that man, I mean, Volkanovsky, he walked out of there with his fucking belt, with the victory, the cheers, the roars, the crowd goes back home. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8911.0s)]
*  He fucking did it. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8920.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8921.0s)]
*  But he almost didn't. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8922.0s)]
*  See? [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8923.0s)]
*  He got to the door of death. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8924.0s)]
*  See? [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8925.0s)]
*  It's that one second decision. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8926.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8927.0s)]
*  That one second decision. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8928.0s)]
*  I talk about this motherfucker right here. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8929.0s)]
*  You get there, and you want to quit, and you don't. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8931.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8934.0s)]
*  And you end up fucking getting through it, man. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8935.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is like your book can give people, even if they don't get a map of the territory, they're getting directions. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8937.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8946.0s)]
*  You want to go to I-95. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8947.0s)]
*  That's right. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8948.0s)]
*  Go about 10 miles down. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8949.0s)]
*  That's right. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8950.0s)]
*  You know, Southern Hills Road, take a right. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8951.0s)]
*  You're giving them, you might not be giving them a map, because I think the map has to be acquired personally. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8953.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8958.0s)]
*  But you're giving them directions. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8959.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8961.0s)]
*  You're saying, this is how I got through. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8962.0s)]
*  This is how I developed my map. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8964.0s)]
*  People want to hand it to them. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8966.0s)]
*  I can't hand it to you. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8968.0s)]
*  You can't, but you can give them something. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8969.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8971.0s)]
*  When I texted you, I was in the middle of the book. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8972.0s)]
*  I was like, I can run through a fucking wall right now. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8974.0s)]
*  Because that's what it feels like. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8977.0s)]
*  I love that. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8978.0s)]
*  The first thing about the way you describe things and the way you're so honest and so personal about it, especially the audio version of it, and then when you do the podcast. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8979.0s)]
*  So the audio is a special treat, because it's the book. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8989.0s)]
*  And then with each individual chapter, you have a small podcast where you and your co-writer break down what it was like for you and what was happening and what you were feeling. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=8993.0s)]
*  And it allows you to do it in an unscripted way. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9007.0s)]
*  So you could really, and you're so honest about it. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9010.0s)]
*  It just gives you an understanding of that. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9013.0s)]
*  This discomfort is unavoidable. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9017.0s)]
*  And then trying to avoid discomfort just brings you more discomfort. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9020.0s)]
*  And you don't realize it. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9024.0s)]
*  It just brings you this long term, dull discomfort. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9025.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9028.0s)]
*  As opposed to the searing pain of like mid-struggle discomfort, which is what everybody's trying to avoid. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9029.0s)]
*  But you're still going to get discomfort. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9035.0s)]
*  You're just going to get this I could have, should have, would have been discomfort, which is maybe worse. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9038.0s)]
*  You're right. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9043.0s)]
*  It might be worse. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9044.0s)]
*  It just makes it a little easier. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9045.0s)]
*  That's all the repetitions do, man. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9047.0s)]
*  It doesn't take away the pain. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9049.0s)]
*  It doesn't take away the suffering. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9051.0s)]
*  No. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9053.0s)]
*  You just state it. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9054.0s)]
*  You know it. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9055.0s)]
*  You know how it feels. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9056.0s)]
*  You know when to breathe, when not to breathe. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9057.0s)]
*  You know all these different things. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9059.0s)]
*  You've been there. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9060.0s)]
*  You've visited it. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9061.0s)]
*  You've lived there for a long period of time. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9062.0s)]
*  And that's why I like this book so much is because Ken Hurtme was like a bachelor's degree. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9065.0s)]
*  It was like the surface level of David Goggins and some things that can help you out. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9071.0s)]
*  This to me is a master's degree. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9075.0s)]
*  This book right here takes you to another level of the mind and how you think. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9077.0s)]
*  And that's why I say this ain't no fucking self-help book. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9082.0s)]
*  This is a what the fuck are you doing with your life book? [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9085.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9088.0s)]
*  And that's why it's so important. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9089.0s)]
*  What do you do with your life, man? [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9090.0s)]
*  Why are you sitting around? [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9091.0s)]
*  Why are you waiting for shit to happen? [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9092.0s)]
*  It ain't gonna happen like that. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9094.0s)]
*  Why are you feeling sorry for yourself? [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9095.0s)]
*  Why are you waiting for that fucking apology that's never gonna fucking come? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9097.0s)]
*  People sit around waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and blaming and blaming [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9100.0s)]
*  and they're waiting with their hand out. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9105.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9106.0s)]
*  COVID happened and everybody's hands out now. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9107.0s)]
*  Hands out. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9109.0s)]
*  And you see how it changed sort of the tone of the country. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9110.0s)]
*  It did. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9113.0s)]
*  And it made people feel entitled like someone deserved, they deserve something. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9114.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9118.0s)]
*  That's right. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9119.0s)]
*  They deserve shit. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9120.0s)]
*  And that's the one thing that I knew and I found out. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9121.0s)]
*  And here's the worst part. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9123.0s)]
*  If they give you shit, you're gonna be even more miserable. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9125.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9128.0s)]
*  That's a true statement. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9129.0s)]
*  Isn't it a true statement? [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9130.0s)]
*  It's a true statement, man. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9131.0s)]
*  Everybody wants the government to come along and help them. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9132.0s)]
*  It's a true statement. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9134.0s)]
*  Someone to come along and give you things. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9135.0s)]
*  I should get things. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9137.0s)]
*  You should redistribute wealth. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9138.0s)]
*  You're not gonna be happy. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9139.0s)]
*  Nope. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9140.0s)]
*  You're not. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9141.0s)]
*  You gotta go get it. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9142.0s)]
*  No. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9143.0s)]
*  You're gonna always wonder, man, I have all this fucking money. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9144.0s)]
*  Why do I feel like I said? [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9146.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm missing something. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9148.0s)]
*  You're missing something. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9149.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9150.0s)]
*  Because you didn't go out and achieve it on your own. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9151.0s)]
*  It's like a man who inherited money. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9154.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9155.0s)]
*  They're always missing something. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9156.0s)]
*  Big time. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9157.0s)]
*  There's something wrong with them. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9158.0s)]
*  Someone gift wrapped you some shit. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9159.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9161.0s)]
*  And now you're just a bitch. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9162.0s)]
*  Now you're like a half a man. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9163.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9164.0s)]
*  You look like a man. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9165.0s)]
*  But you're like one of them Easter bunny candy things. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9166.0s)]
*  You know those chocolate Easter bunnies? [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9169.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9171.0s)]
*  You like, you try to bite into it. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9172.0s)]
*  I have to fuck them shits up. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9173.0s)]
*  This bitch is hollow. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9174.0s)]
*  I have to fuck them shits up now, 300. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9175.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9176.0s)]
*  Well, I loved them when they were solid. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9177.0s)]
*  When you got a solid one. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9178.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9179.0s)]
*  Ooh, look at this. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9180.0s)]
*  A lot more calories. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9181.0s)]
*  A lot more snacks than that bitch. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9182.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a solid Easter bunny. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9183.0s)]
*  But when you bite into one, it just destroys. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9186.0s)]
*  Oh, this is bullshit. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9188.0s)]
*  Fuck up your teeth. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9189.0s)]
*  This is a fucking hollow one. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9190.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9193.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people are hollow Easter bunnies. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9194.0s)]
*  A lot of people are hollow inside too. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9196.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9198.0s)]
*  But you don't have to be. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9199.0s)]
*  No. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9201.0s)]
*  This is the beautiful thing of your story is that you started out fucked up and you [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9202.0s)]
*  sucked up and sad and couldn't do anything and you transformed yourself. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9207.0s)]
*  So people don't think like this guy's just always been hard from the cradle to the grave. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9212.0s)]
*  Like you turned yourself into this, which is the real, that's the story that gives people [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9217.0s)]
*  hope. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9223.0s)]
*  You can truly develop other worldly discipline. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9224.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9227.0s)]
*  It's possible to develop other worldly mental strength. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9228.0s)]
*  Well, we change everything. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9230.0s)]
*  We change our car. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9232.0s)]
*  We change our house. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9233.0s)]
*  Sometimes we change our wife or husband. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9235.0s)]
*  We change the underwear. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9237.0s)]
*  We change everything in our lives. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9238.0s)]
*  Change our hair. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9239.0s)]
*  Change how we look. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9240.0s)]
*  Change everything. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9242.0s)]
*  But very few of us change how we think. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9243.0s)]
*  And that's the one problem with a lot of people. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9246.0s)]
*  They're not willing to change how they think. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9248.0s)]
*  You're not going to evolve if you continue thinking the same fucking way. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9250.0s)]
*  So a lot of people have a problem with that. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9255.0s)]
*  So I'm always trying to evolve in some way. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9257.0s)]
*  I'm never wearing the same underwear every day. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9259.0s)]
*  Always changing that bitch. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9262.0s)]
*  Never finished. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9264.0s)]
*  It's out right now, ladies and gentlemen. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9265.0s)]
*  I can't recommend it enough. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9267.0s)]
*  It's a fucking fantastic book. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9268.0s)]
*  As good, if not better, than Can't Hurt Me. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9270.0s)]
*  You're the man, brother. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9272.0s)]
*  Appreciate you very much. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9274.0s)]
*  Thank you, Joe. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9275.0s)]
*  All right. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9276.0s)]
*  Bye, everybody. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbDT2JTSnA8&t=9277.0s)]
