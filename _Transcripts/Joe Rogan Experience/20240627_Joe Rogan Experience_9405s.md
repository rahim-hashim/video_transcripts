# Joe Rogan Experience #1927 - Forrest Galante
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up, buddy? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=12.0s)]
*  Hey, bro. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=13.0s)]
*  You are still alive. This is a truthful title to this book. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=14.0s)]
*  That's true. It's ridiculous, but it's true. And it's catchy. That's the whole point. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=17.0s)]
*  Dude, I watched your show the other day, the television show. What is the television show? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=21.0s)]
*  Mysterious Creatures? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=26.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=27.0s)]
*  The new one? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=28.0s)]
*  The same wolf thing? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=29.0s)]
*  The Red Wolf. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=30.0s)]
*  Yes. But they didn't think it was a Red Wolf. They thought it was some mystical beast. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=31.0s)]
*  A howler. An Ozark howler. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=34.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=36.0s)]
*  Which, you know, wolves do howl. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=38.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, that was an interesting story. If you look at the timeline from when this cryptid, this howler, popped up, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=40.0s)]
*  it's right when the Red Wolf was starting to plummet in its numbers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=46.0s)]
*  And as soon as wolves plummet, they call to each other, right? They howl. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=51.0s)]
*  Ah, that makes sense. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=54.0s)]
*  So it's like, oh, we're hearing this thing and the spooky thing that we've seen running around the woods. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=56.0s)]
*  And it's like, well, yeah, it's wolves trying to find each other. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=60.0s)]
*  And it happened to also overlap with when moonshining was like a big deal. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=63.0s)]
*  So they perpetuated the rumor of the howler to keep people out of the woods. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=68.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=72.0s)]
*  So it like checked all these boxes to like make up this animal. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=73.0s)]
*  Is there any cryptid that you find compelling? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=76.0s)]
*  Just the, I think we talked about it before, the Megatherium, the giant ground sloth in Peru. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=80.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=84.0s)]
*  That's the only one. I mean, depends what you define as cryptid, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=85.0s)]
*  Like I'm not a Bigfoot guy or Loch Ness monster, but Thylacine could be considered a cryptid. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=89.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, because it was alive. We do have video footage of it and there's been a bunch of sightings. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=95.0s)]
*  Yes. But now you have all these Bigfoot-esque people, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=99.0s)]
*  All these sort of tinfoil hat guys who are like, it's here. I've seen it or whatever. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=103.0s)]
*  And so it's like started to fade into this cryptid realm. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=107.0s)]
*  And I still think that in Papua New Guinea, there could be an extant population. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=110.0s)]
*  Why in Papua New Guinea? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=114.0s)]
*  So they used to range, we got right into this. This is great by the way. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=116.0s)]
*  So they used to range from PNG from New Guinea all the way down to Tasmania. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=119.0s)]
*  And then as people came over, they brought dingoes with them. Right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=123.0s)]
*  And this is like 4,000 years ago. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=126.0s)]
*  And then the dingoes out competed the Thylacine in mainland Australia and in theory in Papua New Guinea. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=128.0s)]
*  But dingoes were never introduced into Tasmania, which is why they, Thylacine occurred for so much longer in Tasmania. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=134.0s)]
*  However, why in Papua New Guinea is because it's such a dramatic habitat. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=141.0s)]
*  There's so many like valleys and canyons and things that dingoes just probably couldn't traverse. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=146.0s)]
*  That would mean that there's isolated unexplored areas that the Thylacine, because it had evolved there, could still be thriving without the competition. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=152.0s)]
*  And for people who don't know what a Thylacine is, it's a Tasmanian tiger. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a marsupial wolf, crazy jaw, stripes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=165.0s)]
*  Crazy jaw. Really wild looking. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=169.0s)]
*  180 degrees. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah. Cool looking animal. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=173.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=175.0s)]
*  So when you talk about cryptids and blah blah blah, I still think that these animals could be out there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=176.0s)]
*  Didn't you go looking for one at one point in time? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=181.0s)]
*  Twice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=184.0s)]
*  Twice. And did you have any sightings or any at least, I mean, amongst the people that you were around, or any credible reports? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=185.0s)]
*  No. Well, reports, yes. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=192.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a guy named Nick Mooney who is like an incredible, that's Benjamin, the last living Thylacine in the zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=195.0s)]
*  A guy named Nick Mooney who's like a state biologist, like world, like renowned naturalist and biologist who has no reason to make this up or anything. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=203.0s)]
*  And he swears that he saw one in Tasmania about 25 years ago. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=214.0s)]
*  And he's like, I, you know, he's like, I know every animal in Tasmania. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=218.0s)]
*  I am a biologist. I work with Fish and Game or Fish, whatever their equivalent is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=222.0s)]
*  He's like, why would I make this up? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=226.0s)]
*  He's like, I didn't even tell anybody for a year or two because I didn't want to be called a kook. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=228.0s)]
*  And then he came out with it and sort of began this whole thing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=232.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, definitely some credible sightings. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=235.0s)]
*  How would one even do a survey of those areas? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=238.0s)]
*  If you're talking about like rainforests and tropical jungles and just dense wooded areas, how would one even find what's in there? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=242.0s)]
*  And for the most part unexplored too, especially when it comes to PNG and Western Papua. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=253.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. I think that's the barrier to entry, right? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=258.0s)]
*  Anybody can go to Tasmania, drive down a highway and be like, oh, I looked and I didn't find it, which is basically what I did. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=261.0s)]
*  But to get into those places that they could be extant requires helicopter support, refuels, tons of local ground support, you know, like local hunters and tribal people that know the land. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=267.0s)]
*  And so it's a big, expensive operation to try and get into these places. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=279.0s)]
*  And then that's just getting in. Then you'd pepper it with trail cameras, baited cameras. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=283.0s)]
*  You do some sent trailing, some sound calling, you know, all these. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=288.0s)]
*  I mean, you're a hunter, you know, these techniques. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=291.0s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because we know that mountain lions are real, but most people don't ever see a mountain lion. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=293.0s)]
*  Right. And a lot of people that live in these heavily wooded areas don't see mountain lions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=299.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like it's hard to find one and they're everywhere. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=305.0s)]
*  They live in our cities. Yeah. There's a shit ton of them. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=308.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you might get lucky and catch one. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=310.0s)]
*  But the populations are pretty great in terms of like, right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=313.0s)]
*  Like if you're in Colorado or if you're in Utah, I mean, they have a lot of mountain lions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=317.0s)]
*  And it's very rare that you see one. Exactly. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=322.0s)]
*  So imagine if there was a very small population of mountain lions or Tasmanian tigers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=324.0s)]
*  And, you know, you went looking in a much more wooded area, much more dense environment. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=329.0s)]
*  Much larger too. You know, huge swaths of unpopulated land. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=334.0s)]
*  And if they were intelligent and cryptic like a mountain lion, which they probably were because they were at the top of the food chain, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=338.0s)]
*  they know and they choose not to be seen. Like, yeah, like P-22, right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=345.0s)]
*  The mountain lion that lived in L.A. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=349.0s)]
*  We have a big photo of him out here. The one with the Hollywood sign. Yeah. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=351.0s)]
*  Yeah. Great picture. I love that photo. He just. He's dead now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But yeah. But did they kill him? Did they euthanize him? They euthanized him. Yeah. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=358.0s)]
*  Something's wrong with him, right? He was badly injured. He got hit by a car. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=362.0s)]
*  I think. Don't quote me on that. But yeah, some injury. I think it was a car strike and it was an old. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=367.0s)]
*  He was an old cat as well. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think of the Orang Pendek? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=372.0s)]
*  I think it's interesting. Have you ever seen that motorcycle video where the guy's on the motorcycle and he sees the little guy run across? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=377.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's supposed to be Orang Pendek, right? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=383.0s)]
*  Well, let's see if we can find that. Sure. That one is weird because. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=387.0s)]
*  Like, is that real? It's so. And is this a kid? You know, that one looks over embellished. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=393.0s)]
*  But if you watch the actual video. Yeah. So this is the video I've seen. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=401.0s)]
*  I think that we love humanoids like as a species. We love the idea. Just play the video. It's not. It doesn't play. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=407.0s)]
*  It's all still frames. All of it. It's all someone talking about this. It's not. Oh, well, that looks so fake. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does. That's a still frame of it. But that could just be a naked dude. Totally. That could be a crazy dude. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't even look that hairy. But I think look at the proportions looks like a person. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=427.0s)]
*  Did they have like something to judge it by? I've seen the actual video, though, Jamie. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=433.0s)]
*  See if we can find the actual video because that's not it. Yeah, this is the same one I've seen. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=438.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think in relation to like the motorcycle and the guy, even though there's some force perspective, it's tiny. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=443.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it looks like a dude, but that would be like a four foot tall guy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=452.0s)]
*  So here's these guys are on this motorcycle racing along. Is that the one? I felt like it ran across before. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=456.0s)]
*  That one looks fake. This one looks fake. I'm certain I saw a different one. That one looks like a full on setup. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=465.0s)]
*  The guys slow their bike down just in time. Yeah, this one's nonsense. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=470.0s)]
*  Why? Well, that was where it ran across the road. The one that I saw, though, I thought it was dark haired. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=476.0s)]
*  And it ran like this way across the road. And it was a very quick and brief video. Same. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=483.0s)]
*  That's the one that I'm thinking of as well. 17 million views. Well, maybe this is probably it then. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=488.0s)]
*  But I don't. It's hard to remember because I've seen so many stupid fucking videos. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=493.0s)]
*  But I seem to remember it looking almost like an ape person. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=499.0s)]
*  I think my opinion and I'm not really. You can find anything. OK. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=504.0s)]
*  I'm not really qualified to speak on like these humanoid cryptid things. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=509.0s)]
*  But like we have Khoisan in southern Africa, right? The small Bushmen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=512.0s)]
*  You know, in Borneo, Sumatra and places like this, there are still very isolated groups of tribal people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=516.0s)]
*  And sure, they're talking about proportions of small people and all of that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=524.0s)]
*  But what's stopping a teenager? Doesn't matter. I don't care what tribe you're from. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=529.0s)]
*  If you're a teenager, you're going out there and you're being rebellious, right? Right. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=533.0s)]
*  From going out with a spear to go on a hunt and deciding to continue going. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=536.0s)]
*  And then he crosses a road, you know, and now it's become a big foot or an appendect or whatever, because he gets startled. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=540.0s)]
*  Maybe he's doing something illegal or wrong or whatever and runs. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=546.0s)]
*  Somebody catches it on their helmet cam and now it's perpetuating into this big thing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=550.0s)]
*  Or they see it in low light. They see it at dawn. Right. Yeah. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=554.0s)]
*  If you think about that, that island of Flores, though, that's where things get interesting. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=558.0s)]
*  Like Mia Flores, right? Well, the homo floriensis. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=565.0s)]
*  How do you say it? I'm not sure. Flori. I think it's floriensis. Yeah, I'm not sure. Floriensis. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=570.0s)]
*  But that's the little hobbit person that they've confirmed lived alongside people as recently as I forget how long ago. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=577.0s)]
*  It's like 8,000 or 10,000 years ago or something like that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=585.0s)]
*  They think it was fairly recent. Yeah. Within, you know, after the Ice Age. Yeah. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=587.0s)]
*  Which is pretty crazy. Yeah. I mean, you know, and there are across the human species, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=593.0s)]
*  there are so many diverse looking cultures and tribes and peoples, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=599.0s)]
*  We're all humans, but, you know, Aboriginal people, African people, Indonesian people, Asian people, we all look different, you know, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=603.0s)]
*  and we all have these own distinct characteristics. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=610.0s)]
*  And so to think about, you know, imagine being a Westerner or whatever, being an Indonesian like in that video. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=613.0s)]
*  And then you see someone who looks so different than your own culture and you're not expectant of it. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=620.0s)]
*  It's very easy to let your imagination turn into this whole other species, this cryptic thing [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=626.0s)]
*  versus like maybe this is someone from a different tribe who's in a different area. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=631.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. I'm just saying it's it's. And then there's also they keep finding new extinct species of humans, right? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=636.0s)]
*  Like Denisovans and all. I think there was another one that they found recently that they're trying to figure out what it is. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=643.0s)]
*  But they're very human like in terms of Homo sapien like but a slightly different branch of the chain. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=650.0s)]
*  Yeah, with different like jaw morphologies or cranium shapes or whatever. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=656.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think we used to up until 15, 20 years ago only think that there was like two or three species of humanoid ever. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=660.0s)]
*  Right. Right. And now there's like I want to say eight. Yeah. Which is pretty crazy. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=668.0s)]
*  Well, that leads me to Bigfoot because I think that all these stories of Bigfoot, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=672.0s)]
*  I think like the Native Americans have a bunch of different names for some creature that lives in some large hairy creature. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=677.0s)]
*  And we know about Gigantopithecus. I think that's what that is. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=684.0s)]
*  I think people just have a distant memory of it like a remnant memory that's evolved over time. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=689.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Which is probably the same thing as dragons. And I know we talked about that. Yeah. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=694.0s)]
*  And also, by the way, it could be the same thing as phyllocene going back to that. Right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=699.0s)]
*  Like they could have been in PNG where these tribes are still talking about them 4000 years ago. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=703.0s)]
*  And this lore of the striped dog that sounds weird, that has this funny jaw has been passed down generation to generation to the point where somebody's out on a hunt or a walk and they see a flash and they go, oh, that was that stripe dog. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=709.0s)]
*  My grandfather told me about. Now it's real. I saw a squirrel once in Alberta. And for a full second, I thought it was a wolf. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=722.0s)]
*  Please tell me how that happened. I was looking for wolves. Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=733.0s)]
*  I was looking for it to be a wolf. I definitely saw a wolf once. Yeah. And it was pretty cool. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=737.0s)]
*  It was either a wolf or a large coyote, but I'm pretty sure it was a wolf in Alberta. Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=742.0s)]
*  Because it was at dusk and it ran across the road. And I was with Cam Haynes. We both noticed it. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=746.0s)]
*  It looked like a wolf. It's too big and stocky. And it was, you know, distant getting dark. Yeah. Hard to tell. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=753.0s)]
*  But they're up there. There's a shit ton of them. I mean, they have tons of trail cameras of them. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=760.0s)]
*  And they see them there all the time. But I saw this thing run across this this this like down tree. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=765.0s)]
*  And for it was the tail of the squirrel. And for the full like a full second. Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=773.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God, is that a wolf fur? That's a fucking squirrel. God, you're dumb. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=780.0s)]
*  That was like that was played out in my mind. But you had already made it to be a wolf. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=785.0s)]
*  And if you hadn't seen the rest of the squirrel, you had always seen a wolf. Wolf, bro. Yeah. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=791.0s)]
*  Yeah. Which is what I think people do with black bears that stand up on hind legs and they see Bigfoot. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=797.0s)]
*  Black Panthers. You see a house cat run across the road out in the woods. Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=803.0s)]
*  It's black and the perspective. You don't have any scale. I saw a black panther. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=807.0s)]
*  But I mean, the you know, the the wolf thing is interesting because it's like, you know, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=813.0s)]
*  you know, they're they're reintroducing wolves in different parts of America. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=818.0s)]
*  And now they're they're trying to do it to Colorado. And it's like, I hope you guys know what you're doing. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=822.0s)]
*  Because this idea that you're going to be able to control their populations once you reintroduce them, you're not gonna you're not even going to find them. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=828.0s)]
*  Correct. Yeah. And I mean, you know, like we've seen a wolf pack. I'm blanking on the name of it now. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=835.0s)]
*  But it's moved all the way down from Washington through Oregon. Now it's all the way to Central California. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=840.0s)]
*  Right. San Luis Obispo County, Central California. Really? I don't think they're resident, but they've dipped in because we have tracking collars on them. Right. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=845.0s)]
*  Wow. So they've come all the way from Washington all the way through Oregon. San Luis Obispo. Isn't that wild? Wow. Yeah. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=852.0s)]
*  They're amazing. Incredible. And they are helpful to the environment. You know, they do fill a role and they outcompete the coyotes and you know, their populations. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=860.0s)]
*  They'll also kill your kids. They'll also kill your kids. Yeah, they can. I mean, they are fucking predators. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=868.0s)]
*  And they don't have any rules. Like we are so goofy and naive when it comes to the idea of predators. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=873.0s)]
*  We think like, well, we have an agreement, a spoken agreement with the people of the forest. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=878.0s)]
*  Living beings of the forest. I am your friend. I used to live in Boulder, Colorado. And there's this lady I knew who's a yoga instructor. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=885.0s)]
*  That says a lot. I told her she's the best. I told her that I saw a mountain lion. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=893.0s)]
*  She goes, well, when I go into the woods, I literally say a prayer and I let the creatures of the woods know I know them and I offer no harm. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=899.0s)]
*  I am there only to just peacefully walk amongst them. I am not a threat. Well, you shut the fuck up. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=912.0s)]
*  Go for a walk through the African bush for one night and see how well that does. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=919.0s)]
*  What are you talking about, lady? You think when you could have zagged and you run into a bear and you're fucking dead. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=923.0s)]
*  100%. They eat yoga instructors too. This idea that you're going to like, I send out a message of peace. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=929.0s)]
*  We've become so jaded in the sense of like nature is in harmony and balance. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=936.0s)]
*  That's like this Western idea of like everything so harmonious in nature. It's terrifying. It's the opposite, you know. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=945.0s)]
*  It's such a dumb perspective. It's so misinformed. It's just based on idealistic perspectives. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=952.0s)]
*  It's based on this idea of a utopia that exists in the woods. It's just not. It's tooth, fang, and claw. It's fucking chaos. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=958.0s)]
*  It's also based on disconnect, in my opinion. If you've spent time in the wild, if you've spent time, I don't care if you're fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, whatever, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=966.0s)]
*  but like somewhere that is really raw, you're like, holy shit, no, that's not, it's not, you know, all Shangri-La out here. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=975.0s)]
*  Like it is eat or be eaten. Yeah. Yeah, not at all. No, no other video of the Oarang Pendek. Is that? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=982.0s)]
*  That seems to be it. I found a video that looks less fake, but it's the same video. So it just did a better job. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=989.0s)]
*  All right. Let's see what that one looks like. It looks less fake. Oh, actually, I just lost it. I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=994.0s)]
*  I have the one that we looked up. It's that video. It's the same one? It's all the stories, all the daily mail, everything goes back to that video. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1000.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. Must have been that. I think I might have seen just a clip of it. Probably. Not that longer. Yeah. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yeah, they probably didn't show the one when he's running on the road itself because it looks so fake. So it looks like shit. Yeah. Versus the one where he darts across. Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1011.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like a naked person. Yeah, it does. Like a person in a spandex costume. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1019.0s)]
*  Dude, I went to a wedding in downtown Los Angeles a couple years ago and there was a guy, probably had a mental illness, but he was like 6'5", walking down downtown LA butt naked with this massive shlong just bouncing between his knees. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1025.0s)]
*  It looked like a different species to me. I mean, this huge beard, like 6'5", massive dude just trotting down the street of LA. Right. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1039.0s)]
*  If you saw that in the woods, going in between the trees from a distance. 100%. You would say, oh my God, there's giants in the woods. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1046.0s)]
*  I'm a bigfoot believer like that. If I had seen that exact guy cruising through a park, cruising out in the woods, I'm a believer. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1053.0s)]
*  Especially if he's covered in dirt and it's dark out. Exactly. Well, mentally ill people do wind up moving to the woods. It's happened. Yeah, I mean, it happens all the time. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1060.0s)]
*  I remember there was this one guy who was famous in Maine. He was a legend that he would break into people's houses and steal their stuff. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1070.0s)]
*  And then they found out that he was a real person and he had dropped out of society in like the 1970s and just decided to completely live by himself. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1081.0s)]
*  Like he didn't talk to people for decades. Oh, wow. And he was by himself alone in a tent in the woods and he would just steal stuff from people's houses when they weren't around. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1094.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. And like live off of whatever he found or ate. And I don't know what his woods craft was like. Is this it? Stranger in the woods. Yeah, this sounds like it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1103.0s)]
*  For 27 years, Christopher Knight lived alone in a clandestine wooded camp in a tiny in tiny Rome. I don't know what that is. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1116.0s)]
*  Undiscovered and unaided, breaking into camps to steal what he needed to survive. When he finally captured and arrested in April 2013, the story of the North Pond Hermit made headlines worldwide. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1125.0s)]
*  But Knight spoke only to one journalist, Michael Finkel, an exclusive excerpt from his new book, Finkel Explains the Origins of the Whispered Myth that Haunted Central Maine for Decades, the Legend of the Stranger in the Woods. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1137.0s)]
*  It's pretty cool. It is kind of cool. It's cool. He like did his own. Yeah. Look, I mean, I'm sure he had all kinds of probably issues, right? Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1151.0s)]
*  But he lived his own like he made his own path. He lived off of stuff. It reminds me. Have you ever heard of the Japanese survivor in Guam? Have you heard about that? Yes, I did. Yeah. Tell that story. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1159.0s)]
*  So from my understanding, during World War Two, there was a crash in Guam and from a dogfight and this Japanese pilot or guy who was in the plane went and hid in a cave up on a mountain in Guam. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1169.0s)]
*  And he spent until like 2002 living in this cave, thinking that World War Two was continuing and he thought he had a better life living in a cave and living off of the jungle because Guam is like a hub for, I think, United or Delta, one of the major airlines. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1182.0s)]
*  So all these planes are coming in and out every day and he thinks it's World War Two continuing. Wow. Yeah. And there's military bases and everything else in Guam. Was it really 2002? Jamie would have to look, but it was very recent. God, I thought it was like the 80s or something. I didn't know it was like that's he must have been old as fuck. Yeah. He was like in his 70s or so. I don't know. I'm probably getting the date wrong. We'll find it. But still. That's so crazy. But can you imagine? How would you know? How would you know? And what if you fucked up and went into the cave? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1197.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1227.0s)]
*  cave. I'm going to go to the cave. I'm going to go to the cave. You just get it, 158 that's where he see him, like with the [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1257.0s)]
*  40 years found and 74, that's, uh, that's what we're talking about there with 45. So I stayed on in 72. I just all story this morning, which Syd's not knew, it apparently was in urine 13. There is a man. Korean took his two sons after Vietnam came But, um, came and they were hid in the woods for 40 years. Wow. Force to live off rats and make loincloth at a tree bark Man who spent 41 years . living in the jungle after fleeing Vietnam war. makes emotional return to developing. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1282.52s)]
*  41 years [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1284.76s)]
*  Picture of him social skills obviously and he didn't know what a woman was they said he's really his father didn't tell him [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1287.24s)]
*  What a woman was they saw five people their whole life and hid from him in the woods and I saw him [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1292.64s)]
*  Do you think oh my god like would you if you're put into his position is it worth living like 85 [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1300.0s)]

*  Why is his haircut so good? That's a good question [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1319.64s)]
*  Bullshit, I think this is after they found him and they took him back to take pictures and [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1322.72s)]
*  Doin they redressed him. This is horseshell. Look great. Yeah, they redressed him after they redressed him in rags [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1327.2s)]
*  Yeah, for the photo. That's what he was a little better. Yeah, that looks like a guy living in the woods [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1332.5600000000002s)]
*  Wow [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1338.28s)]
*  Rat head [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1339.88s)]
*  He's eating rat heads. What does it say his son was killed? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1340.8400000000001s)]
*  What does this one day his wife and two son two of his sons were killed by a mine explosion [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1343.92s)]
*  Putting him in a state of shock took his two-year-old son and fled into the jungle thereafter [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1349.0800000000002s)]
*  Never having any contact with anyone else the pair survived by foraging fruit and cassava from the forest and planting corn [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1354.1200000000001s)]
*  They wore loincloths made a tree bark and lived in a timber hut raised five meters above the ground [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1362.72s)]
*  Cassava is not the stuff that you need to boil and filter and strain. No, no, what am I thinking of? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1370.44s)]
*  Tarot tarot root. Is that what it is? Yeah cassava is like a potato. Right? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1377.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, right. What is the one that like actually a strychnine in it? They it's very common in the jungle of [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1382.16s)]
*  Central America and South America [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1390.08s)]
*  I think taro is what you're referring to because it's very starchy and basically inedible until you boil it down [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1391.6399999999999s)]
*  Is that what it is? I think so [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1397.6s)]
*  Mmm, that doesn't sound familiar. It doesn't sound right. Hmm taro. I know what taro is but taro like they make taro chips [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like you could eat taro chips. This stuff they boil down. They turn it into like a [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1407.9199999999998s)]
*  Like a meal, I'm not sure smash it and do all kinds I thought it was cassava [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1415.4s)]
*  Everything like when I when we've worked down in the Amazon and stuff in the remote areas of the Amazon everything boiled [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1421.96s)]
*  That's just how everything's like day one. You're like, oh man, this fresh boiled piranhas so good day 13 [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1427.64s)]
*  You're like, please God no boiled piranha for breakfast [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, isn't it interesting? We've gotten to this point as a society where we eat what we enjoy [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1437.44s)]
*  Right, it's not what's what just keeps you alive, right? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1443.76s)]
*  I was with Steve Rinella once and he caught a beaver and we cooked the beaver and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1447.24s)]
*  One of the things that he cooked was the beaver tail and he said that it was a staple amongst [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1453.56s)]
*  Trappers, okay [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1460.96s)]
*  They really like beaver tail because it was a good concentration of fat was a great source. I imagine it's just a big fatty tissue [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1462.0s)]
*  Disgusting yeah that but when you're dying of fat like you need fat right you're starving [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1468.8s)]
*  Right, like fat is literally what you crave then it becomes delicious. Sure, then it's not a matter of you know [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1474.52s)]
*  Oh, I prefer fried chicken. Well, I'm a pizza guy myself [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1480.56s)]
*  You know, it's not we eat based on our flavor preferences. It is interesting because taste is so [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1483.76s)]
*  Elemental to what we decide to do every single day. Oh, I like this. I like that [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1492.32s)]
*  But that's not the point of food right the point of food is nourishment, right? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1496.52s)]
*  It's to keep your body strong and you continue to have energy and yet we just like we've completely abandoned that notion [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1501.72s)]
*  In fact so much so that we have the opposite problem where we're over nourishing, you know [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1508.1200000000001s)]
*  At least with fats and oils and things like that constantly. Yeah. Yeah, it's I [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1512.24s)]
*  Mean if people could come from the past back from those pioneer days and see people today they'd be like, oh my god [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  This is wild. They probably everyone's great fat [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1524.88s)]
*  They probably cuz that was like a sign of being healthy back then and yeah and wealthy right? Yeah, I could afford to be fat [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1527.5200000000002s)]
*  They'd be like, wow, this is great [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1532.7600000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't know about healthy but it was definitely a sign of wealth and the fact that you didn't have to work [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1534.0800000000002s)]
*  And so like when you look at those paintings from the Renaissance, yeah, those Ruben esque women [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1538.64s)]
*  Yeah, like that was attractive like we were psyched if you found a big fat lady. Yeah big old gal [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1544.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that girl's he's eating good. That's what I like. That's what I need. I like some skinny farmer lady [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1549.2s)]
*  Like some royal lady who gets to just have fruit given to her while she's right down [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1555.1200000000001s)]
*  Last time I we hung out you were doing pure carnivore. Yeah, how was that now you're doing it now? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1560.44s)]
*  Yeah, because it's January January's world carnivore month. I don't know [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1565.44s)]
*  Yeah, why not? I I mixed in a little fruit [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1570.44s)]
*  I eat fruit because I find when I don't do that [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1573.8000000000002s)]
*  I did straight carnivore for the first few days like I think like the first eight or nine days [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1576.42s)]
*  But it was it's hard I was slogging through workouts just no energy [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1582.16s)]
*  Yeah, like like just a and they say there's an adjustment period just like keto, you know [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1587.52s)]
*  They call it like the if you've ever done [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1593.74s)]
*  Have you ever done a keto diet? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1595.58s)]
*  Not for more than like a week at a time [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1596.92s)]
*  It takes a while to really get your body to turn ketogenic and to start burning fat instead of carbohydrates [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1598.96s)]
*  And it's there's a thing they call the keto flu where it feels like almost like you got the flu [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1605.54s)]
*  Not really like the flu. It's a bad way of describing it. It's more like you're not well rested. Gotcha. Gotcha [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1611.92s)]
*  So like when I would work out I would like have to really push through these workouts [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1618.48s)]
*  Mm-hmm, like you feel like you're missing a gear. Sure. It feels just none of that extra ATP to like burn [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can't get into fourth gear. It's it's weird. It's like it doesn't feel good [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1628.8s)]
*  I'm sure oh, sorry. Go ahead. I'm saying it's the same but when I added fruit that goes away [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1634.04s)]
*  That's what's gonna ask yeah after we hung out and you were doing that I read Paul Saladino's book the carnivore code [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1638.04s)]
*  I think it's called a carnivore diet the one where he eats meat fruit and honey [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1643.8s)]
*  Yeah, and bases it because like he's been on your show before right? Yeah, so I read his book and I thought it was really interesting [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1646.72s)]
*  You know the whole idea of like those are the most sought-after foods in the world [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1652.32s)]
*  And they are for most cultures, but definitely not all cultures, right? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1656.92s)]
*  Which I think is it all depends on what the resources are, right? Of course [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1661.18s)]
*  If you're dealing with a culture that has access to an enormous amount of rice an enormous amount of or cassava or whatever [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1665.28s)]
*  Those things are you know, there's there's different things that people eat where they you know, they just eat it because of convenience [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1672.12s)]
*  That's availability. Yeah and cost is an effort, right? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1678.12s)]
*  But if you have access to all the food and you really wanted to live an optimal lifestyle [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1681.52s)]
*  I do think that organs are [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1686.76s)]
*  Primary it's like eating liver and eating heart. Yep, very very good for you and then eating red meat [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1689.56s)]
*  Yeah, especially like lean red meat. Nah, it's for you. Mm-hmm. It's all about it's all about lucky charms [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1696.46s)]
*  That was why isn't that nuts that that's a real like NIH funded food chart that places lucky charms above eggs [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1704.84s)]
*  There were so many things to not just the lucky [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1712.52s)]
*  Preposterous but there were so many things that I like covered almonds right that's healthier than that's candy [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1715.68s)]
*  That's literally chocolate. Yeah, there's almonds, but it's fucking chocolate, which is sugar and some cacao [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1721.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was wild straight horse shit. Yeah, these people are criminals. Yeah, they're all being paid off [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1728.48s)]
*  They've all been paid off by these big food corporations by the big food. Yeah [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1734.68s)]
*  Well, it's been proven that like there's been a bunch of these people that are like fat doctors that are trying to tell you that [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1740.16s)]
*  There are no junk foods and it's really [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  Shaming people. Yeah big fat ladies that are saying this, you know [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1750.12s)]
*  The same kind of ones don't want you using term fat sure, but they're [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1754.28s)]
*  They're being paid off by like these companies that make like fucking ho ho's or eos and blah blah shit [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that kind of food not maybe maybe not those in specific but right those kinds of foods where they're readily available [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1765.84s)]
*  supermarkets [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1773.44s)]
*  Jenner in general other than rice and [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1774.32s)]
*  Some beans and some other stuff that you get in the center of the grocery store [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1777.6s)]
*  All the shit around the edges is what you want. You want the stuff that's interesting [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1780.96s)]
*  You want this stuff like the vegetables like they have to like they've replaced them all the time [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1784.8s)]
*  Yeah, that shit in the boxes in the middle most of stuff's not good for you [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1789.48s)]
*  Of course unless it's canned or bottled. Yeah, I mean there's tomato sauces and stuff that sure center [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1793.68s)]
*  That's that's fine for you still packed with sugar though, right some of them. Yeah, there's organic ones [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1799.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but the outside that's what you want. Yeah, you want where the milk is. Where's the cheese? Where's the eggs? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1803.2s)]
*  Sure on the outside it's refrigerated. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a reason you have to eat it fresh [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1808.4s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta eat it quick, right? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1812.72s)]
*  And it's really like a lot of the stuff like especially pasteurized and homogenized milk [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1814.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a real good argument that's not even good because your body's like what is this weird liquid protein stuff? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1819.4s)]
*  This is not like where's the enzymes that are supposed to be available in raw milk? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1825.16s)]
*  So what what's your feeling on like a protein shake like you're doing this carnivore thing? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1829.68s)]
*  You're obviously getting tons of protein. You're not doing a protein shake as well. No, it's not necessary [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1833.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if you're eating meat most most of what I'm eating is meat and eggs. Sure [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1838.2s)]
*  That's what mostly what I mean. That's a dream diet really but the thing is I feel great. Yeah my I'm very [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1842.6s)]
*  Clear-headed and I have a lot of energy. It's like every time I do it every January [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1848.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm like God, why don't you eat this way all the time? The problem is I'm a glutton [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1853.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I really love pasta cheeseburgers and I really love pizza. I fucking love pizza man [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1857.72s)]
*  Yeah, whoa, I love bread. Yeah, it's great [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  But it's it's definitely not my thing in terms of like what my body responds to the best [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1867.5800000000002s)]
*  My body responds the best to fruit and meat and eggs and and you know organ meats and that's really and fish [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1873.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, my body responds the best when I eat that stuff and when I eat that stuff my body's like, yeah great [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1881.4399999999998s)]
*  This is awesome. Like I can eat a steak and they go right on stage [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1886.56s)]
*  Yeah, and you feel fine feel good. But if I eat a bowl of spaghetti go on stage. I'm fucking your drip [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1889.32s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. You know whole pizza and go on stage [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1894.9199999999998s)]
*  I'm so dumb. It's like it takes away like 30% of my [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1898.6s)]
*  Clarity. Yeah, so let me ask you this and if you've covered this kind of stuff before by all means we can skip over it [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1904.04s)]
*  Do you get more aggressive when you're on the carnivore diet? I [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1909.4799999999998s)]
*  Think you do. Yeah. Yeah, why well you think about carnivores worldwide, right? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1913.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, taking humans out of the equation just pure carnivores lions wolves so on and so forth [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1919.28s)]
*  There's definitely a correlation between the need to eat meat and the drive for eating meat, right and that drive comes from aggression, right? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1923.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's why they're fighting. That's why they're in competition. That's why they're at the top of the food chain, right? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1931.72s)]
*  So this is a personal theory that's grounded in nothing [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1936.52s)]
*  But I would think when you're eating nothing but meat which is going to spike your testosterone [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1939.78s)]
*  It's going to make you feel and act more like a carnivore and less like an omnivore, right and be more aggressive [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1944.32s)]
*  You know more dominant. I don't know and again you've had people on the show far more qualified [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1951.2s)]
*  But it's just thinking as a biologist who know who's studied carnivores you see [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1955.6200000000001s)]
*  That aggression comes from a place of it's it's cyclical. Yeah food makes them aggressive the the aggression makes them require acquire food [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1961.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I I noticed that the first time I did it. Yeah first time I did it the very first carnivore month month [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1969.2s)]
*  I noticed I was like [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1975.22s)]
*  You know, but I also wonder [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1978.3000000000002s)]
*  Because that was when I went very strict carnivore and I was having a really hard time working out [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1981.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, like my workouts were pretty diminished and I think maybe I wasn't exerting enough energy [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1986.16s)]
*  Because my body's very accustomed to working out really hard almost every day [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1992.88s)]
*  Sure [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1998.24s)]
*  So it's like I've I feel like if you just maintain like if you get your body to a point where it's accustomed to [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=1998.72s)]
*  Like exertion especially explosive exertion. Yeah, it's you kickboxing kettlebells like that kind of my body's very [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2006.0400000000002s)]
*  Custom to that sure and so when I backed off of it [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2013.78s)]
*  I wonder if that is what was responsible because you had this pent up. Yeah [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2016.58s)]
*  Makes sense interesting and then I think on top of that [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2021.46s)]
*  There's the only eating meat thing and then I also think maybe it's not that that gets you aggressive [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2024.18s)]
*  But that the bread and the pasta sedates you that's probably more accurate probably more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2030.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's probably it [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2038.08s)]
*  I feel like crap and I'm not strict on diet like you are anything [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2039.7s)]
*  But if I eat a big bowl of pasta or half a pizza, I'm same thing [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2042.7s)]
*  You know, you just feel like I'm gonna go sit on the couch [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2046.68s)]
*  Like I'm not gonna do anything makes a difference and anybody who says it doesn't is in denial [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2048.42s)]
*  You just really like bread and pasta which is understandable because it's delicious. Yeah [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2052.38s)]
*  I fucking love it man, but I just limit it to treats and I know that I'm gonna get wrecked [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2057.56s)]
*  Yes, I almost feel like it's like me going out and getting drunk [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2062.42s)]
*  Yeah, like I don't like to do that very often [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2065.12s)]
*  But when I do do it like let's go and eat a cake [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2067.1s)]
*  If I have to choose between cake and pasta I go pasta every time oh really yeah sweets are okay [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2073.86s)]
*  Yeah sweets are okay, but like I'll have a small bowl of ice cream and it doesn't seem to affect me very much [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2079.16s)]
*  I don't think it's the sugar and sugar clearly does affect me, but I think the big effect is the bread. Oh interesting [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2084.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think my body likes that and in fact my daughters have [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2091.7799999999997s)]
*  Legitimate gluten and sensitivities allergies. Hmm. Yeah, like they've gone to our just to get tested [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2096.38s)]

*  Like they've always had dogs. So they're they've grown up. Yeah. Yeah, and that doesn't develop an immunity over time [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2116.48s)]
*  I think it does. Okay, but cats didn't yeah, the cat thing is rough with them [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2121.64s)]
*  Yeah, you know like their grandmother has cats in her house and when we go over there like they don't react very well, huh? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2126.7999999999997s)]

*  So it so many times I can't have a name for it when it got stuck [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2467.58s)]
*  He endured agonizing pain for nine hours before seeking help Chinese medics extracted the tool by cutting a tiny [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2471.02s)]
*  surgical hole in his bladder [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2478.98s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2481.3s)]
*  Come from any app I'm sure that idea [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2483.06s)]
*  From an app yeah, why [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2488.06s)]
*  Where would a 12 year old get an idea like oh like tick-tock? He's saying it's a tick-tock thing [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2490.3s)]
*  Their tick-tock is very regulated. I've never used it [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2496.7000000000003s)]
*  You're right. We're just talking out of our ass. It's a good point very good point [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2500.26s)]
*  Candiru yeah, so this you should explain what it is. It's up your dick hole [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2506.5s)]
*  So it's this tiny parasitic catfish in the Amazon and what it does is it's attracted to urea [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2510.52s)]
*  Which comes out of fish skills and it's a parasite [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2516.12s)]
*  So it swims into fishes gills and lodges its spines into those fishes gills to feed but this nasty little bugger [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2518.84s)]
*  Because it's attracted to urea will swim up your urethra [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2525.92s)]
*  Now that's that's that's all fine and well if you if you will, but it has reversed facing spines [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2529.48s)]
*  So once it swims in there's no swimming back out the same spines it uses to lodge into fish gills [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2536.56s)]
*  No, that's a lamprey. That's nonsense [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2543.36s)]
*  but [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2546.7200000000003s)]
*  Once it's lodged in the only way to get it out is to butterfly [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2548.0s)]
*  And lift it out. Oh [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2552.88s)]
*  God, I'm not even gonna say it. How often does that happen? I don't think it's very regular [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2554.7200000000003s)]
*  But yeah, I can tell you when I'm in the Amazon [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2560.08s)]
*  I'm like peeing back and forth just because I'm scared something will like swim up the stream [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2562.1s)]

*  There's a lot of them out there though. Yeah, you know I don't think you have to be that good to be a cult leader [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2698.96s)]
*  No, you could be pretty shitty at it. How do you find your followers? That's a good question [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2703.12s)]

*  Oh that makes sense self-help guru and then you eventually move people into some sort of a communal situation [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2710.24s)]

*  There's so many species of parasitic wasps yeah, that's what's really fascinating like and not only just parasitic in terms of like [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2744.32s)]
*  entering humans, but also in they like [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2752.2000000000003s)]
*  Inject their larvae into plants and logs and shit and can manipulate certain spiders like the brain process [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2755.4s)]
*  Like tarantula wasps which yeah in the states are incredible [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2762.84s)]
*  You know they can come down lay eggs into a tarantula [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2766.52s)]
*  That manipulates the behavior of the tarantula something about the chemicals in the brain chemistry [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2770.24s)]
*  And then the eggs hatch out of the thing I thought it kills the tarantula. It does no not first [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2775.12s)]
*  Yeah, I was confused well. I know [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2780.56s)]
*  I think I'm thinking of something I might be mixing them up with another one too. There's so many [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2783.8399999999997s)]

*  Yeah, it's not crazy with nuts like [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2793.68s)]
*  It's a way what a weird thing that like nature has invented this creature that shoves its babies [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2797.24s)]
*  Yeah, and there's some other creatures body with a needle. Yep. Yeah, look at this [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2804.8399999999997s)]
*  So this is the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2809.7599999999998s)]
*  It says a tarantula hawk one after a tarantula. Yeah, it's a parasitic stinging it from the bottom. Yeah, that's [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2811.92s)]
*  Stand up like that. Yeah, he's like Jack's well. Yeah, he's like oh boy. I'm confused [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2819.6s)]

*  Oh, I think he's I think you're right. It does it does kill. Oh, you're a single egg inside the spider's belly once [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2832.3199999999997s)]
*  It's paralyzed what a fucking nutty [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2839.3199999999997s)]

*  Yeah [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2844.56s)]
*  Well, there's there's so many of them and then there's even more bizarre shit see that when the egg hatches the wasp larvae will eat the spider [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2845.72s)]
*  From the inside out. Yo, so I mean there's even weirder shit, which is fungus [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2853.0s)]
*  Yes, like fungus that like I saw that for the first time recently in India. Yeah, I was finding these [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2858.64s)]
*  hollowed out I forget like exoskeletons of [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2865.6s)]
*  Mantises and all kinds of beetles that had mushrooms growing out of their heads like weird [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2869.12s)]
*  Cordyceps cortis yeah, and it was um, you know, I only know about it what I've read about it and seen I've never it's not saying [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2874.44s)]
*  I've been very deeply involved in but the idea that a mushroom can manipulate the brain chemistry [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2880.58s)]
*  Yeah of a creature of a living creature [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2887.74s)]
*  It's unbelievable. It's wild. Yeah, not only does it manipulate it [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2890.3s)]
*  But when they lay hatch when the spores explode to infect all the other bugs around them, right? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2893.88s)]
*  In like a vast area and it's all it's all transmitted by air [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2901.16s)]
*  So they just have to like be around and then it's like, oh now I got a mushroom growing out my brain [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2905.18s)]
*  And what's also wild is that ants realize this is happening. So they will drag an infected ant far away from their colony [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2909.22s)]
*  Oh, I just so that it explodes on its own. That's fascinating. Yeah [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2917.2s)]
*  I didn't know yeah, they figured it out like how how do ants fucking communicate? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2921.06s)]
*  Cuz if you see like leaf cutter ants, which I have in my neighborhood leaf cutter ants colonies [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2926.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they have underground where there are sophisticated. Yep systems of ventilation and they're literally fermenting [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2931.8599999999997s)]
*  Leaves down there. It's like what I know. How do you know? How are you doing this? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2939.2599999999998s)]
*  How are you building a village and and like some may like just recently? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2943.5s)]
*  I saw this thing where these ants made a rope to cross this [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2947.2999999999997s)]
*  Incredible they linked arms. Yeah, someone's gonna drown someone has to go down [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2952.98s)]
*  They have to think about that when they let go. Yeah, like some shit [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2957.5s)]
*  It's not like everyone's not gonna make it but they don't but that's what's so amazing about things like ants and bees is that hive [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2960.8199999999997s)]
*  They don't all have to make it right right and that's like it's for the greater good of the hive and like yeah [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2965.7s)]
*  Yeah, this is the same exact one fucking bonkers man and army ants build a bridge to invade wasp nest [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2971.74s)]
*  Yeah, look at that and see the see the eggs. They're carrying the wasp eggs out of the nest. Oh my god [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2979.46s)]
*  What a bunch of creeps we were I [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2984.3799999999997s)]
*  She's called the wild times and we were looking at this on the wild times podcast and everybody that [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2987.3799999999997s)]
*  Commented was like there's a rope in the middle of that. That's not real. There's no rope. No, look you can see right through it [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=2993.9s)]
*  That's what's crazy. Yeah, that is just bodies. That is just ant bodies working in this hive mind to figure out how [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3000.42s)]
*  Collectively to accomplish a task as one unit. It's a long rope. That's pretty stupid [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3008.58s)]
*  I guess they probably had to just swing over there. I don't know. Yeah, how did they swing over there? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3014.42s)]
*  How is it connected? Yeah, how are they doing? I don't know. How did they swing? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3019.9s)]
*  Imagine how fucking strong the ants at the very top that are hanging on to the board holding the hole holding a giant [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3024.6600000000003s)]
*  Robe of ants. Yeah, they're all a bunch of eggs. You can see right through it. Look at that. It's unbelievable nuts [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3031.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's really nuts [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3036.42s)]

*  biomass of ants [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3044.58s)]
*  I think the biomass of ants on earth is equal to the biomass of humans. Oh really? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3046.18s)]
*  I thought it was actually more I thought there was more biomass of ants than there are of human beings Wow [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3052.66s)]
*  Is that true? Let's find out that it's pretty impressive enough with eight billion fat [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3057.58s)]
*  So human correct and these little little things. Yeah way as much as us. Why they weigh more that's even crazier [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3062.54s)]
*  I used to work on a project [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3069.5s)]
*  It says the ant biomass is around 20% of human biomass or the mass of carbon from nearly 8 billion humans now living [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3076.2599999999998s)]
*  That's I don't understand what it's saying. That's carbon. So I don't know why I brought that up [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3083.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm also weighs around 12 megatons, which is about the equivalent of two pyramids of Giza on a scale Wow [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3086.98s)]
*  That's cool [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3093.7s)]
*  That's two two pyramids of and this other thing says ants make two-thirds of all the insects. Hmm [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3095.22s)]
*  Really? So it's only 20% of the biomass [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3102.3399999999997s)]
*  Human biomass. Oh, I was totally wrong [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3106.18s)]
*  Sounds better when you say as much. Yeah, let's go back to the other way. Yeah [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3109.74s)]
*  Even 20% when you see how fucking little they are. Yeah, I know I mean what are they what one millionth of a human? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3114.2999999999997s)]
*  If that right? Yeah, they weigh nothing [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3120.2999999999997s)]
*  I used to work at the California Channel Islands in front of Santa Barbara where I live and one of the projects that I worked [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3122.3399999999997s)]
*  On for way too long was ant eradication [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3128.56s)]
*  So they they were trying to restore the Channel Islands back to you know before human settlement [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3131.2599999999998s)]
*  and really just rewild them and keep them pristine and [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3136.42s)]
*  The most difficult species to remove hands down were the Argentinian ants. So all over California [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3139.46s)]
*  We have these invasive Argentine ants and they you know on one boat or another they'd made it over to the islands [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3146.04s)]
*  And it's just like how do you remove that? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3151.82s)]
*  You know, it's easy to remove pigs or sheep or whatever from an island because it's a closed off area [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3154.2s)]
*  But trying to remove [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3158.74s)]
*  Millions of ants. I mean, it's just it's massively difficult Channel Islands [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3160.58s)]
*  I think is the Channel Islands used to be a big bow hunting destination. Yeah. Oh, yeah [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3165.22s)]
*  Yeah, cuz they used to have a bunch of different [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3170.1s)]
*  Species that someone had brought over there at one point in time like elk and deer and yeah [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3173.1s)]
*  And they killed them all like from a helicopter [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3177.66s)]
*  So there was elk on Santa Rosa and then Santa Cruz, which is the biggest one had sheep and pigs [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3180.1s)]
*  I think goats as well back in the day and then you know, even Catalina still has bison and [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3185.34s)]
*  For a while they opened up farmed right there. Yeah, they're not what I mean, they're like semi wild, right? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3191.58s)]
*  They they just reproduce but it's all very managed [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3196.98s)]
*  But for a while they opened up like tag hunting like come out and get your elk and get your pig [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3200.18s)]
*  Yeah, but then eventually the state just said like it's we got to do something about it [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3205.18s)]
*  And this was kind of interesting the pigs on [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3209.7s)]
*  Santa Cruz Island, have you heard about the Judas goat? Do you know what that is? Yeah, so they did explain that [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3212.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Judas goat is what happens when you can't they did in Galapagos, right? I think so [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3217.2s)]
*  I think that might be where it started [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3221.9s)]
*  But the Judas goat is a process in which say you're trying to eradicate goats from an island [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3223.4s)]
*  Well, the goats wake up they get they get aware that there's a helicopter buzzing overhead and somebody's shooting them [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3228.88s)]
*  They all start scattering and getting scared and it becomes harder and harder to get the last 10% [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3234.04s)]
*  So 10% of the work is eradicating 90% of the animals and then 90% of the work is getting the last 10% of the animals [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3238.92s)]
*  So they do this thing called a Judas goat where they go and catch a goat [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3245.12s)]
*  Put a collar on it and then let the goat go and the goat finds its friends [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3248.56s)]
*  100% of the time and they mow down all of the other animals and leave the Judas goat who then pops over to the next [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3253.7999999999997s)]
*  Group of goats. So you're a real shitty friend if you're the Judas goat or you just dumb as shit [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3259.44s)]
*  You being manipulated by people true. I think they castrate them too. Yeah, I'm sure [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3264.48s)]
*  Yeah, but [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3268.7599999999998s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, so the Channel Islands they they got rid of all the sheep got rid of the goats if there were goats [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3270.6s)]
*  I'm not sure turkey a few other things but they couldn't get rid of the pigs [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3275.3199999999997s)]
*  And so they brought in hunters for a while [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3278.64s)]
*  They opened it up pig guys came and shot them and then they tried to get guys like I think actually from here from Texas to [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3280.7999999999997s)]
*  Come and fly and shoot the pigs and stuff and the Channel Islands Santa Cruz Island particular so canyons and difficult [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3286.92s)]
*  They're having a really hard time and for whatever reason they brought in these helicopter pilots from New Zealand [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3292.46s)]
*  Who fly the fjords down there and I was lucky enough to work on some of these projects? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3297.96s)]
*  So I was actually in those helicopters going through these slot canyons and stuff. It's really cool. I wasn't doing any pig shooting [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3302.6s)]
*  I was going in for ants like I said in weeds and some other stuff and [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3308.04s)]
*  Yeah, and the the helicopter pilots and shooters from New Zealand were the ones who managed to take out the final pigs on Santa Cruz [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3311.6s)]
*  Pigs can have three litters a year. Yeah, that's what's nuts [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3317.6s)]
*  Well, we have what is it six million pigs in the United States now. They came from 11 [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3321.28s)]
*  Yeah [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3328.4s)]
*  11 pigs that were dropped off in Florida in the I think mainland, Florida [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3329.84s)]
*  Maybe the keys but 11 pigs is what they believe and that was by the Spaniards, right? Correct. Yeah. Yeah nuts [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3333.68s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? I mean that's crazy [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3339.64s)]
*  But maybe it's even crazier the fact they brought smallpox as well and killed 90% of the Native Americans. Yeah, that's that's nuts [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3342.08s)]
*  That's a little worse. Yeah, when you tell people that when because so many people most people are aware [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3349.88s)]
*  There was a genocide of Native Americans [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3355.6s)]
*  Sure [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3357.6s)]
*  But most people are not aware that most of it was due to disease [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3357.88s)]
*  Right when I had explained that to someone that it was 90% of the people were killed by smallpox or what? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3361.08s)]
*  And it was purposely introduced disease, correct? I don't believe so. Oh, it just came. Yeah with people [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3366.04s)]
*  Yeah, just came with people interesting. I don't think they really understood how to introduce diseases back then [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3371.16s)]
*  I idea that they thought that you could have it on a blanket. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think that's true [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3376.6s)]
*  Let's find that out I believe that myth has been busted but they know now that that's what killed off the Mayans [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3382.52s)]
*  Yeah, like cuz there was always this big mystery like where the Mayans where did these people do this incredible civilization? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3389.96s)]
*  So complex. Yeah mimic the cosmos in their architecture [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3395.2400000000002s)]
*  There's no evidence that the scheme worked [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3399.88s)]
*  This is regarding the blanket infection of the blankets was apparently old [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3402.6000000000004s)]
*  So no one could catch smallpox from the blankets besides the Indians just had smallpox [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3406.28s)]
*  Smallpox had reached for pit and it come from Indians and anyone susceptible to smallpox had already had it [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3411.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3417.12s)]
*  I just think I think it was just a thing that people had and they brought it over and then they killed everybody [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3417.6s)]
*  It also killed everybody in the Amazon and people here in the in the Americas had no tolerance to it [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3423.08s)]
*  Right because they hadn't evolved alongside the disease which had evolved over thousands of years. It was a nice ears [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3428.96s)]
*  Yeah [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3434.52s)]
*  They had no natural immunity to it [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3434.7200000000003s)]
*  And then that's also what they believe was responsible for decimating the Amazon [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3436.16s)]
*  Like they think the Amazon had millions of people the Incans and the Mayans and all those things just all those people [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3441.2s)]
*  I didn't realize that that's really interesting. Yeah, the really wild stuff that's being done on the Amazon is lidar [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3446.56s)]
*  Oh, I know where they're finding all this evidence of these ancient structures that were just overcome by the jungle [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3452.24s)]
*  Have you seen the Honduran lost city of the monkey god? Yes [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3458.46s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, there's a like legit full civilization [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3462.86s)]
*  Yeah on Doris like a bustling city that they found in lidar two or three years ago using lidar two or three years ago [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3467.3s)]
*  It's empty empty [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3473.2200000000003s)]
*  But like a full scale city not not like a village or a town like like tens of thousands. Yeah, look at that [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3475.06s)]
*  Fucking wild. Yeah, but it totally makes sense man. If you bring in smallpox [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3481.82s)]
*  I mean smallpox kills like 90% of the people to get it, right, right [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3486.2200000000003s)]
*  So it just fucking decimated the populations of these places where these European settlers made through [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3489.9s)]
*  That's the whole story behind the lost city of Z [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3496.3s)]
*  You know, I yeah [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3498.54s)]
*  Well, I knew that the city went away and yeah, you know Percy went to look for it with his son and his son's friend [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3499.7400000000002s)]
*  Blah blah blah, but I didn't realize that the idea that smallpox had wiped it out [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3504.78s)]
*  Yeah, the reason behind well the theory behind it is and all sorts of diseases not just smallpox [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3508.96s)]
*  But that when the Europeans first came through when they first reported about these in me immense cities, they were there [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3513.94s)]
*  Yeah, they were there [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3519.42s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3520.26s)]
*  And so then when people came back like a hundred years later like this bullshit, right? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3520.5s)]
*  Because the jungle would just overcome everything and it can in so little so little time. It's crazy [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3524.58s)]
*  The rate of growth, you know when the jungles left alone is unbelievable [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3529.54s)]
*  And then there's the weirdness that the jungle itself is actually man-made [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3533.34s)]
*  Whoa, hold on. I don't know. I didn't know that no tell me. Yes most of the plants that are [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3537.98s)]
*  overwhelming the rainforest are from [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3544.46s)]
*  Agriculture from ancient civilizations [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3547.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's like the ice cream bean tree and a bunch of other different trees [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3549.5s)]
*  But these trees were all trees that had been grown. Yes, it is actually man-made [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3554.46s)]
*  One of thousands of earthworks built by remarkable but little known ancient societies the Amazon prior to the arrival of Europeans in the Americas [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3559.62s)]
*  And 1492 is commonly depicted as a pristine wilderness dotted with small simple communities Wow [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3567.54s)]
*  Go the Amazon rainforest created go. Yeah that click on that one [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3574.9s)]
*  This supposedly pristine untouched Amazon rainforest was actually shaped by humans over thousands of years [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3580.54s)]
*  Native people played a strong role in molding the ecology of this vast wilderness [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3587.02s)]
*  So these trees that overwhelm the rainforest they were planted. They're cultivated [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3591.9s)]
*  Yeah, and then they just they became they just run amok interesting [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3598.04s)]
*  They're just really fertile and the ground [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3601.78s)]
*  They had developed this type was it called terra Prada [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3605.7400000000002s)]
*  Terra Prada is that what it's called. They had developed a very specific type of soil that they they actually it's oh, yes [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3610.6200000000003s)]
*  I know about this and we've been unable to replicate it. Yes. I do know a bit about that. Yeah [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3618.1000000000004s)]
*  But but I guess the different [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3623.78s)]
*  But I guess the difference being those were all native plants, right? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3626.78s)]
*  So while the Amazon may have been cultivated by different tribes in the Amazon [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3630.98s)]
*  They're not getting those plants or trees from anywhere, but the immediate surrounding area, right? [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3635.1s)]
*  I mean maybe not immediate but within the South Americas. I'm not exactly sure right? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3640.02s)]
*  I'm like they're importing olives from Spain, right? They're using the resources. Yeah, I don't think they're saying they're invasive [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3644.6s)]
*  I'm just thinking they're cultivated, but that's fascinating. Yeah, because you you certainly don't think of that and you don't think of at least in today's world [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3651.1s)]
*  I don't think of the Amazon as being populous. I mean, I'm not talking about Manaus and you know cities [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3658.18s)]
*  I'm talking about the wild Amazon. You don't think of [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3662.94s)]
*  Civilizations being able to impact that. Yeah much fastness Graham Hancock thinks there's 20 million people living in it 20 million [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3665.98s)]
*  Yeah, wow, that's what he thinks. It's a it is a vast [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3673.02s)]
*  Society well, it was filled with human beings and structures and and this is all being like they have only used lidar and a very [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3677.7799999999997s)]
*  Small percentage of the of course, yeah, and they're showing all sorts of structures Wow [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3685.14s)]
*  Irrigation systems and grids that indicate cities and blocks. It's wild stuff man [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3690.5s)]
*  I mean it sort of makes sense in the sense of the abundance of resources down there, right? [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3695.3599999999997s)]
*  It's easy to grow a population when you have so much natural resources everything that you plant grows, you know [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3701.7599999999998s)]
*  There's sort of there's another side of that argument that I've heard paleontologists make we're like when things are too easy [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3708.54s)]
*  People don't evolve right? That's a different side of that coin [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3713.86s)]
*  but if you think about it from like a logical standpoint of [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3717.02s)]
*  When things are easy, it's easy to increase your population [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3720.42s)]
*  And you know when you're not fighting for survival every day because there's coconuts and palm trees and blah blah blah blah [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3723.78s)]
*  It's easy to reproduce and have more kids and grow a society [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3729.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, versus when you're spending half of your life just trying to get by that's an interesting argument [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3732.3s)]
*  Then when things are easy that people don't grow or evolve that seems weird to me because it would seem to me that [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3736.9s)]
*  Once your resources were taken care of once you have food and shelter you have more time to think [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3743.1s)]
*  So you have more time right make life convenient more time to sell goods [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3748.7s)]
*  That would be valuable to people more time to improve and innovate on those goods [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3753.62s)]
*  But the argument is when things are too easy, you don't push the status quo [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3758.3s)]
*  So because there are so many abundant resources you have no need to develop tools and technologies that advance society [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3763.58s)]
*  So the argument I don't remember the scientists that said this it's basically if you look along the band of the equator [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3771.28s)]
*  Those are at this time and this is an older older publication [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3776.96s)]
*  I believe those were the least developed societies in the world as you get further away from the equator [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3780.84s)]
*  You know up into the arc not the Arctic but like up into Scandinavia and so on and so forth you get more and more [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3785.98s)]
*  advanced civilizations [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3791.84s)]
*  because when there's a hard winter coming or [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3793.5600000000004s)]
*  It's just harder to survive even though there's abundant resources you need to [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3796.36s)]
*  Adapt and overcome and develop in order to prepare for that winter in order to prepare for a [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3800.76s)]
*  Famine time period versus when it's all just available to you at any time the reason why that doesn't make any sense is Egypt [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3806.2400000000002s)]
*  Sure, yeah, it doesn't make any sense because that's the absolutely most sophisticated culture [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3813.1200000000003s)]
*  But pre what we understand of history. Yeah, you know, but not on the equator [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3818.4s)]
*  It is quite far from the equator far from the equator, but it's also like very [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3822.94s)]
*  Very lush very like the Nile Valley they think you know 9,000 plus years ago was like extremely lush [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3827.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, which is one of the reasons why they were able to reach this high level of sophistication [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3834.0400000000004s)]
*  Because they had access to resources which aligns with the idea that the Amazon had the same thing [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3838.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and I agree with you by the way [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3843.2200000000003s)]
*  I think that if you have an abundance of food and resources you have a better ability to create [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3844.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that that makes more sense to me, but I don't think they're mutually exclusive [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3851.0s)]
*  I think things could exist [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3854.76s)]
*  I agree like you could have it too easy or you could have it to the point where [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3856.5200000000004s)]
*  There's plenty of food to hunt and gather and you see no need to move out of the hunter-gatherer stage [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3860.96s)]
*  Sure, but then you could also see like super sophisticated [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3866.96s)]
*  Societies that lived in that area like they think the Amazon was right, right that they would they would innovate totally [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3871.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3878.6400000000003s)]
*  You have a large population even if it's a small percentage of people innovating [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3879.6400000000003s)]
*  It's gonna it's gonna impact the the great number of people if you have enough people [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3883.54s)]
*  There's gonna be people that are creating right? There's no way they're on. Yeah, and then people came through there with their [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3888.38s)]
*  Coffee and everybody fucking killed them off. That's that yes, really wild man [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3894.54s)]
*  It's really wild if you think if that is true that how horrific that is that they just basically [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3898.82s)]
*  Reset everybody back to the Stone Age and if you think about has that happened before and will it happen again? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3904.74s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I remember distinctly thinking well at first [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3911.02s)]
*  I think I told it might have told you the story when kovat hit I was in Indonesia and I was like [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3914.18s)]
*  This is stupid. It's like bird flu. It'll all be over in ten days and boy was I wrong [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3917.86s)]
*  But I remember shortly after that distinctly thinking like this might be the beginning of the collapse, right? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3921.7599999999998s)]
*  Like this could be where human population collapses like this is the plane that the planet has been waiting for this is our this [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3928.34s)]
*  generation of smallpox [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3935.54s)]
*  But it it obviously science and medicine overcame that at too fast of a rate and it really wasn't that lethal [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3936.54s)]
*  But I wasn't it was the fact that it wasn't lethal, right? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3943.02s)]
*  Even if science and medicine didn't do anything it wasn't gonna kill everybody off true [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3945.82s)]
*  But I remember thinking because there's a lot of hysteria around. Yeah, you know, I remember thinking maybe this is it [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3949.38s)]
*  But I guess my point being do you think that that's gonna happen again? It certainly could [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3953.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it has before it probably will again. I mean I was scared of it too in March of 2020 [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3958.22s)]
*  Oh my god, that's going down right when they were shutting the country down totally Jesus Christ we're living in a movie everything [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3963.54s)]
*  Yeah, you couldn't go into a hospital. You couldn't like visit a grocery like everything [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3970.4s)]
*  It felt like the whole world was collapsing. The problem is there was an [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3974.14s)]
*  irresponsible level of fear that was promoted by the media because the media has an [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3978.82s)]
*  interest in getting you to pay attention to what they're saying and [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3985.06s)]
*  That irresponsible level of fear the problem with that is like even if they know what they're doing [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3988.18s)]
*  They know that it's propaganda people get sucked in right and then they get scared forever [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3993.1s)]
*  and if you don't ever give them good data and you're always [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=3999.98s)]
*  exaggerating the threat and exaggerating the death number and exactly dr. Lena Wen who was like the biggest [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4004.58s)]
*  proponent of you know, shut everything down shame the [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4011.98s)]
*  Unvaccinated cast them out of society now she's saying that they they [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4016.34s)]
*  What is like her she had a recent article where she said they [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4021.74s)]
*  overestimated the amount of people that actually died from COVID and [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4026.5s)]
*  I think she said the real number is about [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4030.06s)]
*  30% of what they're claiming. Oh, you're kidding [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4034.1s)]
*  Oh, because when you die of COVID if you also have cancer if you're dying of something else [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4036.2999999999997s)]
*  But you test positive for COVID they called a COVID. They call it a cover death. Yeah, I remember reading that even [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4043.86s)]
*  Accidents and even people that like because there was a financial incentive. Yeah, it was just part of the problem [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4048.52s)]
*  Dr. Lena went slammed after admitted there's been an over counting of COVID deaths two and a half years late [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4055.0s)]
*  When claimed the actual COVID-19 death could be only 30% of what's currently reported [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4060.8799999999997s)]
*  There's also been I mean, I don't know how the system exactly works, but there there's been doctors that explained [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4066.7999999999997s)]
*  What incentive there is to put someone on a ventilator what incentive there is to prescribe remdesivir [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4075.3599999999997s)]
*  Because it all it's all financial decisions, right? Yeah because of the emergency use authorization [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4082.3599999999997s)]
*  Because the pandemic there's all these and when you have money involved things get fucking squirrely [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4087.56s)]
*  Oh, I get real weird and always and then I didn't real like I'm so ignorant [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4092.64s)]
*  I didn't know that most hospitals or a large number of hospitals are privately owned. Mmm, they're businesses [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4096.84s)]
*  Yeah, I was like what yeah, you're like, wait a minute [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4103.96s)]
*  I thought like where's this money coming from something that like the government funds so that we all take care of each other [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4106.32s)]
*  Not here. Not no country. Yeah. No. Yeah, I have the fact that [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4112.2s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies are responsible for 75% of the ads on television [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4117.4s)]
*  Really? Yeah, 75% [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4121.8s)]
*  75% of the ads on television [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4123.88s)]
*  We don't one of two countries on earth that allows pharmaceutical companies to advertise [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4126.92s)]
*  The other one is New Zealand and they're far more restrictive than we are hmm [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4131.679999999999s)]
*  And yeah, you have like so much so much and then every and we lost people in terms of like losing their mind and their [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4135.2s)]
*  Anxiety that never came back. Yeah, like I just saw an article today about how I think it's time to mask up at award shows again [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4143.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, fine that I was like what the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, it's a cold, right? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4150.139999999999s)]
*  It's basically gotten down to a cold to the point. Yeah, it's become so benign. Yeah human beings [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4155.48s)]
*  That vulnerable you shouldn't be going to the award show in the first place [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4160.84s)]
*  Yes, if you're not healthy like right and also right right smart choices, right? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4165.200000000001s)]
*  Protect yourself stay back like there's still still after all these years still [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4169.88s)]
*  No [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4175.76s)]
*  Encouraging people to take vitamin D no encouraging people to lose weight [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4177.360000000001s)]
*  No encouraging people to take care of their overall metabolic health so that they'll be have a more robust immune system [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4180.88s)]

*  But when he went to the hospital he was climbing in Utah fell without his helmet and did a skull in and [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4293.84s)]
*  It was terrible Tommy Dutra. He was one of my best friends amazing guy credible athlete [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4300.64s)]
*  Anyway, he went to the hospital and his dad called all of us right all of his close friends and his family and everything else [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4305.240000000001s)]
*  Nobody was allowed in the hospital his own parents had to say goodbye to him over zoom when they pulled the plug [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4311.400000000001s)]
*  all the name was right during the height of it all and [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4317.240000000001s)]
*  Because he was getting out and climbing and doing something active during the pandemic [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4319.8s)]
*  you know when everybody else was sitting inside his own fault for not wearing his helmet so on and so forth, but [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4324.64s)]
*  Terrible tragedy, but just imagine not being able to say goodbye to your son [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4329.92s)]
*  In that situation because of that whole heightened like we're talking about the heightened fear thing right the heightened hysteria [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4334.96s)]
*  If it wasn't even kovat positive it doesn't even make sense, but they weren't allowed in the hospital. Yeah [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4341.4800000000005s)]
*  Unbelievable so I mean there's two tragedies simultaneously right the big ones that he died hitting his head of course of course yeah [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4347.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah poor guy [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4356.16s)]
*  But he died doing what he loved though he was an incredible climber and very passionate about it, so yeah, you know yeah, I talked to [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4360.12s)]
*  Gabor mate about that who's an expert in addictions and trauma and he thinks that people that are [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4368.88s)]
*  Drawn to like free solo climbing like the Alex Honnold steps the world the addiction of the yeah [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4376.96s)]
*  Yeah, he's like there's something wrong with the way they developed sure they're muted and like maybe because of so much [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4384.28s)]
*  Persistent trauma when they were young oh interesting need some I forget exactly how he described it [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4392.68s)]
*  But that this is a reaction to trauma like youthful trauma [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4398.1s)]
*  So they're putting themselves in traumas way or harm's way to compensate for something that's happened historically putting themselves in [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4402.52s)]
*  Trauma's way because that's the only way they feel things yeah [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4410.400000000001s)]
*  I mean I that's the only way they feel alive like they get this [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4413.8s)]
*  And I don't know how you feel what someone else feels right? How would you know that yeah, right? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4419.280000000001s)]
*  I mean I can sort of understand that in a sense of like I'm not an adrenaline junkie like I don't go for [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4425.240000000001s)]
*  Skydives or you know any of that stuff it doesn't drive me [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4430.66s)]
*  But that thrill and rush I get of you know darting a bear or working with a lion or doing you know swimming with an anaconda? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4433.860000000001s)]
*  Like that fuels me for weeks like I [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4440.66s)]
*  Getting goosebumps thinking about some of them right now because I get so excited [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4444.62s)]
*  By and it's not just for a personal rush, but rather you know we're doing it for work or whatever [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4448.26s)]
*  But those moments stick with me forever, and I sort of get that but not like I'm just gonna [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4452.88s)]
*  Risk my life over this climb or whatever you know what are your thoughts on? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4459.46s)]
*  Giant anacondas like because there's always been this thing about enormous anacondas that live in the rainforest [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4464.02s)]
*  So yeah, there's fascinating so I love anacondas [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4471.22s)]
*  I believe and I've got a colleague Brian Frye in Australia actually and he has a similar belief that there are 30-foot anacondas now [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4474.8s)]
*  30 is a big anaconda, but you're talking about those mysterious like [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4482.68s)]
*  100 footers okay, so [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  Take out the Amazon and take out anacondas for a second okay all right [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4489.28s)]
*  Think about where all the largest snakes are in the world, Florida [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4493.6s)]
*  You know we've got all these wet tropical environments that have that house these huge stakes in Indonesia [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4499.16s)]
*  You have articulated pythons you have Burmese pythons you have African rock pythons Indian rock pythons anacondas all these big snakes [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4504.76s)]
*  Yeah, the only place that has a wet tropical humid [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4510.7s)]
*  High density of prey environment that doesn't have a massive snake is the Congo Central Africa [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4515.32s)]
*  Now interesting stay with me [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4523.04s)]
*  These that area is home to some African rockbite and stuff and not big monster anaconda size ones right but [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4525.679999999999s)]
*  During World War two there was a colonel who flew over there, and this is a well-respected colonel [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4533.0s)]
*  I'm sure Jamie you'll be able to find this very quickly a well-respected like I forget [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4539.28s)]
*  He had like his wings or his patch of honor or whatever like very distinguished who him and his two passengers in the plane [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4543.26s)]
*  Both reported a hundred foot long snake they flew over at once they're like wait a minute [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4550.38s)]
*  What is that they were there were Dutch Belgium in the Congo? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4556.34s)]
*  They flew over at once went [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4559.26s)]
*  What is that and flew over it two more times to verify it and got so low to the ground that they said the snake [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4560.64s)]
*  Struck at the airplane and all three people the pilot this well-respected colonel and the two passengers [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4566.3s)]
*  Had the exact same story of this giant snake in Central Africa [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4572.679999999999s)]
*  Interesting yeah, and yet no big snake has ever been proven from there, but it's also a very poorly biologically explored area and [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4577.36s)]
*  Most of the time when these animals get this big snakes or otherwise. They're in very low. Yeah, here's the picture [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4585.96s)]
*  They took a photo of it. Did yeah, they did [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4591.719999999999s)]
*  They're in very low densities so [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4595.0s)]
*  Hmm, that's the real photo over on the left there. What do they think it was? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4598.04s)]
*  They thought it was a giant snake a 50 foot long, so that's the photo right there. I believe so [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4602.44s)]
*  But the story is fascinating of these kernels. They don't know like what kind of snake [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4608.599999999999s)]
*  They don't know if it was no condor no Python [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4612.66s)]
*  Or it would be an undescribed species because the only snake there the African Rock python doesn't get that big [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4614.98s)]
*  What is the biggest snake that we know oh it says it measured? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4620.36s)]
*  Approximately 50 feet in length saw brown green with a white belly has a triangle shaped jaw on a head [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4624.4s)]
*  Three by two feet oh my god [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4631.36s)]
*  The photo was later analyzed and verified to be genuine van leered [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4635.8s)]
*  Claims that is how you say his name [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4640.96s)]
*  I'm not sure but that was that was the Colonel Remy van leered as he flew lower for a closer inspection the snake rose up [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4642.84s)]
*  Approximately ten feet giving a warning that it would have attacked a helicopter if it had been within striking range [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4649.68s)]
*  But imagine flying over and having a snake sort of lunge at a helicopter [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4656.2s)]
*  Three-foot snakehead Jesus Christ Jamie do you mind going to my Instagram? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4661.4s)]

*  Now to think of yeah, like you said to buy like you're like a you're like an M&M to a snake that you're a tic-tac [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4678.12s)]

*  Indonesian villagers claimed to have captured a python that is almost 49 feet long and weighs nearly [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4703.0s)]
*  990 pounds I've seen this it's not there's no it's not verified at all [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4709.52s)]

*  This might be the one that's on the tractor. No, it's not [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4715.96s)]
*  There's a fake one on a tractor that it's fake floated around. Well. It's just very forced perspective [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4719.76s)]
*  It's like a wide-angle lens and the snake is right in front, but it looks massive, but this is NBC [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4724.88s)]
*  This is NBC News. Let's see if it has images this sucker [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4730.24s)]

*  So there's quite a lot of 20 foot snakes out there, and then there's a couple [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4758.88s)]

*  And there's nothing that's been verified outside of one skin [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4769.64s)]

*  It was 49 feet long make it the longest ever caught, but that the fine turned out to be a tall tail [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4787.46s)]
*  Yeah, so how big was it I bet it was 20 ish 21 there it is yeah 21 feet still yeah [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4793.18s)]
*  It's a big snake man, but not 50 not 50 was a I have no idea why the snake has shrunk [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4799.12s)]
*  I said one keeper when asked about discrepancy as the snake lounged on a tree branch inside the cave [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4804.52s)]
*  But things do shrivel up when you catch them. You know like fish do like when you catch a fish [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4811.14s)]
*  Yeah, well definitely when you tell people about it, but [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4816.6s)]
*  Yeah, I went fishing here in Austin this morning. Oh, did you really right downtown literally right in front of the Google building [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4821.68s)]
*  Lady Bird Lake yeah, that's out there. It was awesome. Yeah, it's great little spot [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4828.76s)]
*  Yeah, really fun right in front of the Google building right in front of it. Yeah, yeah [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4832.599999999999s)]
*  Um so the biggest in the world is the python right so they are bigger than anacondas [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4836.639999999999s)]
*  So it's sort of a toss-up the reticulated python has been clocked as the heaviest snake in the world because they get fatter [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4841.5599999999995s)]
*  But the anacondas have been clocked in slightly longer. I think [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4847.36s)]
*  26 feet is the longest ever recorded did you ever see the Jennifer Lopez movie? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4851.24s)]
*  the documentary [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4856.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's great [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4859.2s)]
*  Corny movie it's so good the bad like snakehead if you watch it so bad so bad so bad [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4861.44s)]
*  But that was always the rumor is that there was enormous snakes in the Amazon and that you know you just didn't see him [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4868.04s)]
*  I I do believe that there are some mega fauna out there that are yet to be found that are in low [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4873.84s)]
*  Population you believe in the sloth the giant I believe that has a and again. That's like the thylacine. It's a proven animal [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4881.2s)]
*  It's been ten thousand years, but it doesn't mean that it couldn't be extant in certain remote areas [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4887.16s)]
*  Same with some of these big snakes [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4891.4s)]
*  Maybe not 50 because maybe these things are embellished, but maybe 30 maybe 35 right and I just think that there are a few [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4893.0s)]
*  Not a lot of these big things out there if you're one of these [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4899.68s)]
*  Uncontacted Amazonian tribes of which there are still several pop West Popuan tribes whatever and you're seeing a 50-foot snake [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4903.84s)]
*  Nobody in the Western world. We're not hearing about that right [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4912.18s)]
*  You know like those things can be happening and those stories get embellished and passed on and all of that [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4915.08s)]
*  But we wouldn't even know until Western science gets in there [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4919.76s)]
*  And it's sort of a double-edged sword could once it does it sort of ruins certain aspects of that right so [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4922.84s)]
*  but I do believe that there are big animals to be found still and the [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4928.04s)]
*  Sloth one I watched a documentary on it once it was this guy who was like risking his reputation [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4932.32s)]
*  He was a biologist and he had spent months in the Amazon. He was very frustrated [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4937.12s)]
*  Yeah, because he couldn't find anything they kept saying we saw it we saw [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4941.96s)]
*  I know that feeling well [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4947.72s)]
*  And it's very frustrating because you know like I've even had people tell me they've eaten the thing that I'm looking for [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4949.56s)]
*  Really? Yeah when we were doing extinct you know looking for the extinct animals [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4955.0s)]
*  Of which we were had success quite a lot, but I've had guys be like oh, yeah, yeah, they're delicious [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4959.12s)]
*  I'm like what would like tell me where to find it like you've eaten it [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4964.4400000000005s)]
*  And you have no reason to lie about this whatsoever like please just help me [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4968.84s)]
*  What was this that they did that was regarding that caiman remember that yellow? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4972.8s)]
*  Yeah, and we did find them so that worked out [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4976.16s)]
*  But literally I remember we're walking through the village in day one before we even get in the canoes [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4978.68s)]
*  And I'm like showing people these pictures of all the different species of caiman, and I kept pointing to the [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4983.32s)]
*  Trump a largo Amarillo the long-nosed yellow one right and [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4989.08s)]
*  Everybody's like yes, no maybe one time and then one guy's like oh those are delicious, and I'm like oh god [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4993.04s)]
*  Can we put this on animal planet? I don't even know [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=4998.56s)]
*  Can you say that this thing is? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5002.080000000001s)]
*  endangered species [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5004.96s)]
*  Well there was always these rumors of like these places where these [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5007.200000000001s)]
*  Billionaires would fly into in China and eat like gorilla yeah, and yeah, have you ever heard of that? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5010.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've heard about I believe it too. Do you really do yeah? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5016.320000000001s)]
*  I think that especially you know you say like especially with China where the Eastern medicine and the status symbol of eating tiger [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5019.72s)]
*  Whiskers and this that and the other thing there's a status symbol of eating something that's forbidden right very difficult to acquire exactly exactly [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5026.68s)]
*  And you know China has so many billionaires now [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5033.860000000001s)]
*  I forget what it is, but dozens and dozens of them right like if if that's [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5037.08s)]
*  Status symbol is important to someone with that much power and money. How are you not getting it? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5042.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's what a weird culture where you your your status is based on eating something that's endangered [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5047.96s)]
*  It doesn't even click in my head like I cannot [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5054.36s)]
*  Physically understand it like no part of me is like oh I get that like I really want to eat some tiger whiskers [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5057.599999999999s)]
*  Have we ever talked about the Bondo ape? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5062.44s)]
*  Yes, you have yeah, I know you like the Bondo ape a lot. Yeah [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5065.12s)]
*  Big lion-killing apes well. This is a big chimpanzee that lives in the Congo. Yeah, which is the Congo is so incredible [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5069.36s)]
*  It's like God what an insanely rich resource ridden place [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5076.4s)]
*  That's also a war zone and being and being [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5080.82s)]
*  Absolutely raped and pillaged by you know big corporations in the Western world for resources [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5084.86s)]
*  Yeah, and minerals and I had said Darth Kara on who his book. I think his book comes out [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5089.9s)]
*  Does it come out next week? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5096.74s)]
*  Some's out the end of January okay, but his book is all about cobalt mining. Oh interesting. It's [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5099.259999999999s)]
*  I do want to read it. Yeah [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5106.98s)]
*  horrifying [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5109.179999999999s)]
*  19 year old girls with babies on their back [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5110.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah, hand chipping cobalt out of the ground and then inhaling all these [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5113.46s)]
*  Toxic fumes and powder this dust and then that is in your cell phone, right? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5121.14s)]
*  That's how the cobalt yep gets into your fucking cell. That's that your Apple Store. It's the new blood diamond [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5127.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's the new and it's funny because I feel like the whole blood diamond thing and you know [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5132.78s)]
*  there's been lots of these things, but it [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5138.06s)]
*  All sort of went away because it got exposed, but I feel like no one's talking about the inhumane [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5140.54s)]
*  Things that are taking place for our modern conveniences [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5148.14s)]
*  It's one thing when it's a luxury like a blood diamond right or whatever, but when it's like oh well [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5151.14s)]
*  I can't live without my iPhone. You know then it's like we're willing to turn a blind eye to it [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5157.06s)]
*  It's like people choose not to accept it because it's it's part of their life [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5162.44s)]
*  Just think about how many people who consider themselves social justice warriors, and they do this complaining on a phone [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5166.12s)]
*  That's made by slaves totally yeah, they're they're they're literally tweeting or texting or whatever their complaints on a thing that is [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5172.5599999999995s)]
*  Contributing to the thing they're complaining about it's well the contributing to the worst version of it in humanity right now [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5180.16s)]
*  Isn't it crazy really crazy? I mean it's like literally human trafficking so in the book does he actually go? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5186.72s)]
*  Into the Congo and witnesses and oh yeah video footage [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5192.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah, his story is so compelling [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5195.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm just listen so or and he talks about it with such passion because he worked on this for years and years [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5198.46s)]
*  Yeah [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5204.34s)]
*  And risked his life to obtain footage and to get access and to go to these what they're supposedly [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5204.820000000001s)]
*  You know ethical minds yeah, and he's like this is all horrible [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5211.9400000000005s)]
*  It goes all of it is tainted yeah all the cobalt that we have all of it is is [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5216.4800000000005s)]
*  At least in some part coming from these [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5221.7s)]
*  You know what they would call [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5225.94s)]
*  It's basically just the most primitive version people in flip-flops with hammers. Yeah chipping it out of the ground [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5228.5s)]
*  What's extreme poverty? Yes, right and and it's more like slavery it is calling it extreme poverty [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5235.14s)]
*  I think is not quite accurate enough. They call them artisanal [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5240.98s)]
*  Minds which is like hilarious because like anytime you slap that word on day anything. It's it's it's fun. Oh artisanal [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5245.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think someone's making pottery somewhere. Yeah, totally totally [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5253.16s)]
*  Yeah, so back to the the Bondo eight is that well? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5257.66s)]
*  What is because I know there was some controversy behind that and there's some people that sort of denied its existence [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5261.74s)]
*  But then Carl Armand got photographs of them and they obtained [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5267.3s)]
*  Skulls that were a chimpanzee skull that had a crash yeah [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5273.14s)]
*  Well, they also had a like like a crest like the same way that a gorilla does [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5277.280000000001s)]
*  My understanding and this is not something I'm super familiar with but there's no denying that they existed right there was this insular [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5282.22s)]
*  Gigantism that took place within this group of chimpanzees there was heightened aggression [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5290.06s)]
*  You know that's all like known and documented, but it wasn't a new species. It wasn't a distinct species [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5294.700000000001s)]
*  it was [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5301.6s)]
*  Sexual or rather natural selection that led to these animals being different and isolated and turning into larger more aggressive chimpanzees [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5303.240000000001s)]
*  That's my understanding of it, but is that what would that also? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5312.68s)]
*  Make their skulls different it can do you know because like okay? Well oddly enough. We have a skull yeah [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5317.0s)]
*  This is made by Shane against the machine who's a guy on the Instagram was an incredible artist [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5324.400000000001s)]
*  Couple pieces for the podcast all right the difference is with this skull versus [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5330.0s)]
*  What they think the bondo ape skull is that the bondo ape has like a bone mohawk right through here [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5336.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, like a gorilla does sure so you know sexual selection over time can evolve for anything can adapt for anything, right? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5341.8s)]
*  It's why peacocks have the silly tail. They have it doesn't help them fly right. It's only sexual selection [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5350.36s)]
*  So you get a bunch of chimps stuck on an island stuck in a region and the females decide for whatever reason [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5357.24s)]
*  That a bump on the head is sexy [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5363.48s)]
*  Okay, now every chimp that has a slight bump on its head is being selected for by the females to reproduce offspring [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5366.12s)]
*  Fast forward 15 20 generations, maybe 200 generations whatever they all have a crest on their head [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5373.96s)]
*  That is how evolution begins [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5380.0s)]
*  Because now you fast-forward millions of years and the sexual selection has been selected for over and over and over and over [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5382.2s)]
*  And you're starting to turn into a new creature a new organism all together if I'm not [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5389.2s)]
*  I don't think I'm incorrect here. I think this the crest indicates enormous mandible muscles [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5395.16s)]
*  I think because the yeah attach up there. Yeah, I think that's what the crest is for yeah [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5401.06s)]
*  Because that's how it is with dogs sure like if you ever notice a difference between a dog [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5406.68s)]
*  That's castrated and a dog that's not fixed [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5410.14s)]
*  Sure the size of their heads oh interesting yeah, my dog is a golden retriever. Yeah, sweetest dog in the world [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5413.54s)]
*  Yeah, he has pretty big head [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5419.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and it's the muscles in his head are big sure on the sides of his head because he has his testosterone sure [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5421.38s)]
*  Whereas we met this other golden retriever that was fixed and he has this narrow little tiny head sure and it's because he doesn't have [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5426.9800000000005s)]
*  Any muscles so that's the difference of sexual selection like the peacock or or what I explained and naturally [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5434.14s)]
*  Selection so if these bondo eat apes are only eating [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5440.26s)]
*  I'm just making this up, and I know I know the theories of them killing lions and everything [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5443.740000000001s)]
*  But if they're only eating coconuts, let's say right [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5447.02s)]
*  They have to rip through a coconut with strong jaws right well if you got weak jaws or weak jaw muscles or weak mandibles [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5450.820000000001s)]
*  Whatever you're gonna die right you know so over time [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5457.3s)]
*  Again the only ones that are surviving are the ones that have this ridge on their head that are naturally being selected for stronger muscles [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5460.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so they just think it's like a subspecies of chimp. That's my understanding. Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5467.78s)]
*  They don't think it's a different chant, but they do think it's [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5474.0199999999995s)]
*  Different in terms of its size and temperament and we see that all the time right we see [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5477.34s)]
*  Insular dwarfism where things are stuck on an island they get smaller and smaller lack of resources or gigantism [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5482.0599999999995s)]
*  For the opposite reason like we see that all the time within species or people live in Iceland [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5487.66s)]
*  Enormous giant fucking people Vikings exactly yeah, and many how world strongman champions have come from Iceland [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5493.72s)]
*  All of them shitload yeah, they're all like that guy the mountain from Game of Thrones. I was just gonna ask you is he from Iceland [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5501.2s)]
*  He's from somewhere up there. Yeah, is he from Iceland? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5507.22s)]
*  Well his name is for my Thor Thor half horse one exactly yeah try saying his fucking name, but I mean that [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5510.4800000000005s)]
*  That part of the world has produced an exorbitant number [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5519.56s)]
*  Besides that fuck yeah, Iceland look at that name though. Yeah, yeah, we're [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5524.280000000001s)]
*  Bjorn and son Bjorn first of all they're not even using real letters no, what's that thing after the [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5529.68s)]
*  That's like a half a P [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5536.2s)]
*  B a real blower half [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5538.400000000001s)]
*  Thor oh, it's literally [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5541.92s)]
*  Transliterated as half Thor in English [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5544.6s)]
*  Yeah crazy that's and that's a different species. I'm sorry. That's a different species [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5547.78s)]
*  Look at that guy. How big is that fucker? It was he six nine or something, but then his weight is astronomical [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5554.74s)]
*  Is he more than that his height six eight I see it there 203 centimeters which like Shaquille O'Neal's [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5562.66s)]
*  Yeah, he's seven one two thirty he's gotta be more than that all right. Oh, yeah, that's nonsense [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5570.5s)]
*  No, that's it. That's not true at all each of his when he floods ways that oh [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5577.82s)]
*  Maybe when he was 16 [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5582.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's when he started basketball he started at 230 oh [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5587.3s)]
*  He's got it well. I think really got yeah, he got really heavy [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5590.9s)]
*  But then he were 60 [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5596.86s)]
*  463 okay, but then he slimmed down to have a boxing match hit a boxing match with Eddie Hall [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5600.7s)]
*  Did he win yeah, he won actually look really good. Yeah, it showed really good technique to wasn't like winging punches [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5606.22s)]
*  He was like fighting like a boxer. I mean they trained for a long time for it [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5612.22s)]
*  I cannot imagine taking a hit from a guy like that no matter who you are [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5615.6s)]
*  Sizes fucking mitts the momentum like coming into that yeah, just the sheer gravity [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5619.38s)]
*  Boom [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5626.02s)]
*  Is fascinating how people in that part of the world I mean they were the Vikings yeah [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5627.42s)]
*  That's that's the why they're so fucking giant where they've come from yeah, that's amazing [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5631.620000000001s)]
*  So I wanted to talk to you about this cloning and the the rewilding and the mammoths and yeah that stuff [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5635.9s)]
*  I'm going to colossal tomorrow to learn a little bit more about it. It's being colossal [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5641.98s)]
*  Yeah, so colossal biosciences is this if you ask me incredible company [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5646.62s)]
*  And they are by their own declaration a de-extinction company, so it's this guy Ben Lamb [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5651.16s)]
*  And he's got George Church. Who's a world-leading [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5657.08s)]
*  Cellular scientist I don't know the specifics [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5661.38s)]
*  You know of the extinction and cloning and crisper and so on and so forth and they've come together and raised a ton of money [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5663.7s)]
*  And they are de-extincting animals and the science is there like it's done all it took was the the money basically behind it [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5668.86s)]
*  And they've put together this incredible rolodex of scientists and people and it's it's it's real-life Jurassic Park with purpose [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5677.0199999999995s)]
*  Where they gonna put them? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5683.44s)]
*  So there's a couple different things going on so the first one [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5684.98s)]
*  They're working on is the woolly mammoth right and this isn't just for fun. This is this has real like [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5687.2s)]
*  Important conservation implications, which is really fascinating [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5692.580000000001s)]
*  But they are going they're planning on [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5696.540000000001s)]
*  Starting with I think a hundred mammoths and putting them in this place called Pleistocene not Pleistocene Park [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5699.38s)]
*  Something like that this park in Siberia [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5705.06s)]
*  That they've been doing this experiment on as to what happens when you add [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5707.820000000001s)]
*  Megafauna back into the Arctic tundra to offset carbon emissions Wow [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5712.42s)]
*  And [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5717.34s)]
*  So they're using what DNA they're using elephant DNA and mixing it with something else [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5718.740000000001s)]
*  So it's it's Indian elephant is the closest living relative to the woolly mammoth [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5724.46s)]
*  What does an Indian elephant look like is it similar to an elephant? Yeah, it's a smaller so African elephants are bigger [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5729.5s)]
*  They have the really big ears right Indian elephants are typically the ones you'd see at the circus [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5735.38s)]
*  You know with the red the pink in the ears the smaller triangular shaped ears, so just a different species of elephant [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5739.9400000000005s)]
*  And so they're taking Indian elephants and they're using CRISPR technology [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5746.160000000001s)]
*  And they're using existing mammoth DNA and they're making an embryo [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5750.400000000001s)]
*  And then they're implanting it into the Indian elephant and 22 months later an Indian elephants gestation period [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5754.4400000000005s)]
*  She will give birth to a mammoth a [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5760.240000000001s)]
*  Real man a real mammoth, so it's not like a hybrid [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5763.240000000001s)]
*  That's okay. That's a good point. So it is in the sense of what they do is if you imagine like [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5767.64s)]
*  If you imagine the DNA of an animal right and then you imagine the fragments that are broken out of it, right? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5773.6s)]
*  What they're doing is they're taking that DNA of the and I don't understand the cellular side of it very well [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5779.6s)]
*  This is just my base level understanding of it [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5785.0s)]
*  I can talk about the conservation side of it [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5787.0s)]
*  But they're taking that double helix that DNA and all those pieces that are missing from the mammoth. They're putting in [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5788.68s)]
*  Indian elephant pieces so you end up with an animal that is [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5796.24s)]
*  Physically and morphologically [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5800.32s)]
*  Identical to a mammoth but has used all of the DNA from the closest living relatives in order to get there [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5803.759999999999s)]
*  Boy and [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5812.04s)]
*  This process how long does this take? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5814.08s)]
*  So I think they've been going for about five years on the science but the science of de-extinction and cloning [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5816.799999999999s)]
*  I mean you remember Dolly the sheep right that was like a known thing. So that's been going on for a long time [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5822.28s)]
*  Well, you can get your cat cloned exactly dog clone exactly for like 20 grand you can clone your dog [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5826.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the son of creepy it is it's bizarre [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5831.4400000000005s)]
*  But the point is the science has been there for a while [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5834.92s)]
*  There's just hasn't really been the funding or the motivation for it [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5838.16s)]
*  But what I what I think so fascinating the reason I'm so like emotionally invested in it is [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5841.4s)]
*  The conservation implications that it has because what they're this company is ultimately doing is rewilding [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5846.2s)]
*  Species that humans have removed and that's going to in theory in a lot of places sort of fix the the the offset the imbalance [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5853.48s)]
*  of the ecosystem [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5861.24s)]
*  That's interesting. That's really interesting. There's a lot of debate about whether or not humans killed off the wooly mammoth though, isn't there? [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5862.28s)]
*  I think there is yeah, I think there is and I can't really speak on that but I do know that when the mammoths disappeared [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5869.0s)]
*  So the Arctic used to be like the savannahs of Africa used to be big grasslands, right? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5876.04s)]
*  It wasn't all covered in trees and things and that's a recent adaptation since the mammoths went away [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5880.68s)]
*  1020,000 years ago and so that's what's happened is the permafrost up there is melting pretty rapidly, right? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5886.4800000000005s)]
*  Underneath that permafrost is like one and a half trillion tons of carbon and once that carbon enters the atmosphere [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5893.12s)]
*  It heats things up like crazy. So with by removing those mammoths [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5899.76s)]
*  You're and I can explain why the mammoths keep it colder [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5904.92s)]
*  By removing those mammoths it's allowing that permafrost to melt much quicker and release more carbon [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5907.5199999999995s)]
*  So the idea from like a financial standpoint of how they make money is the carbon offset of putting mammoths back into the environment [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5912.679999999999s)]
*  How do they make it colder? So it's a couple different things. It's [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5919.04s)]
*  Basically when there's trees and shrubs they take in more heat and that heat transfers into the ground [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5923.5199999999995s)]
*  So in this Pleistocene Park this park that they've been doing this experiment in Siberia for a while [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5930.0s)]
*  They have they put in a couple hundred animals that aren't mammoths, right? They put in ox and [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5935.04s)]
*  Reindeer and things like that and they're knocking trees over with the tractors and once they knock trees over and they simulate a mammoth [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5940.56s)]
*  Knocking the trees and shrubs over the other the fleet grazers are able to keep the vegetation from regrowing [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5946.6s)]
*  So when the vegetation doesn't regrow you get all this grassland and the grassland has snowpack the snowpack gets stumped [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5953.04s)]
*  So there's no insulation it reflects more light [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5960.24s)]
*  It just it's like it's like three or four different processes that make the ground I think on average [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5962.88s)]
*  It's like eight degrees colder. So it keeps things more frozen [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5968.0s)]
*  So once we removed all the megafauna from the Arctic through hunting or maybe other means regardless once they were removed [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5971.1s)]
*  The Arctic got warmer the Siberia and Alaska got warmer and so slowly we're getting more and more carbon emissions from up there [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5977.92s)]
*  But by putting these animals back and I just love the idea of going up to the Arctic and it looking like the African savanna [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5984.4800000000005s)]
*  Right with all these incredible animals [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5989.5199999999995s)]
*  But by putting these animals back it in theory will make the Arctic colder [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5991.179999999999s)]
*  Slow down the melting of the permafrost which will in turn trap the carbon for longer in the ground [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=5996.12s)]
*  Mmm, so they're gonna start with the woolly mammoth [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6001.48s)]
*  Yeah, and what are there what other animals are they thinking about doing this to? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6004.08s)]
*  So what I know of right now is the woolly mammoth and the thylacine, which is another reason I'm so they are gonna bring back [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6007.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and how are they gonna do that? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6013.32s)]
*  So there's [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6015.88s)]
*  It used to be the qual but now it's an animal called a dun art [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6017.280000000001s)]
*  That's the closest living relative and so, you know thylacine were around pretty recently, right? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6020.04s)]
*  I mean, we're just looking at video of one [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6024.820000000001s)]
*  so they have really good DNA from the thylacine and then they're gonna use the [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6026.06s)]
*  Existing DNA from a dun art, which is a very small marsupial put them together [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6031.12s)]
*  remake the thylacine the only problem is my understanding is [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6036.280000000001s)]
*  They cannot use the dun art for surrogacy because the dun arts are like this big [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6039.2s)]
*  So they have to do an artificial womb and all of that, but yeah, I think [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6043.2s)]
*  Yeah [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6047.4s)]
*  Is there crazy we're living in this time? Yeah, it sounds like a horror movie [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6049.5199999999995s)]
*  But it's so insane like yeah, even five three years ago if you're like, hey, we're bringing animals back [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6052.72s)]
*  We're gonna put mammoths back in the Arctic. You're like shut up like go put on your tinfoil hat like it's happening [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6057.639999999999s)]
*  When are they projecting the first woolly mammoth will be? [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6062.82s)]
*  Launched 2024 what? Yeah next year next year end of next year. Oh my god [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6066.2s)]
*  Yeah, and they're gonna bring it to Siberia and put it in this Pleistocene Park where there are all these other animals and they're [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6072.08s)]
*  Gonna see how it does like how does it behave? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6077.66s)]
*  How does it interact with the environment does it does it replace the tractors in the sense of cooling down this little park area? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6080.08s)]
*  Yeah, it'll be gonna be saber-toothed tigers. I hope so. No, I don't know [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6087.12s)]
*  Wild animal those must have been to look at saber to giant teeth [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6094.32s)]
*  Yeah, literally hang out of their mouths and apparently they're so sensitive that they could find jugulars [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6098.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they could fit they could feel the pulsating jugular with their teeth just because of the nerve endings [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6106.18s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that that's amazing home. Ethereum, right? That's what the [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6111.74s)]
*  Genus was called. I don't know. Yeah, and that stuff like that's the fun Jurassic Park side of it [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6116.12s)]
*  Right, like what I like to see a saber-toothed cat. Yes [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6121.78s)]
*  But the the idea that like hey ten years from now [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6124.92s)]
*  There's gonna be several thousand thylacine back in Tasmania facial tumor disease is gonna go away the over [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6129.2s)]
*  Abundance of prey is gonna disappear facial tumor disease facial tumor disease is a thing that a lot of the animals and particularly the [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6135.04s)]
*  Tasmanian devils have in Tasmania [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6142.68s)]
*  It's herpes on the face, but it comes from an over abundance of prey because the alpha predator the thylacine has been knocked out [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6145.0s)]
*  So if you go drive down a road, yeah, look at it poor bastards. It's bad. It's herpes. It's actual herpes [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6152.56s)]
*  Horrible and that's the Tasmanian tiger which is what the Tasmanian devil sorry Tasmanian devil [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6162.4800000000005s)]
*  What a crazy little animal that fucker is they're so cool, and then noises they make [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6167.64s)]
*  Yeah, they're wild see if we can find a recording of Tasmanian devil noises [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6173.0s)]
*  Yeah, but anyway, I'm just excited because it's like this it seems like we live in an alternate universe where these things are real now [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6178.36s)]
*  Which is just so crazy compared to a few years ago. What does it? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6185.44s)]
*  Here we go [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6188.86s)]
*  Look at those little fuckers [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6204.9s)]
*  They're going mouth to mouth with each other if you're camping in Tasmania [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6207.0599999999995s)]
*  Which I've done for thylacine searches and stuff and you hear that it is the most like blood curdling [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6211.5s)]
*  Terrifying and then they're this big [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6217.46s)]
*  But you hear this and you're like something is going to rip me to shreds [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6219.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, look at them. Yeah, they're real cute really cute. Does anybody ever have them as pets [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6224.42s)]
*  One if you can domesticate them, I don't know but my number one pet's a wombat [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6230.54s)]
*  Have you ever seen a pet wombat? No, they have them. Oh my god people have miss pets [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6234.860000000001s)]
*  I mean in Australia like as rescues and stuff. I don't know [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6238.7s)]
*  I don't know if they're in the pet trade, but I went to a place in South Australia [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6241.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a little Tasmanian devil [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6247.22s)]
*  Look, he's a little puppy. They're adorable [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6250.58s)]
*  They are so the people but this is like little tiny babies like I wonder what what you know [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6253.18s)]
*  It's maybe it's like some animals like you get to a certain age. You can't really keep them anymore [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6258.900000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't think they'd make very good pets [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6262.900000000001s)]
*  I went to a place in Tasmania where they dragged a wallaby carcass in that had been hit by the road [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6265.14s)]
*  It was like the cartoon version of piranhas, you know where they come in [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6269.860000000001s)]
*  And they rip it to shreds these things ripped this dead wallaby to nothing it was like maybe ten of them in [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6274.42s)]
*  Under a minute just to nothing to just bones and gnawing. It was [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6281.179999999999s)]
*  wild to see [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6286.139999999999s)]
*  Most people think of the Tasmanian devil is that cartoon? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6287.66s)]
*  That's literally when people think about that [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6291.179999999999s)]
*  It's one of the only animals where the cartoon is more popular than the actual animal agreed [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6294.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah agreed like I couldn't pick that animal out of a lineup if you tell you I mean [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6297.94s)]
*  Now I can cuz I'm looking at it right now. Yeah, if let me hear some volume [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6302.24s)]
*  The only way about seven kilos gotta love Australians, yeah [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6311.0s)]
*  Cutie that's a wombat here. Look look look look this is what I'm talking about [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6317.48s)]
*  That's a wombat. Yeah, that's a juvenile one, but they're just little trucks little cutie. I love wombats [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6321.24s)]
*  I think they're so adorable. I'll keep those as pets as adults. Yes, they do. There was a woman [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6328.12s)]
*  I met who had one in her house [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6333.599999999999s)]
*  Man, we had this video on on our little podcast that don't know how to find it [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6336.0s)]
*  But it was hilarious and this woman hand raised this wombat and it ran around her house like your dog does [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6340.5199999999995s)]
*  But the thing is it's like this truck, you know [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6346.76s)]
*  They're like super low to the ground huge shoulders and like if it decided to run like through the dog gate or through the [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6349.32s)]
*  Refrigerator it just went like bowling straight through it. It was amazing [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6356.92s)]
*  I think they're so cute, but these guys have [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6361.88s)]
*  Unbelievable mange in Tasmania like Jamie if you type in, you know wombat mange [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6366.0s)]
*  We've looked at a lot of gross animal stuff today, but it's like it's brutal and the reason the mange is so bad [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6370.28s)]
*  There's no predators and they're way overpopulated [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6375.88s)]
*  And so when there's that many animals in a small environment with overpopulation they get diseases and so [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6378.08s)]
*  Yeah, so all this is potentially fixable, you know if you put a predator the right predator back in Tasmania, right? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6384.52s)]
*  And so that would help Tasmania and are they looking at doing this to other continent? Oh, that's terrible [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6391.16s)]
*  That's what they look like though that image you saw for a split second there [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6397.16s)]
*  That's what they not all but that's what a ton of them look like in Tasmania with this rampant mage [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6401.08s)]
*  Well, that's the chupacabra straight up. The chupacabra is a coyote a mangy coyote horrible mange [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6405.96s)]
*  Yeah, and they've captured them like people we can't [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6412.24s)]
*  And it's sitting in a cage all terrified. Fuck. I was swollen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just a fucked-up coyote. Yep the [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6415.8s)]
*  North American mammals like are they planning on eventually doing that? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6423.76s)]
*  North-american mammals as well and reintroducing some I'm not sure well the mammoth would be in Alaska. So that's [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6428.64s)]
*  Siberia all the way to Alaska [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6435.84s)]
*  So they that that mammoth step environment those grasslands used to range from Spain all the way to [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6437.04s)]
*  North America like all across the Bering land bridge and all that ice was like [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6443.28s)]
*  Trompled and blah blah blah all these savanna lands that are now big forests [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6448.08s)]
*  Are you aware of the Alaskan Boneyard? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6452.28s)]
*  He did you watch that I heard pieces of it because a couple people texted me about it [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6456.12s)]
*  But I need to listen to the whole show. I mean, it's John sounds like a fascinating guy. He's the best [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6460.2s)]
*  Yeah, but his place that he has in Alaska like they've been on and it's not a big area where he's finding this stuff [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6465.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's got two areas and one of them that he's been getting bones what he calls boning this one area for [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6473.759999999999s)]
*  Decades. Yeah is only six acres. That's all it is dude. It's nuts the the [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6481.839999999999s)]
*  Concentration so that's what it looks like [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6488.08s)]
*  It's like the side of a cliff and they blast it with water until you see things and then they pull out [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6490.08s)]
*  These bones, but they've they found animals that were not supposed to be there. I remember he said that yeah [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6495.64s)]
*  He said like I believe [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6501.96s)]
*  So scimitar cats were the cat that was native to that continent to Alaska, right? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6504.32s)]
*  Not saber tooth saber tooth big teeth scimitar is like a smaller tooth version and then he's found [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6509.08s)]
*  Saber-toothed skulls. Yeah on his property. Yeah, so all of history all of humans are like, oh no, there's only scimitar cats in Alaska [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6515.0s)]
*  They were never saber tooths and he's found actual saber tooth. Yes, and he's only looked in six acres [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6521.02s)]
*  Can you imagine crazy? Yeah, I mean his [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6526.56s)]
*  They don't know what is was going on in that area. Like why are there so many dead animals? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6529.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and why did they all get like frozen into the permafrost into one spot? Yeah, right mean tar pit or who knows? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6533.88s)]
*  I've connected him with Randall Carlson [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6541.28s)]
*  Look at that. Yeah, that's gotta be a saber tooth. Okay, that's a cave lion [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6545.599999999999s)]
*  Cool. I don't know if they thought that was there too. So I've connected him with [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6550.5599999999995s)]
*  Randall Carlson arm in the process of doing that and [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6555.639999999999s)]
*  Randall is a proponent of the younger dry ice impact theory and the younger dry ice impact theory is [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6558.719999999999s)]
*  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,000 years ago. There was some impacts from comets [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6564.599999999999s)]
*  Probably wiped out most of the animals that we're thinking about like North American megafauna [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6568.799999999999s)]
*  Like 65% of them were wiped out somewhere around that time period from he thinks are wiped out from common impact [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6574.5599999999995s)]
*  Interesting things that's why you're finding these massive storages of these dead animals in this one specific area [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6581.2s)]
*  So so why would that funnel animals into one area because they were already there, but they died all at once [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6587.48s)]
*  I see so it's like so it's not like over the years, right? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6593.639999999999s)]
*  It's like an instantaneous mass die-off a great and he's got [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6597.22s)]
*  Photographic evidence of these mass die-offs as well too [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6602.5s)]
*  Because one of the things that they found in terms of with woolly mammoths [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6605.780000000001s)]
*  They found enormous like fields of them where they've not just found like one dead one [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6610.1s)]
*  But hundreds of them and they find them with broken legs, right? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6615.860000000001s)]
*  And he thinks that's an indicative of the impact sure of whatever happened. I mean, it's almost like a bomb going off [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6618.9400000000005s)]
*  They just get [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6625.14s)]
*  Right smack back [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6626.6s)]
*  but that these things most likely died in mass and [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6628.14s)]
*  That this area where John Reeves has in Alaska is a particularly [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6632.660000000001s)]
*  Fertile area particularly rich area for finding these skeletons and it makes sense, right? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6638.46s)]
*  Like why else would you have 300 dead animals with fractured bones in one spot? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6643.38s)]
*  Exactly, you know or whatever the numbers are but and he has so much [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6647.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he has thousands and thousands of bones and [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6651.94s)]
*  many many many many full tusks of woolly mammoths [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6656.0599999999995s)]
*  Which are worth millions of dollars right? He's got millions of dollars worth of tusks. Yeah, he's got them all over the place [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6660.54s)]
*  It's just stacks of them. They find them all the time jaws jaws. Yeah, so it's the bone yard [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6665.54s)]
*  Alaska, right? It's got the flat grinding teeth. Yeah. Yeah. Look at those teeth man. They're incredible [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6671.78s)]
*  Yeah, so it's the bone yard Alaska on [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6676.9s)]
*  Instagram and he's got it very detailed and he's invited me up there actually sent me a message after I think our first show [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6680.46s)]
*  Somehow we got on the same topic and he sent me we talked about him and he said he got [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6687.5s)]
*  15,000 new Instagram followers conversation good for him. That's great. He's like, alright [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6693.139999999999s)]
*  I'm only gonna talk to Joe wouldn't tell my whole story and so we had him on [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6697.0199999999995s)]
*  He's he wasn't you know, he's wealthy like he doesn't have to talk to people about stuff. He's choosing to yeah [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6700.5s)]
*  Just does it because he wants to yeah, so like he won't talk to journalists [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6706.82s)]
*  He's getting all these phone calls from New York Times these people he's like fuck off [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6710.82s)]
*  Well, I read a thing the day or two after you guys did your show that he started like a bone rush [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6714.5s)]
*  Yeah, the East River of New York people going to look for bones that have been dumped in the East River. Apparently they were yeah [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6719.98s)]
*  According to the records they dumped a shitload of them and he gave out the very specific location [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6727.219999999999s)]
*  So now there's guys combing the bottom with radar and looking for these things really interesting [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6732.78s)]
*  Do you know if anybody's found anything yet? I don't believe anybody has yeah, you know, that'll be fascinating [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6737.62s)]
*  It's been there for it wasn't it the 1930s that they did this [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6741.78s)]
*  40s yeah [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6745.7s)]
*  Look at this treasure hunters search New York City's East River. Haha, isn't that funny? This all came from my stupid [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6748.219999999999s)]
*  Show [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6754.34s)]
*  Reporting this like it's look at this look it even says spurred on by Joe Rogan podcast [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6758.62s)]
*  Look at that the New York Post there was show me some love. Oh nice [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6763.58s)]
*  That's so funny. Yeah, no, that's incredible [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6767.18s)]
*  I I don't know that whole extinct megafauna thing the fact that North America [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6769.68s)]
*  We used to have cheetahs and giant llamas and like huge lions that are bigger than African lions [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6774.200000000001s)]
*  Like the amount and the abundance too it wasn't like today we have great animals in North America [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6779.42s)]
*  But the abundance is so much lower than southern Africa, but it used to be like something like eight times higher [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6785.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, can you imagine like just walking? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6792.38s)]
*  Imagine like this wasn't here in Austin you decided to walk three blocks and you saw like 500 giant animals [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6795.0s)]
*  Yeah, that used to be here. Yeah nuts. Have you ever heard of the American Prairie Reserve? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6801.700000000001s)]
*  Prairie Reserve, I don't know what it's called Jamie. What is that thing? We're never talked about that. They're trying to [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6807.0599999999995s)]
*  They're trying to buy up [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6813.0199999999995s)]
*  Massive swaths of land and reintroduce bison. Yeah, American Prairie [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6815.7s)]
*  So they're gonna reintroduce bison and a bunch of different animals to this area and they even doing block management in these places [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6821.0599999999995s)]
*  hmm, and [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6828.66s)]
*  They essentially want to rewild [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6830.26s)]
*  Some of the Great Plains I think that's great man. I think rewilding is the key to conservation in the future [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6833.62s)]
*  I mean there have you seen that in go scroll back up, please so I can read that Jamie [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6840.22s)]
*  It says bison used to number in the millions on the Great Plains [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6844.9s)]
*  But animals and conservation herds now stand at around 31,000 [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6848.0599999999995s)]
*  They're considered near threatened because most conservation herds are less than 500 on small landscapes a species is listed as [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6851.66s)]
*  Ecologically extinct meaning bison no longer play their critical roles in shaping prairie biodiversity [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6859.38s)]
*  So what they want to do is bring them back. Yep and [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6865.9400000000005s)]
*  Allow them to influence the environment [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6869.74s)]
*  Yeah help the ecosystem only an estimated 360,000 bison were made in North America today of [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6871.74s)]
*  These less than 10% live in conservation herds most of the bison on the landscape today are raised for commercial purposes [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6877.9400000000005s)]
*  And what's really crazy is they got all they got down to like almost extinct. Yeah. Yeah, they got real close to 100 [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6884.66s)]
*  I think yeah, there's an incredible place the Bass Pro Shops headquarters in Springfield, Missouri [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6891.28s)]
*  The guy Johnny Morris the guy who runs it he's built a museum next to the Bass Pro headquarters like it [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6896.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like a personal museum [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6901.94s)]
*  But anybody can go to it and his big thing is the bison and so you walk through this hallway [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6902.94s)]
*  and they have all these ancient pictures of the bison and [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6907.94s)]
*  Like these piles of skulls guys used to stand on a literal you could probably find it Jamie [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6911.139999999999s)]
*  There's this picture of these two hunters that killed [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6915.66s)]
*  I don't know how many bison but it's literally a mountain of skulls that they're standing on top of and because they used to I'm [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6918.0599999999995s)]
*  sure, you know, that's just sit on the railway and ping them off and all of that and [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6923.82s)]
*  anyway, it's just fascinating the [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6927.66s)]
*  Amount the abundance of those animals that used to be in the American prairie [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6930.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the pictures of people standing on piles of bones are so are revolting [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6933.82s)]
*  It's so gross like what they did and the the quickness in which they did it where they almost [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6938.98s)]
*  Eradicated the bison from North America and you know, they weren't even eating them [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6944.94s)]
*  No, they were eating tongues, right and they were getting the skins from some of them later on [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6948.86s)]
*  But a lot of it they were doing it for the tongues [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6953.5599999999995s)]
*  well, and I don't know if you know this or not, but the majority of the reason they killed him was in order to [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6955.5s)]
*  Diminish the survival of the Native American people. Mmm. Is that really the majority of it? I believe so [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6961.0599999999995s)]
*  That was the the big motivator at least in the early days to kill bison was because it allowed the Native Americans to survive off [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6966.18s)]
*  Of that animal right because they were so reliant on them [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6974.22s)]
*  So they're like there were all these campaigns like go out and kill the bison head out West have fun [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6976.26s)]
*  Shoot them from the train because if you depleted those numbers the Native Americans were forced to move or they just didn't have one of the [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6980.700000000001s)]
*  Reservations exactly. Yeah, and so it was a very ugly thing and that part of it sort of covered up, right? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6987.5s)]
*  They sort of that that doesn't get spoken about a lot [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6992.72s)]
*  It's a it's a I mean it most certainly was a tragedy but like almost like [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=6995.2s)]
*  inexcusable to the point of [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7002.0s)]
*  Extinction, I think got so close. I'd say it's inexcusable. It was obviously inexcusable. I don't mean inexcusable like unfixable [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7003.68s)]
*  Yeah, and if you that's a better word [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7011.12s)]
*  sorry, I when you look at the size of the piles of bones that they were standing on and [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7012.28s)]
*  Like that they didn't see that this how fucked up this was I don't believe that you know, we always say [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7017.5s)]
*  Oh, we didn't realize like we thought it would last forever [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7023.4s)]
*  I don't believe but especially because it happened in one generation. Yeah, right quickly very quickly [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7025.839999999999s)]
*  I don't believe that those guys whomever they were whether they loved hunting didn't love hunting loved shooting bison [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7031.599999999999s)]
*  Whatever, I don't believe that they couldn't tell that they were having a massive impact. Oh, they had to quit [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7037.04s)]
*  Yeah, they had to I mean if you're shooting millions of them, right? Just nuts. Do you are you aware of? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7041.5599999999995s)]
*  Dan Flores [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7048.24s)]
*  Dan Flores [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7050.0s)]
*  He's a professor I think out of New Mexico [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7051.8s)]
*  I think I think one of the universities in New Mexico, but he had a paper that he wrote called [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7055.4400000000005s)]
*  Bison ecology and bison diplomacy. Okay, and his [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7062.92s)]
*  his belief is that [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7067.96s)]
*  Would you look at the millions and millions of bison that were in North America at one point in time with these massive herds? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7071.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's like that is not [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7078.16s)]
*  Historically [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7081.12s)]
*  It's not what people initially saw when they first came to North America [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7083.12s)]
*  And he believes the reason for that is that the Native Americans when they got knocked down by 90% [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7089.08s)]
*  They were the primary predators of the bison sure and said then the bison numbers rose to these extraordinary [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7096.2s)]
*  Numbers sure and that it was due to the fact that these Native American populations had been killed off by [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7103.08s)]
*  Smallpox that allowed yeah, so he it's his belief that with the use of the horse and [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7110.280000000001s)]
*  With the use of rifles that Native Americans on their own were on their way to extirpating the the bison [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7117.68s)]
*  I don't I don't doubt it [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7125.820000000001s)]
*  You know there's quite a lot of species throughout history that have gone extinct at the hand of man that were already [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7127.08s)]
*  Even without man like not even Native Americans. I mean no no human being they were ready [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7134.32s)]
*  Their timeline was running out like they were on their way out. The great awk is a great example [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7138.32s)]
*  What is that? So is this basically a penguin from the north as a because you know penguins are from the southern hemisphere [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7142.84s)]
*  There's like basically a penguin from the northern house spell it a UK great awk. Is there a photo of those fuckers? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7148.28s)]
*  I don't think there's any photos, but there's a lot of [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7154.94s)]
*  artist illustrations great awk [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7157.9s)]
*  Yeah, beautiful beautiful bird and they real penguin like very yeah, and they provided oil and and mostly down meat as well [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7159.9800000000005s)]
*  But mostly down so there was a huge rush. I've actually held that specimen [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7168.06s)]
*  But there was a huge rush for awk down for their feathers [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7173.02s)]
*  But these animals they numbered in the millions when humans quote-unquote wiped him out, which they did [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7177.78s)]
*  I'm not saying they didn't but they only see their range over there on that range map [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7183.58s)]
*  They see the red one see the little spots those are actually so their range was massive [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7187.94s)]
*  But those 19 or whatever spots you're looking at are their only isolated populations [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7192.58s)]
*  So while there were millions and millions of awk [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7197.5s)]
*  They only lived in like 19 spots and what that means is they were on their way to extinction [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7199.94s)]
*  Already from other forces because they used to have this vast range [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7205.74s)]
*  And then it was isolated into these handful of isolated populations and then humans found them and wiped them out [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7209.9s)]
*  But had humans not found them likely over another million years or so maybe less [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7216.66s)]
*  they probably were on their way out because they were already isolating into these small pockets and [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7221.099999999999s)]
*  The I'm blanking on it now the gillimot. Is it the gillimot? No, it's a different bird was out competing them [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7226.26s)]
*  Another native bird was out competing them not the gillimot. I'm blanking on what it's called now [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7232.9s)]
*  How did people kill off the passenger pigeon because it wasn't the passenger when there are millions and millions of passenger pigeons millions millions [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7236.78s)]
*  Yeah, they used they said they'd black out the sky right here right here in Texas. Yeah, so one they were hunted tremendously [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7243.759999999999s)]
*  But the main reason that they totally went extinct was they were such a flocking bird [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7249.94s)]
*  That once their numbers were reduced to the point that they couldn't have such large flocks. They weren't successful any longer [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7256.34s)]
*  So they they weren't able to continue their normal behavior once their flock density got too low [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7263.1s)]
*  So it wasn't like they shot every I think they did shoot every last passenger pigeon, you know [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7269.700000000001s)]
*  Like down they shot the last one [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7274.42s)]
*  But it wasn't the last one because they had shot every single other surviving one [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7276.22s)]
*  It was the last one because we shot him up and then their population started to decline and once their their [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7281.740000000001s)]
*  Population got to a certain like capacity [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7288.08s)]
*  They no longer had the ability to behave the way that they had typically behaved in these huge flocks and that was making them [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7290.839999999999s)]
*  Unsuccessful, how did they not know that they were on their way to get rid of them? How did they not know that that was happening? [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7296.759999999999s)]
*  Again, I don't believe they didn't I think they did isn't it crazy how different people look at things like wildlife conservation today [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7302.0s)]
*  Yeah, first is just a few hundred years ago. It's like whoops guess who killed all the bison. Yeah [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7308.82s)]
*  Totally, you know, that's why radical conservation like the you know, bringing back mammoths and [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7313.660000000001s)]
*  Rewilding wolves and stuff like that like that. We need that Joe. Yeah, it's conservation. I'm sorry and is gonna upset a lot of people [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7319.46s)]
*  I don't give a shit. We fucking suck at it [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7326.200000000001s)]
*  We've been doing it for like a hundred years and we are losing every single year. We are not winning [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7328.660000000001s)]
*  There are small little with successful stories. Don't get me wrong, but on a grand scale [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7333.9400000000005s)]
*  We are losing the conservation game. So radical conservation [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7338.46s)]
*  I don't care what it is coming up with crazy science experiments and bringing stuff back putting wolves and the else of whatever it is [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7342.54s)]
*  Trying something is better than not trying anything and continuing down the path [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7348.1s)]
*  We've been going the only animals that were really good at conserving are the ones we want to eat [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7352.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, the ones we want to shoot. Yeah, so like there's more white-tailed deer in North America today than there were when Columbus arrived [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7356.14s)]
*  Right and that's fine hundred percent because of hunting it is and also because of agriculture [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7362.94s)]
*  Right because they flock to these agriculture areas cornfields. That's why yeah like places like Iowa [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7368.14s)]
*  Yes, all these farms like there's so many deer giant deer in Iowa, right? Yeah, but that's fine [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7373.02s)]
*  You know placing a monetary value on an animal in order to save it is great [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7378.18s)]
*  But nobody's gonna start hunting Tasmanian tiger Tasmanian devils, right? Like what for so there are I completely agree with you [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7382.06s)]
*  I'm I'm pro hunting when those funds are used the right way [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7389.820000000001s)]
*  They can be mismanaged and they are all the time especially in places that are more corrupt but yeah [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7394.54s)]
*  It's actually amazing the job that wildlife biologists have done in this country and conservation [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7398.900000000001s)]
*  so absolutely country like they're really pretty goddamn good at setting up like [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7403.900000000001s)]
*  the not the correct number of tags and making sure that oh, yeah habitat is preserved and [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7409.62s)]
*  allocating that money for rangers and wardens and making sure that these people you know, like [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7415.18s)]
*  Monitor these animals and stop poaching and I in North America [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7421.259999999999s)]
*  We are very good at it like on a global scale. Yeah, the problem is we always [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7426.0199999999995s)]
*  Doesn't matter if you're North America or anywhere wait until the very end to do it [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7430.66s)]
*  We wait until shits really bad, right? Oh, there's only 12 of them left or whatever now. We're gonna put in all this effort [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7434.38s)]
*  It's like yeah being preventative instead of reactive is is the ticket moving forward and we are starting to make that shift [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7439.94s)]
*  You know, I am so interested in seeing what they decide to do if this really takes off in Siberia with the woolly mammoths [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7446.26s)]
*  If they reintroduce them just not just in Alaska, but then bring them into Montana [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7453.14s)]
*  I bring them into you know [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7457.46s)]
*  The lower 48 and then start reintroducing other things if they can figure out how to do that with a saber-toothed tiger [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7459.14s)]
*  That would be fucking so scary [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7465.1s)]
*  They're they're talking about I think I might have these numbers wrong [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7468.740000000001s)]
*  But I believe they're ten or maybe twenty year goal is [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7472.26s)]
*  600,000 mammoths over like 1.3 million miles so covering that whole you know, because the thing is [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7475.58s)]
*  600,000 man, it's a lot of mammoths, but they'll start reproducing on their own right? [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7482.7s)]
*  It's not like they're gonna make them all tourism involved. I mean how many people would want to go and travel to see woolly mammoths? [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7486.3s)]
*  We're going you and I are going to see them a hundred percent. Yes [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7492.860000000001s)]
*  Go yeah [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7497.58s)]
*  I wonder if there's gonna be like groups of people that want to hunt them with spears and like put like long cloths on [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7499.18s)]
*  Fine, it's just like the whitetail dude who cares if that fun is it [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7506.3s)]
*  They say it going you can hunt them [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7509.900000000001s)]
*  But you can only hunt them using the tools and weapons that were available when they were alive barefoot in the Arctic with us [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7511.740000000001s)]
*  What is that? No boots fuck you no tents fuck off like you can have a teepee [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7517.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you got to make it yourself with the mammoth. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, that would be wild [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7523.26s)]
*  People would do it would you do it no no fuck that dude? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7528.9s)]
*  Hunting with a bow and arrow is tricky enough hunting with a spear fuck off. That's crazy [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7533.1s)]
*  There are people that do it though right there are spear hunters like that's a thing hunters [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7537.38s)]
*  No, I mean as a sport assholes. Okay. Yeah, I mean it's not [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7541.94s)]
*  Good too unsuccessful. Yeah, it's like you're not good at it [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7546.06s)]
*  They used to be legal to a hunt with a spear in Alberta [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7549.08s)]
*  Until a guy killed a bear with a spear and made this awful video about it [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7553.18s)]
*  It was a big deal and then under armor [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7558.5s)]
*  You know got in trouble because like they didn't support these people that were they weren't even really sponsored by under armor [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7560.66s)]
*  These people since they there was just like this recent thing with them with poaching and they're they got [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7567.26s)]
*  Accused of poaching and I think they got sentenced to probation and they're not allowed to hunt in certain states [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7573.58s)]
*  It's like why would you hunt with a spear like it hunting with a bow and arrow is very effective [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7579.58s)]
*  Sure, if you're disciplined and like I am very accurate with a bow [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7584.3s)]
*  I can shoot I shoot an index card that I set up at a target [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7588.04s)]
*  Regularly at 85 yards and you're consistent. Yes, and I'm consistent. I practice every day [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7592.780000000001s)]
*  It's not like this is not a thing where with a rifle much more accurate sure and I'm much more consistent [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7597.34s)]
*  It's much easier to do so you could make the argument that it's it's better to hunt with a rifle [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7605.12s)]
*  I definitely could see that but if you do the work and if you are disciplined enough and if you practice enough [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7610.08s)]
*  And if your technique is right, you can be very very effective with a bow [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7616.78s)]
*  I mean you can go out there and see all the skulls I have. I mean, yeah [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7621.7s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of them. Yeah elk with bows and arrows and a lot of deer. I eat them all [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7624.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is a very effective way to get me but a spear is so inefficient [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7627.96s)]
*  And you're naming the animal and you're not gonna kill it quickly, right? [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7633.56s)]
*  You know [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7638.240000000001s)]
*  I mean unless you get the drop on one that's sleeping right five feet away and you chuck it right through the rib cage [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7638.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but quickly what's the likelihood of not very likely? [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7644.76s)]
*  Yeah [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7647.200000000001s)]
*  The likelihood is that you're gonna wound this thing and then you're gonna like chase it down [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7647.52s)]
*  Then you're probably gonna stick it again and right and it's miserable for everything [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7651.8s)]
*  Yeah, this guy think he threw a I think the spear he threw it out a GoPro on it [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7655.84s)]
*  Okay, so you got this horrible? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7660.76s)]
*  It was all for social media. It was all for the clicks like and then they made it illegal [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7663.16s)]
*  So now it's illegal in Alberta to hunt with a spear because this one individual. That's probably I think it is good [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7668.08s)]
*  Yeah, like you use a rifle right bow and arrow, right? You know, you can kill them very easily with a bow and arrow [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7674.08s)]
*  I mean they allow baiting up there. Got you because they have to reduce the populations [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7680.280000000001s)]
*  They have a very high number of black bears up there. I very high and so they use baiting [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7684.2s)]
*  Which is they'll set out like doughnuts sure sure and the bears smell it and the bears come and you can shoot two bear a year [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7689.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah, so you're there, you know [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7696.799999999999s)]
*  There's then they're trying to give out tags because they want people to hunt these things is the number of black bear [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7699.84s)]
*  Overpopulated due to them eating people's garbage due to not enough grizzly bears [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7706.599999999999s)]
*  Like why why are there too many black bears? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7710.759999999999s)]
*  Population is increasing too to the point where they're making an argument that you should have tags for grizzly bears [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7713.08s)]
*  My friends John and Jen who live up in Alberta [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7717.48s)]
*  Been up to their place before they're seeing a lot of grizzlies now. They're seeing them all over the place [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7722.12s)]
*  Oh interesting, but they but by far more black bear [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7726.5199999999995s)]
*  But you know what the biggest population of black bear in North America is where New Jersey [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7729.78s)]
*  Really more black bear per capita in New Jersey than anywhere else in the country. They're everywhere [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7734.28s)]
*  I've had an ongoing. I don't know if you've seen any of this on my Instagram stories [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7739.799999999999s)]
*  I haven't posted on my page, but I have had an ongoing battle with a mother black bear in her cub [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7743.72s)]
*  Have you been seeing this? No, it's really hard in my yard in Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara. Yeah, there are a lot of them [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7748.04s)]
*  I've lived there for 15 years. I saw one once on a hike on a hillside and then six months ago [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7753.76s)]
*  I wake up there's all this ruckus, you know, I'm fast asleep [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7759.280000000001s)]
*  I'm what's going on the dogs bark and I head outside and there is a black bear on top of our chicken coop [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7762.8s)]
*  Ripping the panels off. Whoa, and I run up to it. I'm screaming. I'm like I get out of your bear [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7768.08s)]
*  I'm in my boxers. I don't even have a light on nothing because Santa Barbara nothing like happens at night there [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7772.64s)]
*  Right, and we have an acre and so it's you know, pretty spacious [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7777.400000000001s)]
*  But it's all fenced in this black bear is torn through our fence come in [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7780.56s)]
*  Rip the chicken coop to shreds killed my kids favorite chicken killed all the other, you know [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7784.72s)]
*  They killed like we have like 20 chickens. Well, we did then now we have like five and [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7788.64s)]
*  Has just been gone through these chickens. And so I scare that bear off. I'm like that was an anomaly [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7792.56s)]
*  I'll never happen again happens again the next night. Well now they know where the chicken now [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7797.160000000001s)]
*  They know happen constantly but so I've been trying all these non-lethal mitigation methods, right? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7801.5s)]
*  So I've been I've been we reinforced the fence didn't work. I put up [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7806.1s)]
*  These motion these proximity alarms that worked at least for a few months bear came back killed our rabbits [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7810.5s)]
*  We had two Flemish giant rabbits. They're they're their child now [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7817.1s)]
*  You know now I'm thinking about getting a paintball gun and putting some mace in it or something [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7820.82s)]
*  I'm not I don't want to kill the thing. You're not allowed to kill him. That's part of the problem [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7825.66s)]
*  And I wouldn't you have to get a debt I would yeah [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7829.42s)]
*  You'd have to get a depredation permit a tag. Yeah [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7832.34s)]
*  Yeah, sure [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7835.1s)]
*  And I mean, I'm sure if I called fish and game or maybe they're gonna hear this it's gonna become a thing [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7835.5s)]
*  But they're never gonna stop the thing about bears is once they know yeah [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7839.14s)]
*  Once they know and you can't stop you cannot stop them. That's any other animal [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7842.78s)]
*  I've ever encountered or worked with you can mitigate like [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7847.9400000000005s)]
*  Almost very easily put up a fence. No problem, right? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7852.06s)]
*  They're gonna keep coming this this girl and her cub [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7855.1s)]
*  Have you ever seen the video of these giant bears brawling in far Rockaway, New Jersey? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7859.26s)]
*  No, you need to see this because it's crazy. It's a very residential neighborhood, and they're just just [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7864.42s)]
*  No normal suburbs. Huh, we're like, you know kids are waiting for the school bus [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7871.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and we're talking like 300 pound plus black bear just going at it. Look at this [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7875.700000000001s)]
*  They're on the guy's porch practically, yeah, holy crap, so they're fighting over garbage [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7881.58s)]
*  Like who gets access to the garbage look at the size of these fuck. Yeah, these are big bears. I [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7887.379999999999s)]
*  Mean this is the kind of bear like both of these bears the kind of bear that you would want to hunt now the governor [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7895.9s)]
*  Of New Jersey the most recent governor he ran on a platform of stopping the bear hunt [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7901.58s)]
*  Because all the dorky liberals that live in like the you know in the nice cities they don't have any idea [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7906.86s)]
*  What the majority of the voters don't understand or connect exactly? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7913.5s)]
*  Yeah, which is the same in a lot of places where these urban areas vote on things that happen in? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7917.3s)]
*  Partial areas. Yeah in rural areas where they have no idea what the problem is. Yeah, so the amount of human bear [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7923.42s)]
*  Interactions went up so much by over 200% that they had to reinstate the bear [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7930.98s)]
*  Hunt within two years of him being the governor really yeah, so like right away [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7935.9800000000005s)]
*  So it's would he get it in 2020 and then by 2022 he's like, okay enough and has it made an impact [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7940.66s)]
*  Has it helped? Yeah, well, they're gonna start hunting them again now [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7947.02s)]
*  And they're actually gonna raise the number of bears you're allowed to kill god raise the number of tags just to level it out [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7950.24s)]
*  They have to but there's so many of them. That's the thing people don't understand is like we're at a state [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7955.74s)]
*  Where we have to manage the wildlife we don't have a choice this idea that like let's just let it all roam free and everything [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7961.9400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't work that way anymore. There's too much human development [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7968.34s)]
*  There's too many urban areas and we have made an imbalance if everything was wild and natural sure [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7971.52s)]
*  I completely agree leave it alone, but it's not this is not natural. These bears have bred in a residential area [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7977.26s)]
*  They're feeding on garbage. It's totally natural for them be fighting on stairs [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7983.28s)]
*  Totally [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7987.58s)]
*  natural [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7989.1s)]
*  Battling habitat. Yeah, and I'm not saying get rid of the bears. Don't wipe out bears [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7990.46s)]
*  No one's saying that but they have it has to be managed [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7995.14s)]
*  I mean you also have to make them fearful of humans if I don't like I mean the thing about what you're doing trying to [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=7998.18s)]
*  Scare that bear off [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8004.200000000001s)]
*  It's not gonna work. No, I agree with you when they've catch bears going into people's garbage. They have to relocate the bears [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8005.58s)]
*  Yeah, call them naughty bears [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8011.3s)]
*  Yeah [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8012.34s)]
*  They relocate them because if you don't relocate them, they're gonna they know where the garbage is [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8014.34s)]
*  Why would they go hunt a deer when they could just go into your garbage, right? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8018.42s)]
*  You pull out that subway sandwich that you didn't finish [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8021.62s)]
*  Well, my ultimate solution is we have five chickens left and if those five chickens go we're done with chickens for a little bit [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8024.14s)]
*  That's not a good solution [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8030.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, you live in a state where [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8033.38s)]
*  There's no way you can get a permit to shoot that thing [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8037.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, you know, especially if you live in only one acre [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8039.88s)]
*  Yeah [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8043.240000000001s)]
*  One acre is not good even with a bow and arrow because you get a pass through and it's somebody's fucking total matter of fact [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8043.740000000001s)]
*  My friend Bruce said that one of his neighbors [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8050.04s)]
*  Someone shot a crossbow through a deer and it went through their window and stuck into their wall. Holy shit [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8053.16s)]
*  Yeah, one of his neighbors walls got penetrated by a crossbow bolt, but that whoever did that's a fucking asshole [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8059.38s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not legal either [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8066.76s)]
*  I'm sure some jackass. I'm sure who wanted to shoot a deer maybe for food [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8068.68s)]
*  I'm poaching the deer with a crossbow and yeah, yeah probably yeah that does happen [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8072.92s)]
*  I mean it does happen especially, you know with in poor neighborhoods [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8077.96s)]
*  Yeah, like you could get so much meat off of a deer, you know, yeah for weeks and weeks [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8081.84s)]
*  Did you last time I saw you at your LA studio? You gave me like 40 pounds of elk [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8086.400000000001s)]
*  I think I had my last piece like three months ago. Like I savored that I kept it. I told it out [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8090.72s)]
*  I'd only have it on special occasions. It was so good [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8095.72s)]
*  Yeah, I eat so much of that. I know you do. Yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah, my pleasure. Oh good [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8098.16s)]
*  It's so good for you, too. It's so nutrient dense. Yeah, it's like it's like no other meat [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8102.36s)]
*  It really is tastes different feels. It's like look it looks different. It's like more firm when you push on it [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8107.24s)]
*  It's like and you do the liver the heart and everything. Yeah, I eat everything. Yeah, everything [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8113.46s)]

*  But my god the way he eats it it's crazy goes nuts for it [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8125.18s)]
*  Yeah frenzied like a little crackhead [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8129.06s)]
*  Can't help himself. I do that with we get tuna in California, you know, I think I've shown you some pictures and [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8132.22s)]

*  That's quite delicious to be honest, but then I'll just boil it for the dog [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8143.1s)]
*  The house stinks when you're boiling it you have to cook it outside whatever but then you give this this dog [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8145.9800000000005s)]

*  Human beings at one point in time favored animal organs, right? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8194.3s)]
*  But it was the primary thing that we like to eat. Yeah, you know like I had [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8197.52s)]

*  And he spent time with all these different tribal people where they were [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8221.36s)]
*  They killed a goat and they're scooping up the blood the coagulated blood and drinking it [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8225.36s)]
*  So he's eating it there with them is like, oh, yeah, that's gnarly and they also take raw liver and squirt bile on it [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8230.08s)]
*  Oh [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8237.44s)]
*  That's gnarly and they enjoy it that's what they like [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8239.44s)]
*  They like to dip it in bile and blood and a mixture of the two. I get eating liver [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8243.28s)]
*  I've had the blood mixed with milk that the mass I drink they like put a plug in the neck. I've had that and [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8248.800000000001s)]
*  It's palatable. I've accidentally cut the bile open on a fish once or twice and just oh [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8254.720000000001s)]
*  Dude, I mean maybe mammal bile is better, but I highly doubt it [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8262.08s)]
*  Yeah, I bet for whatever reason these people have developed a taste for it, which is really fascinating [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8265.04s)]
*  But it probably goes back to what we were saying earlier [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8269.52s)]
*  Which is it's have they developed a taste for it or do they just know that it's that good for them? [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8271.2s)]
*  So their brain is telling them because of the options available eat it right? This is going to benefit you. Yeah, there's no options [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8276.320000000002s)]
*  It's just survival, right? Yeah [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8283.84s)]
*  Yeah, but liver was always a big thing with the food and the liver was always a big thing with the food [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8285.84s)]
*  Survival right? Yeah, yeah, but liver was always a big thing with the Comanche [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8290.88s)]
*  The Comanche would take liver raw liver and they would squirt bile on it. Oh, I didn't realize that as well [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8295.76s)]
*  It's crazy. Like it's it's a very common thing to eat it that way [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8301.84s)]
*  It's become trendy again, too [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8307.32s)]
*  And maybe it's just the pages that I follow or whatever [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8309.16s)]
*  But I'm seeing way more of the eat animal organs that consume every part of it now than I ever did even a year ago [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8311.539999999999s)]
*  I think that started off with Paul Paul Saladino and then it moved its way to the liver King sure and [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8317.64s)]
*  Unfortunately, and like, you know [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8324.039999999999s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people that were duped into thinking they could actually look like that guy if they were eating raw liver and [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8325.64s)]
*  Raw testicles, but the message of eat those things is a good message. Yes. Yeah eat those things. Yeah organs [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8330.84s)]
*  That's really good for you. But yeah [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8337.72s)]
*  But the idea that that's gonna turn you into but I did read something about [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8340.039999999999s)]
*  Oh actually was informed by a friend that eating testicles [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8344.68s)]
*  That it is possible that eating testicles has an androgenic effect [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8349.480000000001s)]
*  Oh and then and you can actually get some oral form of testosterone from eating testicles. See if you can Google that [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8353.960000000001s)]
*  Because they've tested some testicle supplements and [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8363.04s)]
*  through testing these testicle supplements they found trace amounts of [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8369.2s)]
*  What would show up in a drug test as taking oral testosterone? No kidding [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8374.2s)]
*  Yeah, also just saying testing testicle supplements three times fast is I was like waiting for you to fumble. It was testing testicle supplements [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8380.320000000002s)]
*  That's that's cool. I mean it you're eating testosterone. Yeah, right [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8388.68s)]
*  So it's just there is something there. You're not just digesting it [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8392.68s)]
*  I guess you're actually absorbing right and well Rocky Mountain oysters was always like a big thing that Cowboys would eat whenever they would [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8397.18s)]
*  Castrate bowls. Yep. Yep. Turn them into steers. Good. Have you had it? I have it's good [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8403.519999999999s)]
*  It's not bad. I mean everything deep-fried tastes good. Yeah, it's not the best thing in the world, right, you know, there's definitely [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8408.039999999999s)]
*  Rather have a rib eye. Yeah, any better. Yeah, but it but it's edible. You're not like forcing it down. You're like, this is not bad [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8414.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's not nasty. Right. It's just like it's not bad. Yeah. Yeah, but it's um [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8422.32s)]
*  You see anything about that? [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8427.759999999998s)]
*  If people looked at this [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8430.76s)]
*  Google [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8433.24s)]
*  This is like explanation about it. Oh, no, I understand. I was gonna say tell you Google [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8434.44s)]
*  the whole package [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8440.2s)]
*  Google testosterone found in the whole package [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8443.32s)]
*  Desiccated [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8450.48s)]
*  test testicles supplements because I think the whole package is one of those [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8451.84s)]
*  Liver King supplements [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8457.68s)]
*  Him and Paul Saladino [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8460.76s)]
*  Both were partners in one of these companies whether it's ancestral supplements or the other one where they sell [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8463.16s)]
*  desiccated or [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8471.0s)]
*  Dehydrated liver and heart and kidneys and I've taken their supplements. They're really excellent [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8472.84s)]
*  But I think one of them I think it's called the whole package has been shown to [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8478.560000000001s)]
*  To [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8484.36s)]
*  Contain some oral form of testosterone. Is it the whole beast? [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8485.92s)]
*  Because I've seen that being [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8489.92s)]
*  You're right. Yeah, okay [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8492.6s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean the actual testing of it not from them from someone else [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8496.4s)]
*  But I think that's great that people are choosing to eat these things not just for their health [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8502.52s)]
*  But the fact that there's much less animal waste it's not all just going to dog food and things like that [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8507.0s)]
*  It's like people are starting it's trendy. It's cool Paul liver King whomever they're turning this into a thing [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8512.52s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie, I actually I he actually sent it to me. Hold on a second. I can send it to you. I now I'm remembering [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8518.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is I mean it is good in that regard yeah [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8527.119999999999s)]
*  Give me one second here it is [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8531.439999999999s)]
*  Why is your airdrop on there it goes, all right [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8538.88s)]
*  Okay [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8546.24s)]
*  Are you receiving that? [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8548.48s)]
*  Okay [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8550.32s)]
*  So pull that up. So this is someone actually tested it and [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8552.0s)]
*  This is what the results were that they had found and this is from the whole package so and justine [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8556.52s)]
*  317 di on 20 nanograms per gram. I don't know what any dirty damn grass [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8565.0s)]
*  testosterone 250 nanograms to program [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8571.68s)]
*  Three to three hundred nanograms per gram. So what it is is showing [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8575.52s)]
*  That there's some kind of androgens that are available [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8579.96s)]
*  That are that people have detected in this supplement now is that orally active? That's the question [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8584.6s)]
*  Like does it actually increase your testosterone by eating it? I have no idea. Yeah, I'm not the guy for that [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8590.8s)]
*  But eating organs just the sheer [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8597.04s)]
*  Nutrient content of like liver. Yeah, per se [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8601.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people who like my friend Derek eats one ounce of liver every day [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8603.52s)]
*  No, he cooks it okay, but he does it just for sheer just for health benefits [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8609.6s)]
*  Yeah, and he feels a genuine change from eating it. Yeah, it's just it's undeniable that it's like a nutrient dense food [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8614.24s)]
*  So it's really a superfood. It's I mean, I know it's been said, you know on social media and stuff [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8621.24s)]
*  But it's a lot of animals pick the liver if they have their choice a lot of predators pick out livers [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8627.24s)]
*  You know orcas lions hyenas all kinds of things wolves if they have the choice [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8632.52s)]
*  They are eating the liver immediately. Yeah, it's fascinating. Yeah. Well that tells you something right there really does [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8637.4s)]
*  It tells you that there is so much vital nutrient in that organ that it's being selected for over muscle meat over other tissue [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8642.359999999999s)]
*  You know and you get different stuff from different parts of the animal skin has different stuff, you know [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8649.88s)]
*  But the fact that that's being selected for first. I mean that should be an indicator [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8653.76s)]
*  I think we can live our lives by things animals show us. Yeah. Well, you definitely can learn something from them [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8658.06s)]
*  You've done a lot of us [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8663.64s)]
*  Diving and you know, you do a lot of fishing [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8665.8s)]
*  Are you concerned at all about mercury levels in fish and yeah. Yeah, I think that you know [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8668.56s)]
*  If I had a diet of exclusively bluefin tuna, I'm certain I'd get you know mercury poisoning foggy headed [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8674.84s)]
*  You know all the things that come from that but as long as you're varying it, you know [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8681.279999999999s)]
*  And you're not like I think being pescatarian with wild apex fish like there's certain choices, right? [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8685.539999999999s)]
*  Certain fish have much lower mercury levels than others and it's the apex ones the ones that are the predators [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8691.78s)]
*  They're the ones who get the higher fish content or the higher mercury content because they're eating [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8697.62s)]
*  All these other fish that spend a lot of time in the depths of the ocean where the heavy metal poisoning is [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8702.02s)]
*  Is that the idea that's part of it? It's it's really just the bioaccumulation [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8708.820000000002s)]
*  So every fish has the same amount this is very vague, but every fish has the same amount of mercury [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8712.62s)]
*  But if you're a fish at the top of the food chain and you eat a thousand small fish [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8718.7s)]
*  That's all that mercury is accumulating because it doesn't dissipate versus if you're a fish lower down in the food chain like a sardine [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8722.62s)]
*  That's just eating microorganisms and algae. It's not accumulating a lot of mercury. It's interesting you say that because I tested positive for [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8729.7s)]
*  Arsenic from sardines really? Yeah, how does that happen? [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8738.18s)]
*  I got a blood test and my doctor was like you got arsenic in your blood. I was like that's terrible [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8741.42s)]
*  Yeah, and and he goes he goes not a lot because it's very small amount [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8746.92s)]
*  He goes, but what are you eating and he goes are you eating any sardines? I go. Yeah, I eat a lot [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8751.84s)]
*  I eat like three cans a day [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8756.32s)]
*  I was eating a lot of sardines. That's a lot young and single and stupid. Yeah, and he said don't do that [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8758.44s)]
*  He said let's do it again in a couple of months. Just cut that out of your diet cut it out of my diet went back [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8764.36s)]
*  Nothing. What do you know how the arsenic is in sardines? I don't have any metal toxins [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8769.52s)]
*  They spend a lot of time in the low depths of the ocean where a lot of that stuff accumulates [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8774.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and all the radiation is more. Yeah, that's so there was a lot of you know [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8779.68s)]
*  Concern about like our Eastern bluefin tuna population, right? [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8785.44s)]
*  Which are there's a population of bluefin tuna that basically just swim between Central America [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8789.28s)]
*  us in California, Northern America and over to Japan and back they just do this big circle every year and [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8793.560000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of concern that when they're going over to Japan from Hiroshima and things like that [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8799.12s)]
*  They're picking up a lot of radiation and that's actually activating the mercury, right? Oh [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8803.92s)]
*  So there's been published studies on this and I don't know exactly how much it's affected in those fish [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8809.76s)]
*  But the fish going over there undeniably have higher higher amounts of mercury than the fish over on the west coast of the United States [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8815.0s)]
*  The radiation activates the mercury. Yeah, there's been some I don't understand how I don't understand how it's connected [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8823.4s)]
*  Yeah, how much time is there left in the ocean for these fish if you think about how quickly [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8829.92s)]
*  We want to talk about how we wiped out woolly mammoths and we wiped out the bison. We are wiping out fish at a fucking [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8837.640000000001s)]
*  Staggering rate an alarming rate. Yeah [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8845.44s)]
*  Yeah [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8847.44s)]
*  And what's crazy before we talk about how much time is left? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8847.720000000001s)]
*  Scientists predict that eight years is all it would take to bring it back to a hundred percent or maybe was 98 percent [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8851.04s)]
*  What if we stopped fishing the ocean for eight years it would be back to nearly a hundred percent for currency a hundred percent perfect [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8856.119999999999s)]
*  Nearly but we'd have to get all the countries on board [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8864.08s)]
*  Yeah [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8866.939999999999s)]
*  That means for eight years all the fishermen would starve and not to mention fishes the primary source of protein for like the majority of [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8867.32s)]
*  The planet is it really it is. Yeah, the majority of the plan. Yeah, that's certainly everywhere coastal [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8873.92s)]
*  But the majority of the planet's majority of protein comes from fish Wow [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8878.96s)]
*  Yeah, which is why and we are I mean we are wiping out, you know, it's a hundred million sharks a year [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8883.36s)]
*  We're killing just sharks a hundred million a year. Just think about that. That is so many animals [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8888.28s)]
*  Yeah, so, I mean are the oceans fucked my short answer is no because I don't like to think in that doom and gloom [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8895.2s)]
*  I think that we have the ability and the knowledge to overcome it. We just have to figure out how we're gonna do that [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8902.6s)]
*  I think if we continue at the rate that we're doing it [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8908.44s)]
*  We're gonna see a big collapse and and by the way people seem to forget about this if we lose the ocean we all die [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8911.4s)]
*  It's the biggest carbon neutralizer. It gives us all of our protein. Like there's a million reasons why the ocean [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8917.52s)]
*  It's where all our rain comes from everything is connected to the ocean. And if we fuck that up completely we're gone [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8922.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and yet here we are like day after day doing everything we can just dumping stuff into the ocean [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8930.0s)]
*  Everything yeah giant nets and scooping up every fucking living thing that gets caught in it [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8936.56s)]
*  Everything those trawlers that are like scraping the bottom all the starfish and skates and Carl Reeves. It's crazy that we know [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8942.439999999999s)]
*  I love sushi. It's the best favorite food in the whole world. I know [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8949.519999999999s)]
*  We're all hypocrites in that regard. So fuck there's just so many goddamn people and so much need. Yep [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8954.08s)]
*  Yeah [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8960.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if people were forced to gather their own food and hunt for their own food and you know [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8960.56s)]
*  you had like a few months out of the year that all you did was hunting fish and then you stored it all and [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8966.92s)]
*  Stockpiled it and you know, we would have a completely different [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8972.08s)]
*  Thought about like where food comes from hundred percent [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8976.359999999999s)]
*  But the fact you could just pull in a jack-in-the-box get a burger right or you know, he's a cow. No problem [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8979.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's the connectedness man. I stand by that [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8984.519999999999s)]
*  I think I've become more and more of a proponent for it as I get older [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8987.92s)]
*  But it's just like people need to connect with nature and connect with animals if they can do that they can have appreciation [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8990.88s)]
*  They're more willing to make smart choice. I'm not saying don't eat sushi. I fucking love sushi [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=8997.48s)]
*  It's my favorite food in the whole world [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9001.56s)]
*  But I still try and make smart choices like I try not to get five orders of bluefin tuna for the obvious reason that that's [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9003.2s)]
*  Typically bluefin tuna that's getting wiped out right like but it's cuz I'm connected cuz I go diving and I love the ocean [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9009.44s)]
*  And I see those fish and so I just think people need to connect to nature more. Yeah, we're very disconnected [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9015.88s)]
*  It's just such a new thing to that human beings live in these massive population centers [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9022.259999999998s)]
*  right Los Angeles and New York and are so [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9027.48s)]
*  Removed from the process of like where their food comes from completely and utterly to the point that humans are disgusted by it [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9031.039999999999s)]
*  Like you see these comments online or like oh my god [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9037.88s)]
*  How can you cut that fish up or how can you fillet that? [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9040.539999999999s)]
*  That deer or clean that elk or whatever it's like where the fuck do you think your food's coming from? [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9043.68s)]
*  Yeah, and they were disgusted by the process and yet those are the same people that are going and eating it [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9048.24s)]
*  No, and they're the same people if they're not eating fish and meat [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9053.039999999999s)]
*  They don't understand what monocrop agriculture is doing to the earth and that's ten times worth. It's the worst. It's dude [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9056.4s)]
*  We went to Borneo. I've never been so heartbroken in my entire life looking at an environment [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9063.26s)]
*  We went to Borneo to look for this this primate species Miller's grizzled langur and from the moment [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9068.36s)]
*  You just mumbled that sorry the Miller's grizzled langur called the Dracula monkey. It's a monkey with this big collar [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9073.52s)]
*  We found it first one seen in 30 years. We got on trail camera. What does that look like? [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9079.36s)]
*  It's it's awesome. Jamie can pull it up. You know what a Langer is found one [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9083.480000000001s)]
*  So yeah, they were thought to be extinct. Yeah for 30 years. Yeah Wow [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9087.220000000001s)]
*  coma Dracula monkey. Yeah, whoa [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9091.76s)]
*  What a cool-looking the picture to the left is our is our picture that one right there. Yeah, that's my picture [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9094.52s)]
*  I think yeah, I think that's our picture rare monkey. Yeah discovered in Borneo. Yep [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9100.4s)]
*  So they hadn't been seen for like 30 years and there's this incredible professor [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9105.08s)]
*  I worked with and she she pointed me in the right direction then we worked with the right people [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9108.84s)]
*  there's me right there in the Dracula monkey and [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9113.2s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, so we went and found this guy but the point being we landed in Borneo [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9116.6s)]
*  We drove for two days to get to this this primary piece of jungle for two days [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9121.0s)]
*  All we saw was oil palm for two days. I'm not joking. It's just like eight nine hours of driving per day [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9126.24s)]
*  Plantation after plantation of monoculture one singular crop wiping out [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9133.880000000001s)]
*  Virgin primary jungle to plant this oil palm. It was [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9140.0s)]
*  Devastating nothing lives in it and palm oil is used for [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9144.4s)]
*  Everything every your Nutella your peanut butter your it's like the cheapest version of oil [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9149.16s)]
*  And so it's in tons, especially sweet food products. It's in it's in everything [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9155.88s)]
*  And again, I love Nutella, but I try not to buy it because I've been I've been to Borneo [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9160.8s)]
*  I've seen I'm not saying everybody can do that [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9165.119999999999s)]
*  But at least I've been connected to it enough to now try and make those decisions, you know [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9166.8s)]
*  And it's just man that monoculture and seeing it and and then you get into this tiny little patch of virgin jungle, right? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9171.18s)]
*  that's like whatever a couple hundred miles or whatever tiny compared to the island and [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9177.64s)]
*  It's so alive and virgin. Yeah, this is what it looks like just for four days Joe. I'm not kidding [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9182.32s)]
*  It is devastating to see and so all that [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9188.599999999999s)]
*  Wildlife all that habitat is all destroyed for this monocrop. Yep all gone. Yes. Look at that picture 1950 versus 2020 [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9193.039999999999s)]
*  Look at that 1950. Look at the amount of virgin jungle 2020. Look what's left Wow [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9200.92s)]
*  It's [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9207.64s)]
*  Literally like there's maybe 30% left [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9208.76s)]
*  And so we drove up that sort of coastline that you see there and it's just you just see nothing. Yeah, exactly [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9211.08s)]
*  Thanks, Jamie, and you just it's it's [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9216.359999999999s)]
*  Unfathomable that we can do this and it's because it's cheap. It's because labor in Indonesia is cheap [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9219.84s)]
*  It's cheap to produce the crop [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9224.16s)]
*  Everything's getting torn up like that looking like those mines and that's just for plantation and it's and nothing you go into it at night [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9226.279999999999s)]
*  Right like with a headlamp or whatever silent just sign no crickets. No bats. No birds silent [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9233.84s)]
*  You get into these little patches of jungle [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9240.28s)]
*  Noises and crickets and bugs and bees and other night in the jungle is just definite. It's amazing [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9243.52s)]
*  It's deafening, but I don't care who you are. You will sleep well listening to it because it's natural [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9250.6s)]
*  It's like the kind of thing you pay for to play, you know [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9256.12s)]
*  Sleep sounds and it's like loud and crazy [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9259.48s)]
*  But like you lay down and you listen to it and you just drift off right to sleep [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9262.279999999999s)]
*  Whereas if I'm if I'm in New York, you know and like, you know high-rise staying there [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9266.4s)]
*  I can't sleep at all listening to the ambulances and you know, it's crazy. Yeah. No, I can't either [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9270.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't like hearing that shit. Well for us still alive. It's your book. It's available now [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9276.359999999999s)]
*  Did you do the audio version of it? I did did you narrate it? I did. Yeah. Yeah [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9281.859999999999s)]
*  My scratchy voice if you want happy I love when an author reads their own book [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9285.880000000001s)]
*  It's really depressing when they hire some actor to read it when you know, they're disconnected from the subject matter [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9290.92s)]
*  You especially you help me write that I don't even know that how did I help you when we went to see the wolves together? [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9295.560000000001s)]
*  We're sitting in the car and you're like dude [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9300.880000000001s)]
*  Get out from under the thumb of these networks do your own thing do more of it because I was griping about how tough it [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9303.12s)]
*  Is to get you know, the animal plant discovery whatever on board for some of these projects and you're like just go fucking do it [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9308.28s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, alright and that was like I think we hung out in January and kovat hit in March [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9313.12s)]
*  Yes, and yeah kovat hit and I was like, well, I'm stuck at home. I'm gonna write a book. Well, I'm glad you did Ben [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9318.039999999999s)]
*  I'm glad you're [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9323.72s)]
*  Thinking along those ways because I think if you did a show and just did it on YouTube or did it on some other platform [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9325.4s)]
*  yeah, I mean you probably have way more views even than you're getting off of the networks because [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9331.24s)]
*  People just aren't watching TV. They're not used to people are really fascinated by the internet [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9336.16s)]
*  They're watching things in their phones [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9341.68s)]
*  They're watching Apple TV and Netflix and and that's where people are getting their something getting it from the internet [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9343.6s)]
*  You're right. And that's where I'm going. We've started this thing called the wild times, which is our YouTube thing and it's super fun [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9350.0s)]
*  It's very like talk show, you know [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9354.880000000001s)]
*  But we talk about wildlife news and what's happening in the world and started to do some content for it. Beautiful [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9356.68s)]
*  It's fun, man, and I'm still doing shows [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9361.720000000001s)]
*  It's on YouTube and Spotify and all those places called the wild times. Is it your YouTube channel? What is the channel itself? [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9363.92s)]
*  There it is right there. Okay wild times pod on YouTube [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XDniI08WY&t=9370.32s)]
