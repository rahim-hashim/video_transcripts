# Joe Rogan Experience #1405 - Sober October 3 Recap
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 24, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4gdLhOp3OE)
*  You'll be fine. One cigar, I'll fuck him down for a week. Shut up. You'll be fine.
*  Oh, in these next few years? Boom. And we're live. Okay. So, the last few weeks, we've been getting these annoying text messages from Ari, where everything's in Spanish.
*  Everything. Everything. Don't look. I'm like, what is this? How long is this joke gonna go? En escuela.
*  And then he gets here, with a backpack on, like, where you been? I was in Medellin. Medellin.
*  He was, he was doing, you were doing a Spanish immersion thing? Yeah, 100% Spanish. I brought back these Cuban cigars.
*  Wow. Yeah. So, did you have any Spanish speaking lessons before you went to Colombia? Cero.
*  It sounds like zero. It does sound like zero. It's a pretty close language. A lot of it's pretty close.
*  So, zero? No, I had nothing. Cero is zero?
*  All right. You also understand a little bit. Tom, you're doing a podcast in Spanish. Yeah, yeah.
*  This is his Me Too back party. Like, when Tom gets Me Too'd in America, he's gonna go run, do a show in Latin America.
*  This is his insurance policy. I'm setting up the escape plan right now, man.
*  Other countries are like, what's the problem? The Latin countries would have, no problem.
*  I've had this conversation multiple times. That's about it.
*  How Latin people are like, me what? No, no, no. They don't.
*  We were talking to his cousin who lives in Peru. He called his cousin, and there's a term Latinx,
*  which is not Latino or Latina. It's, you know, it's a gender neutral way of saying Latin. Yeah.
*  And he says to his cousin in Spanish, you know, uh, to say Latinx. And he's like, oh, uh, maricon?
*  He goes, he's like, I try to, he goes, what? I'm like, you know, it's a gender neutral.
*  So you're saying he was like a faggot. I feel like, come on.
*  That's not exactly what I'm saying. My teacher, we were talking about like
*  parents, something like that. And there was like the word for, for parents is just like,
*  fathers pretty much. So then it's like, what if you have two mothers? Do you, do you call it madres
*  as parents instead of like, you know, if it's just father, it's padre. If it's just mother,
*  it's madre. But if it's parents, it's padre. So I'm like, do it's just like, okay. And like,
*  she was like, no, still padre. And then, you know, that's okay these days. It's okay.
*  It was her thing as forward as she could be. Like that's fine though.
*  What country do you think is most in the dark ages with wokeness?
*  Russia. Oh yeah. Yeah. Russia, they make laws about gay people.
*  They did for the Olympics. Iran has, according to their leader, 0% homosexual population.
*  Yeah. Iran's worse than Russia because Russia has people that are outside of the control of
*  the government that are just freely speaking, that are talking about homosexual problems and
*  like pussy riot. Remember when pussy riot was getting in? Yeah.
*  They're fucking hot. You like that?
*  Yeah. I got to think about that. I think like the
*  arrested chicks right out of jail. Russia don't fuck around dude.
*  No. They don't fuck around. They don't fuck around.
*  At all. You know, like you're, there's a kind of a, I don't know, selling like a
*  point from them that it's, they're trying to be progressive thinkers. Like some of them will
*  disguise it as that, but they're definitely, they're not fucking around.
*  Someone from Russia, some government agency made a tweet about freedom of the press.
*  What'd they say? About respecting the press and
*  appreciating the press. And someone, some journalists said, this is a country that has
*  literally, like this administration has literally been responsible for murders of dozens of people
*  that are journalists. Yeah.
*  Like when people would report on them or people would running against certain members of the
*  government, they would just whack them. Sure.
*  Like in broad daylight. And even more disappearances,
*  which is slang for murders. Yeah.
*  You know, like that person's just gone. We haven't seen.
*  We just don't want to explain it. So I don't know.
*  I can't wait to go back and see how much it's changed. Like the-
*  Are you going back? Yeah. I'm doing a tour there.
*  Oh, Jesus. They're going to kidnap you for sure.
*  My kids are like, we want to go too. I was like, fuck that.
*  But yeah, but I, but to hang out with Russian guys and ask them questions that I asked when
*  I was in college, like I remember asking them about black people and they were like,
*  oh no, no, no, they don't. They can't be here.
*  Roy Jones Jr. is a Russian citizen.
*  No, like a legit Russian citizen.
*  This was 1995. Really?
*  Yes. Roy Jones Jr. has been going over to Russia for a long time.
*  He's a giant star over there. They love him. They love him.
*  Are you fucking serious? Oh.
*  Totally serious. I'm thinking of Roy Woods.
*  Roy Woods. What is that comic?
*  Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck? He's a fucking-
*  Oh, how hilarious.
*  Look at it. Look at it. Roy Jones Jr. with Putin.
*  He looks like Putin's shaking his hand too hard. He's trying to get it away.
*  Maybe. Perhaps. I don't think so. But he's over there all the time.
*  He's got a fucking Russian passport.
*  No shit. I'd like that. I'd like that.
*  Listen, dude, they threw that AAA poonana at him.
*  Yeah.
*  AAA Russian poonana.
*  That's that smile.
*  Look at him smiling. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He knows he's got it.
*  He's fought over there a bunch of times too. He fought over there fairly recently.
*  How long are you going to be there for, Brad?
*  I don't know. Just like probably two weeks, maybe. I don't know.
*  I haven't- It's- Yeah.
*  You're going to do shows?
*  Yeah. I'm excited. I'm going to bring a film crew.
*  Shultz did a bunch of shows there.
*  Who did?
*  Andrew Shultz.
*  Did he? In Russia?
*  Yeah. He put some of it online. It was hilarious.
*  I bet Gaffigan has too. He's done shows fucking-
*  Everywhere.
*  Everywhere.
*  Has he?
*  Nobody plays more plays than Jim Gaffigan.
*  Yeah. He just announced he's doing a Latin American tour.
*  In English.
*  Holy shit.
*  In English. Yeah.
*  Of course.
*  He goes everywhere. Everywhere.
*  Wow.
*  Dude, what's the guy that ran 25 marathons in 25 days?
*  Eddie Izzard?
*  Eddie Izzard did shows in German and doesn't speak German.
*  He did that in French too.
*  He just memorized the language. He just memorized how the words would go.
*  Whoa.
*  Is that not- I've been trying to tell the machine in Spanish,
*  and I know Spanish, but it's fucking still hard as fuck.
*  Eddie Izzard is a savage. Do you want to know what it takes to run
*  26 marathons in a row when you don't even run?
*  Day after day?
*  Day after day. There's videos of it where they show his feet,
*  where he takes his socks off. Literally, the skin is falling off the meat.
*  His skin is raw and open. They're taping it up and bandaging shit.
*  He can't even stand.
*  And he's running.
*  And he's running 26 miles every fucking day.
*  That's a different mindset.
*  Will. He's a really interesting guy.
*  I had him in on the podcast. He's in full woman's regalia,
*  but he says, but I fancy the ladies. He fancies girls.
*  He just likes dressing like a woman, but he's a man.
*  Yeah. And he's transgender.
*  And he stopped for a while too. He dressed like that.
*  Then he stopped dressing like that.
*  He does whatever the fuck he wants, man.
*  I love that guy. I really like him too. I really like talking to him.
*  He's interesting.
*  He's a brilliant dude.
*  A really smart dude.
*  Yeah. But also the kind of will that you have to have.
*  Yeah. That's what stands out.
*  Why would he do that?
*  He's an animal.
*  But he did, and he also was in a charity, right?
*  Yeah. He did that and he did one in South Africa.
*  It was an area where he was good. He wanted to run.
*  They were like, listen to me.
*  If you run through there, they're going to kill you.
*  You can't run through there.
*  We're going to pick you up in a car.
*  We're going to take you past that.
*  And then we're going to follow you in cars.
*  We can't even be with you in a car while you're running,
*  or they'll kill you.
*  What? In South Africa?
*  Bro, this part of South Africa, they're rough.
*  You think? I've been to those.
*  Apparently, carjacking down there is just out of fucking control.
*  We were in South Africa.
*  We spent the night in a shanty town.
*  I went in and I brought soccer balls.
*  I brought like 40 soccer balls for all the kids, right?
*  Because we were going to play soccer with them.
*  So I bought a big truck full of soccer balls.
*  This is on Travel Channel.
*  I roll in with like 40 fucking soccer balls
*  and their coach loses his fucking mind.
*  Just shy of hitting me through a machete.
*  He's like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  You're going to give every kid in here a soccer ball?
*  He was going to all get fucking murdered on the way home
*  because someone killed their soccer ball.
*  I was like, sorry.
*  He was like, take the fuck out of here.
*  So then we spent the night, right?
*  Murdered for a soccer ball.
*  Dude, it's a shanty town.
*  Soccer balls got value there.
*  Especially think of all the, I mean, we spent the night.
*  I could be partying that night.
*  It was like one of these little things.
*  Wait a minute, this story just got weird.
*  Who are you partying with the kids?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  We stay in a shanty town.
*  It was fucking crazy.
*  It was like out of belly.
*  Everyone's sweaty.
*  Everyone's dark, dark, dark.
*  Oh, it's fucking badass.
*  Did you get malaria?
*  No, I was on those pills.
*  I was dreaming crazy.
*  We woke up the next day, right?
*  I'm outside having coffee in my little shanty thing.
*  Guy comes sprinting down the street and a mob is chasing him.
*  And I'm like, what the fuck?
*  And our handler's like, oh yeah.
*  And I go, what?
*  And he goes, I heard about that.
*  He stole a pillow.
*  And I was like, you stole a pillow?
*  And then I get, he stole a pillow.
*  Don't worry, they'll get him.
*  They're going to necklace him.
*  I go, what?
*  And he goes, that's justice here.
*  They put a tire around his neck and light him on fire.
*  I go, for a fucking pillow?
*  I was like, all right, wrap it.
*  We're done.
*  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
*  I'm not spending another second here.
*  Why would you risk that for a pillow?
*  Have you read like a great pillow though?
*  Like when they're like an air memory.
*  I've owned one.
*  Yeah, but they don't have too much give.
*  They're not too strong.
*  And you go like, I'm not leaving this pillow.
*  I'll take it back.
*  If someone steals this pillow over me, I'm lighting them all fire.
*  I see both sides now.
*  Yeah.
*  Brazil was sketchy.
*  We went into the favelas in Brazil and got lost at sunset.
*  Why?
*  What are you doing?
*  Travel channel.
*  I just used it.
*  Beautiful way to die.
*  It was we took motorcycles up.
*  We took motorcycles up.
*  And then we gave our, we weren't taking them back down.
*  So we gave guys our motorcycles, our helmets.
*  And they were fucking through the roof.
*  And as soon as we gave them our helmets,
*  you could see their attitude change.
*  And they were like, don't stay up here.
*  And we're like, what?
*  And they're like, don't, no matter what they say,
*  don't stay up here.
*  We're going to spend the night.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Favelas.
*  Favela.
*  Yeah, they have a great, they have a great, there's one.
*  Five star luxury hotel.
*  No, they have a great hotel in a favela that like, man, someone
*  would know if you had done this traveling,
*  you'd remember more on it.
*  Remember a shit about Travel Channel because we're
*  doing so much different shit.
*  And you were drunk.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa, I was hammered in this favela.
*  It was fucking awesome, dude.
*  We went and played.
*  You're just not supposed to go there.
*  No, we went in and we got lost.
*  And we found this soccer game with these kids.
*  And it was like the buildings started.
*  This is with a camera crew?
*  No, we didn't have a camera crew because we got lost.
*  Me and the two travelers got lost.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  He brought guests.
*  Yeah.
*  And we, and they're like, we're going to be fine.
*  We're on TV.
*  They don't know what a fucking favela is.
*  No, we're not.
*  They're from Indiana.
*  We're fine.
*  Everything's fine.
*  They're from Denver.
*  Bert's our friend.
*  I can't believe we're on TV.
*  Yeah.
*  And then the camera crew found us and they filmed us
*  playing soccer with the kids.
*  And then they're like, hey, we got to get the fuck out.
*  And I was like, no, let's go back to the hotel.
*  We went back to the hotel.
*  Best view of Brazil you'll ever get.
*  It's on the mountain, right?
*  It's the best view of Brazil.
*  That's the weird thing about the favelas.
*  It's like the Hollywood Hills.
*  They're above, looking down at this beautiful village.
*  We went with, for real, with the UFC.
*  And they were like, do not go there.
*  Yeah.
*  We might go everywhere, but do not go there.
*  Yeah, do not.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we didn't, and then John Jones was up there
*  the whole weekend.
*  He was?
*  Yeah.
*  He's dancing every single time.
*  Before he was a champ, I think.
*  Oh, no.
*  Just hanging out.
*  No, he was a champ.
*  He was already the champ.
*  Yeah, he was just hanging there.
*  Fuck, man.
*  I guess he thought he could beat him in a one-on-one.
*  Did you stay in a nice place in Medellin?
*  Yeah, with a balcony.
*  Oh, in Medellin?
*  Yeah.
*  No, it's a homestay with a family.
*  Oh, wow.
*  What a lucky family.
*  Wow.
*  A full immersion, huh?
*  Yeah, full immersion.
*  And then Sabrina.
*  So how good is your Spanish now?
*  Is it passable?
*  Can you go somewhere and talk to people?
*  So I could order food.
*  I could ask where the bus is.
*  And I could like-
*  Are you going to continue this education?
*  You're going to take classes?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I want to eventually, next time I take a sabbatical,
*  I want to go through South America for a while.
*  Damn, son.
*  Looking to get killed.
*  Oh, it's safe.
*  Medellin is super safe now.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah.
*  Parts of it are really poor.
*  That's right.
*  Oh, that's my picture.
*  That's right.
*  I was like, oh, right there.
*  That guy was there.
*  It's the same weather.
*  Same weather.
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's your own picture.
*  You're like, what the fuck?
*  It says RE Spir hashtag.
*  I like the second time in his bird is fat.
*  Hashtag baby Jesus.
*  That's what I'm going to do with you.
*  Second time in bird is fat.
*  And dark.
*  That's hilarious, man.
*  That's the one.
*  Madden, 10-4 parts.
*  We went to the cathedral where-
*  I like that there was some reason for you to take-
*  because we were all reading your texts.
*  What the fuck kind of bit is this?
*  Me and Tom were getting annoyed.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  What are you doing?
*  Like, how long is this joke going to go for?
*  I know what this joke is.
*  I don't like it.
*  And it's up in the front.
*  Yeah, it was an immersion.
*  I had to try to speak no English as much as I could.
*  That's interesting, man.
*  It's fun doing that kind of shit.
*  Yeah, it was really cool.
*  That's the way to do it, man.
*  And it was like, I was always off balance.
*  They were speaking about grammatical shit.
*  That's like- and I was like- and first of all,
*  I haven't been in school for 25 years.
*  Yeah.
*  So even just that alone was difficult.
*  Well, tell us about this family that was blessed enough to have you stay with them for a month.
*  Adriana and their Sabrina.
*  Yeah, it was weird.
*  The first day I got there, we just sat there and stared at each other.
*  I had nothing.
*  So why did they let you in?
*  The homestay?
*  Yeah.
*  They make money through the school.
*  The school finds homestays for people that are like-
*  And they just do a background check on you or no?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Joe, Joe, no.
*  Clearly no.
*  No.
*  Clearly no.
*  No.
*  They didn't even fucking Google him, apparently.
*  They're like,
*  Molly?
*  I didn't even have time for drugs.
*  I- when I went to people like, you're gonna find cocaine?
*  I was like, I guess I should, but it was like not in America.
*  I didn't have time for drugs.
*  That's hilarious.
*  You had to go into like the health of other parts.
*  Did you see- did you visit some Escobar shit?
*  Yeah, the cathedral.
*  The cathedral.
*  Big hike that starts where his prison was.
*  And there's an old age home there now, and they have signs up there.
*  And it was like, this has nothing to do with him.
*  You shouldn't be visiting here anyway.
*  He was a garbage man who fucking killed a bunch of people.
*  And he goes, and you're awful tourists.
*  You leave trash everywhere.
*  There's like signs made for that.
*  Whoa.
*  They're right.
*  You've got this culture in your country where you leave trash around.
*  Meanwhile, our-
*  Marcos must have changed everything for them, right?
*  It became glamorous, almost like Tony Montana.
*  Yeah, man.
*  I mean, that guy who played it.
*  What is that guy's name who played-
*  Escobar in Narcos.
*  In Narcos.
*  He's a Brazilian actor.
*  Yeah, they got mad that he wasn't Colombian.
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucking great.
*  He's great.
*  Yeah, he was great.
*  Find you a Colombian guy.
*  Smokey D the whole time.
*  That dude didn't speak Spanish when he took that role.
*  Oh, sorry, Portuguese.
*  He only spoke Portuguese.
*  So close, though.
*  Yeah, but I mean like, you can-
*  Not even close at all!
*  It is close.
*  Not even remotely.
*  No, I have Brazilian friends who can speak a little bit of Paso-
*  Spanish.
*  You can pick up on some things.
*  For real?
*  I feel like Italian is closer to Spanish than Portuguese.
*  Italian is definitely closer than Portuguese.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah, Portuguese is like-
*  Italian is close to Spanish.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I took both in college.
*  I don't think Portuguese is a Latin language.
*  It is.
*  It is a Latin language.
*  For real?
*  Yeah.
*  But it's definitely-
*  Like if someone gets going in Portuguese and speaks Spanish,
*  you definitely don't know the fucking thing.
*  Portuguese is beautiful.
*  They have such a song to it.
*  It's like a sing-
*  I always love listening to Brazilian guys talk.
*  His sound is just-
*  That's what I was about to say.
*  Wow.
*  There's his name.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Wagner Moura.
*  That sounds Portuguese.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, the guy who played-
*  Season one, you hear him speak.
*  You note that he definitely-
*  Has an accent.
*  Oh, a heavy non-Spanish accent.
*  Season two, he definitely got better.
*  You could tell he's been speaking for a while.
*  Did you hear the location scout for Narcos got killed by the cartel?
*  Wasn't that for the third season?
*  Maybe.
*  For the Mexican season?
*  That's right, the Mexican one.
*  Oh, the Mexican one.
*  The Mexicans are not fucking around either.
*  They're not playing-
*  They're like, what, you guys think Russians do shit?
*  Check that out.
*  Check this out.
*  They're doing.
*  Here's a head.
*  We don't even know who she is.
*  What was that a few weeks ago?
*  The Mormons.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  Yeah, well, there's a Mormon-
*  There's a couple of Mormon colonies that left America in the 1800s when they made polygamy illegal,
*  and including, by the way, homeboy from fucking Massachusetts,
*  the guy running for president.
*  What the fuck's his name?
*  I do.
*  It's on the tip of my tongue.
*  Mitt Romney.
*  Mitt Romney.
*  Mitt Romney.
*  I said Tor.
*  Mitt Romney's father was a brilliant guy but could never be president because
*  he was born in Mexico.
*  Mitt Romney's family's from Mexico because they're part of the original clan that left,
*  the clan of Mormons that wanted to fuck 80 wives,
*  and so they moved across the border and they developed these colonies.
*  And so they literally have armed guards to stop them from the cartel.
*  And the cartel just assassinated these women and children.
*  Fuck, man.
*  Nine people just gunned them down.
*  Yeah.
*  The guy, Popeye, from that show, one of the murderers,
*  he's still out and does tours of the cathedral and all those places,
*  and he will put a gun to your head, a loaded gun, and let you take a picture.
*  For a selfie?
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  He killed so many people.
*  Oh my God.
*  So, so many people.
*  Dude, when I was-
*  He did a full turn.
*  Who the fuck is taking a gun selfie with that guy?
*  Oh, he's a celebrity there.
*  I, when I was in Australia, I was fucking wasted, and I came out of some bar.
*  I was with my tour manager, really a bodies of hells angel guy.
*  I'm fucking stumbling out of a bar.
*  And this guy comes up with a gun, and he goes,
*  hey, Burt, can you take a picture of holding a gun to my head?
*  And I was like, yeah.
*  I just took a picture of holding a gun to his head.
*  My tour manager was like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  And I was like, oh no, I just fucking left.
*  There will be a picture of me holding a gun to someone's head.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  He's like, don't worry, it's not loaded.
*  And I'm like, it's your fucking head, man.
*  I feel like I didn't care either way.
*  I was so fucking wasted.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  They actually made a whole series about Popeye.
*  About Popeye?
*  You can see on Netflix.
*  About Popeye?
*  Just about that guy?
*  But it's a dramatization.
*  That's the guy?
*  He's got a YouTube channel.
*  That's the real guy, yeah.
*  That's the real guy.
*  On one of the pieces of glass, he signed Popeye in the dust.
*  So he was Escobar's right-hand man.
*  And he's got 1.18 million subscribers?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my god.
*  Bro, how do I get on his podcast?
*  He's in jail right now.
*  I just Googled it.
*  He got arrested in May.
*  He's back?
*  He got arrested in May.
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, but he's been out for a while.
*  He served like 15, 20 years in Colombian prison,
*  which is like a fucking...
*  And last year, in prison with Escobar.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  That was a different thing.
*  He did that too.
*  He was in the cathedral.
*  So that cathedral, great view.
*  It's awesome.
*  You see the whole meting below you?
*  He built this amazing jail.
*  Dude, he would bring in...
*  A helicopter pad?
*  He would bring in the Colombian national soccer team and be like,
*  play with me today.
*  And they're like, okay.
*  Because if we don't, that's a problem.
*  So the national team would just play.
*  It'd be like, I want the Lakers here now.
*  And they're like, they're here.
*  Ready to play.
*  They are.
*  They're ready.
*  They had a game tonight.
*  But they canceled it.
*  See what happened with the cartel in Mexico where they had El Chapo's son.
*  They had him arrested and then the fucking cartel got in a shootout with the Mexican.
*  That was this year.
*  Yeah.
*  And they released him.
*  That's how strong.
*  You can have him.
*  At some point, you got to be like, this isn't worth it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what was really crazy...
*  I've got this guy, Ed Calderon, who's been on my podcast before.
*  He's coming on again.
*  He's one of the guys that works with the Mexican military to deal with situations
*  that are caused by the cartel.
*  And he said that there was a situation with Trump,
*  because Trump was saying that they were going to treat the Mexican cartel like a
*  terrorist organization.
*  And they were going to literally...
*  Because those Mormons got killed.
*  And they were going to start literally a military operation to go after the cartel.
*  So this is at least on the table.
*  This is on the table.
*  At least on the table.
*  And they were talked out of it by the Mexican government.
*  I wonder what type of firepower they actually have.
*  They must have tanks.
*  I'm saying people think, yeah, people think, well, they definitely have some big guns.
*  And I bet they have shit that you...
*  Billions and billions of dollars.
*  Like maybe some nuclear shit.
*  Billions.
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows how much money they have.
*  Yeah.
*  Imagine if you're like the middle man between the cartel and whatever,
*  Saudi arms dealer, and you're just like, we can't sell you stuff.
*  And they're like, here's fucking $16 billion.
*  Bro, how crazy is Sean Penn?
*  I was just thinking that.
*  Sean Penn went down there to write an article for Rolling Stone.
*  To where?
*  Went and met with El Chapo.
*  And he's one of the reasons why El Chapo got caught.
*  He's the reason El Chapo got caught.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Bro.
*  What do you mean the reason he got caught?
*  Because they followed him.
*  He went with the actress.
*  El Chapo loved this Mexican actress.
*  And he was like, I want to meet her.
*  So he's palling around with El Chapo.
*  I want that shit so bad.
*  I would love to meet Kim Jong-un like that.
*  You got to get that shirt.
*  You could totally pull that shirt off.
*  I could definitely pull that shirt off.
*  You ever see when Conor McGregor bought that same shirt and was taking pictures?
*  He was.
*  He peed this one?
*  With that same pose?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Conor was doing the same pose and not telling anyone.
*  And so everybody had to figure out what the fuck Conor was doing.
*  Look at him.
*  Look at his face.
*  That might be my favorite thing ever.
*  He's just a fucking animal.
*  God damn, I love that guy.
*  Come on, man.
*  Pretty fucking close.
*  There's nothing better in the world than a joke that no one gets but you.
*  He wasn't explaining it at all.
*  He was like, yeah.
*  And people picked up on it.
*  It's just the handshake thing.
*  I mean, Conor is normally like, you know, putting his fist in people's faces and talking shit.
*  And in that one, he's got his hand out like he's going to shake hands.
*  Look at this.
*  It's like the same thing.
*  He's holding his hand out.
*  Dos Anos isn't even thinking about shaking his hand.
*  He's not even looking to get his handshake.
*  Look at Dana White.
*  Dana White's going, I'm going to make so much money.
*  Oh my God, I'm going to make so much money for this.
*  Didn't Conor McGregor's fight already sell out?
*  The cowboy fight?
*  Yeah.
*  Sold out $10 million at the gate.
*  Sure.
*  You guys want to go?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  I'll get up.
*  January 18th?
*  Ooh, is it a week?
*  I'm free on the 18th.
*  You know what?
*  I could cancel Australia.
*  Jamie's going.
*  Jamie, you're going, right?
*  You should cancel Australia.
*  This is the one thing I'm going to take you up on.
*  I definitely want to go.
*  Are we going for the first time?
*  No, no.
*  I've been before.
*  You went finally.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Please cancel Australia.
*  You should only cancel Australia.
*  You should never do it.
*  And every two years, plan a tour and then cancel it.
*  I get so many messages about it.
*  When is your shows in Australia?
*  I leave here the 14th.
*  Why don't you move them?
*  Yeah.
*  Just make a call to your agent.
*  That's what I'm doing.
*  That's why we have agents, right?
*  Listen, it's another country.
*  They won't even notice.
*  That's true.
*  They don't watch this, right?
*  No.
*  All right.
*  Birdie Boy World Tour picks up January 30th, everybody.
*  Why Birdie Boy?
*  What is Birdie Boy?
*  It's what my kids call me.
*  Oh, that's cute.
*  My kids and my wife, everyone calls me Birdie Boy.
*  Oh, Birdie Boy.
*  Yeah.
*  Just put tickets.
*  Added shows, everyone.
*  Go to birdbirdbird.com.
*  Look at that.
*  There's a plug.
*  We didn't even see it coming.
*  Tom was better with his plug about Australia.
*  Good job, buddy.
*  Still got us little tickets, huh?
*  It's been sold out for a while.
*  That dance video didn't hurt, did it?
*  How did you respond when you saw yourself get stabbed?
*  I was a little confused.
*  And then I was like, I was like, was that me?
*  It was very aggressive.
*  Very aggressive.
*  I didn't understand the carrot either.
*  What was up with the carrot?
*  It's from Steven Seagal.
*  That's who I was dressed as.
*  The president of Belarus gave him a carrot.
*  It's like the Connor thing.
*  The president of Belarus gave him a carrot one time.
*  And then Seagal just ate it.
*  It's just weird.
*  So I just started it with the carrot.
*  You had the same outfit and everything.
*  And the fucking hair.
*  And the hair.
*  The glasses.
*  The fucking jet black hair.
*  That hair is so ridiculous.
*  It's like 62 in this photo.
*  Do you remember when we were wearing the whoops
*  and you said one day, Tom, your numbers were through the roof.
*  And he was like, I got lost in the canyons.
*  And you were filming the thing?
*  It was when he was filming and he was dancing all day.
*  It was my, what's it called on whoop?
*  It's your exertion.
*  The activity level.
*  Right.
*  19.8 that day.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like it was 5,800 calories burned.
*  It was fucking, it was killer.
*  Well, you remember that one day where I burned 6,000 calories.
*  You're like, what the fuck?
*  What were you doing?
*  It's elk hunting.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Just running all day.
*  Going up the mountains.
*  But just hauling gear.
*  And it took 10 hours a day.
*  That's how you got us in the strap the year before.
*  It was all day long.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I got you because I'm a psycho.
*  Yeah.
*  Really.
*  I was going to get you no matter what.
*  I told you guys, you got to be ready to die.
*  But I told you.
*  That's why we wanted you in the dance video.
*  We wanted to see what you would do.
*  That's stabbing.
*  Joe, I'm telling you right now.
*  Hey, Joe.
*  You will break the two of us in half crying, laughing.
*  If just one day on your own you film some dance video that's better than ours, you realize.
*  That's good.
*  Keep going like that.
*  And it surprised us.
*  Surprised us.
*  I like the way you're rolling it.
*  It's cute.
*  It's cute.
*  I laughed so hard.
*  Ari had actually talked about it.
*  Ari had a great idea.
*  About doing one?
*  Yeah.
*  Ari had a great idea of us recreating the scene from Dirty Dancing.
*  Me and him.
*  Beat for beat.
*  God.
*  That's exactly what we're talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  Just guys, just take a weekend.
*  It's just, it all takes a weekend.
*  Well, I would have to catch him.
*  He's not going to catch me.
*  No shit.
*  And that's a lot of, what do you weigh like a buck 70 at least, right?
*  Yeah, around 75.
*  So a buck 70 like that, that's a lot of weight, man.
*  You got to be prepared.
*  I would have to train for that.
*  You have to train for it.
*  I would have to do a lot of heavy kettlebells.
*  Because that's dead weight.
*  Here it is.
*  Here's the scene.
*  This is, well, this is all seen.
*  You know.
*  This is Ari in San, okay, this is awkward.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm crying laughing.
*  I'm crying laughing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  This is going to be a problem no matter what because he's a foot tall.
*  You've got to wear that dress.
*  You've got to wear that dress.
*  Oh, obviously.
*  I already have the dress.
*  And the nose.
*  And the nose.
*  The nose is already Jewish.
*  Miss Grey is.
*  The nose is close.
*  Yeah.
*  He'd kiss me though.
*  The problem is if we got that close, Ari would sneak in and kiss.
*  He definitely would.
*  And throw up in his face.
*  Joe.
*  Keep going.
*  Look at this.
*  You guys got to do this.
*  Nope.
*  Not doing it.
*  Dude, I learned how to dance for that fucking Zookeeper movie.
*  It was a long two weeks of learning.
*  And I got to dance with Leslie Bibb who's hot and cool.
*  I'm hot.
*  I'm cool.
*  You're cool.
*  All right.
*  Please give me cool.
*  I wish Jennifer Grey didn't get her nose fixed.
*  Yeah.
*  Her and Renee Zellweger.
*  Renee Zellweger did some weird stuff, right?
*  Like she's a different human.
*  I don't know.
*  You know who else looked good?
*  She was great in that fucking movie about Judy Garland.
*  I heard she was great.
*  She was amazing.
*  Did you see Meg Ryan?
*  She went away.
*  Oh yeah.
*  She had a bunch of stuff.
*  And then she looked totally different.
*  Once you do the lips, man.
*  No, she didn't look horrible.
*  She just looked so different.
*  She looked unrecognizable as herself.
*  Yeah, lips.
*  You do your lips.
*  It's like the Fibonacci sequence is all off.
*  Yeah.
*  You look at someone's lips, their lips are off.
*  You're like, hey, what the?
*  I didn't know Eliza had a nose job.
*  She was explaining to me that she had a nose job.
*  And I go, oh, well, it's a fucking good one.
*  So I paid a lot of money for it.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  See, this is what happens when women get the facelift.
*  Their mouth gets too big.
*  It's like, why is it?
*  Yeah, because you're pulling your mouth on the sides.
*  So the hole is larger than your mouth.
*  Right?
*  So you have this.
*  Wow.
*  She was so beautiful.
*  So hot in the Presidio.
*  Is that like that right then?
*  It's rough being a lady, man.
*  You know, because when you're a guy and you get older,
*  you're just a guy who's older.
*  When you're a woman, all your power is gone.
*  Right?
*  All the doors are open for you because you're attractive.
*  You're beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  And in our plastic surgery works.
*  The guys that have plugs.
*  No, it doesn't.
*  No, hold on.
*  Bullshit.
*  The guys who have hair transplants today, you cannot fucking tell.
*  Yeah, but it depends on your hair.
*  Right?
*  I have thin hair.
*  It's fine.
*  My hair is fine.
*  So when I got a hair transplant, even when I had it, it was still ratty.
*  And it kept falling out.
*  At a certain point in time, I had to make a decision.
*  That Bill Burbitt where he's like, get it today.
*  Not 20 years ago when it looked like you got ants legs stapled to your forehead.
*  I got it before that.
*  I mean, after that.
*  I didn't know you had them done before.
*  I haven't shown them.
*  I had them scarred in the back of my head.
*  So I'd smile.
*  Looks like somebody axed him.
*  It's a public service announcement for anybody thinking about getting a hair transplant.
*  Go look at my head.
*  Don't do that.
*  Tom's thinking about it.
*  He's beautiful.
*  He doesn't need that.
*  He wants me to give him my hair.
*  Yes.
*  Ball hair.
*  Because he's like, you got so much hair, Bert.
*  Imagine if you just did your ball hair.
*  My ball hair is so thick.
*  My ball hair goes all the way up to my belly button.
*  If I just took my ball hair and put it on my head.
*  You should do it.
*  Your ball hair can reach to your belly button.
*  Oh, dude, when I don't shave, I'm a gorilla.
*  My back is hairy.
*  Everything's hairy.
*  It's as I get older, I'm hairier.
*  My ears are hairy now.
*  I have to trim my fucking ears.
*  Yeah, my ears.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, the fuck is going on with my head?
*  You turned into an ape.
*  Start scratching.
*  I'm like, goddamn.
*  And then it's a hair.
*  Just a hair tickling your hair.
*  As you get older, you become more of a gorilla.
*  My ass hairs tie together when I run.
*  Your ass hair.
*  From cheek to cheek, like a bridge.
*  I have to take my finger and swipe it out.
*  You know what I've done?
*  You definitely smell that finger.
*  Three times.
*  Only three times in my life.
*  For sure.
*  100%.
*  He says he doesn't smell his bad parts.
*  What do you mean?
*  That if he gets inside the belly button?
*  I smell everything.
*  OK.
*  Oh, you fucking liar.
*  Yeah, I always just try to make you look worse.
*  I shaved my asshole three times in my life.
*  And every time, I'm amazed at what my farts sound like.
*  That is the most insightful.
*  Crazy.
*  I got a full bourgeoisie wax one time.
*  And for a TV show.
*  Your farts, all of a sudden, like who's farting in my pants?
*  How about wiping?
*  Yeah, you're like, oh.
*  I have to.
*  Dude, I try to hold my shit until I get to the studio.
*  Because of these goddamn bidets.
*  The toilet seats with the electric.
*  Oh my god, it's amazing.
*  It's amazing.
*  Hot, warm water squirting up your butthole.
*  You don't have that at home?
*  So it's clean.
*  No, I need to get it.
*  You got to do it.
*  I know, I'm slipping.
*  I've used it.
*  We ordered it too.
*  I have it.
*  I just haven't had it installed yet.
*  I've just been too busy.
*  I've used yours.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, it's amazing.
*  It's the best.
*  It's amazing.
*  When I have it at home, and then I'm home for like 10 days,
*  and then you go on the road, you're like, I'm a monster.
*  I'm a fucking monster.
*  You're smearing shit.
*  You're not even cleaning it.
*  No.
*  When I got my Brazilian wax, I remember the first time I farted,
*  it was like my ass cheeks were clapping.
*  Yeah.
*  It goes, brrrap.
*  And you're like, shut the fuck up.
*  What is happening with the hair in that air?
*  Hair is muffling your fart.
*  It's muffling.
*  You're fucked.
*  It's so weird.
*  You're the first person I ever said, because no one's ever
*  can relate to that.
*  And I've always said, man, my farts were so fucking loud.
*  That's because your other friends are grownups.
*  Did you have a scientist on here yesterday?
*  Biologists and shit, people looking for lost species.
*  Hey, do you let the water on the bidet go into your asshole sometimes?
*  Right in there.
*  And I have to shit.
*  And then it goes out.
*  You can almost flush it out.
*  If I have a shit that's kind of halfway stuck,
*  I go take a shit.
*  And then I start cleaning.
*  I'm like, I think there's more up there.
*  And so I'll just really concentrate that jet right in my butthole.
*  And it gets in there.
*  And then all of a sudden, yikes.
*  It's like there was a castaway.
*  There was some hidden shit that was trying to hang out in there.
*  Yep.
*  And then it just makes it.
*  I love that.
*  It breaks the O-ring.
*  Yeah.
*  You take a sloppy shit, and you're like, eww.
*  And then you let it run a full cycle.
*  A full cycle.
*  And then you wipe, and there's something still there.
*  There you go.
*  I got problems.
*  This would have been a problem in 97.
*  That's the problem with hair.
*  Sometimes I wipe it with hair.
*  And the width of the smear is so disgusting.
*  Then I just take a shower.
*  I go straight to shit showers.
*  You shit shower all the time.
*  You go with no wiping.
*  No wipe.
*  You're fucking ill.
*  I wipe first.
*  Why?
*  Because it's too much.
*  I don't want shit in the floor and the top.
*  You don't leave it there.
*  Of course.
*  It goes down.
*  You're fucking out of your mind.
*  You're not cleaning it good, though.
*  You know what?
*  You don't clean the floor.
*  You've got shit bacteria on your floor.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Stop it with the drain.
*  Joey Diaz is telling me a story once about how he had to take a shit.
*  So he took a shit in the bathtub.
*  And then he had to smush it with his foot to go down the drain.
*  And it all wouldn't go down.
*  It doesn't have to be too bad to use the toilet.
*  Dude.
*  He would put it between his feet.
*  Dude, he told me a few times.
*  Do you remember those logs?
*  He used to leave logs.
*  And he'd say, come look at this.
*  And he used to go in there.
*  No, no.
*  When he was really big.
*  He couldn't read his ass.
*  He could shit.
*  He pushed him front of the toilet.
*  He had too much ass.
*  He couldn't get all the way back there.
*  So his giant shits would land on the beach in front of the water.
*  They didn't land on the water.
*  So they never really flushed.
*  Oh my god.
*  So you just see them.
*  And they're like, brr.
*  He sends me photos.
*  No, all the time.
*  Still, yeah.
*  Shits.
*  All the time.
*  Now that he texts, he's texting like a fucking ninth grader.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like, yo, you see the monkey on this chick?
*  Yeah, he sends me pictures.
*  Everything.
*  Dude, my shits in Colombia from all the just greasy, oily,
*  bonuelos and chicharrones.
*  It was the consistent, many times a day.
*  And it was just consistent.
*  It was just.
*  Probably helps.
*  It's like softer.
*  It was like if you fed a puppy too many treats.
*  Bro, when Marsha was a puppy, one thing that happens to some dogs
*  is when they're babies, they try to eat their shit.
*  And so he was shitting and trying to eat it at the same time.
*  So he'd spin around in a circle and try to bite it as it was coming out of the hole.
*  So he was trying to eat it right out of the tap.
*  Right out of his ass.
*  Joey told me one time that he was about shitting in the shower.
*  And he was like, yeah, it was great.
*  I did it all the time.
*  I was like, you fucking shit in the shower.
*  He's like, yeah.
*  He goes, and then he's like, if it's like a log, I just shit.
*  And then I just toss it to the toilet.
*  And I was like, oh, man.
*  Oh, no way.
*  And then he said that.
*  How much practice does he have in doing that?
*  He must have missed before.
*  A couple pieces of paper, you go for the can, and you miss.
*  Oh, missing that.
*  Missing would be so bad.
*  He said that, I go, did you stop?
*  That's so fucking revolting.
*  He goes, I had to.
*  My wife saw me do it one time.
*  And she said, no more.
*  No, my wife saw me do it.
*  Can you imagine walking in on someone with shit in their hand like that?
*  Throwing shit?
*  Oh my god, it's hilarious.
*  I didn't want to live in the bathtub.
*  I farted once in the shower, and I shit all over the place.
*  You did?
*  Yeah.
*  I wasn't feeling that good.
*  And I farted just all over the floor.
*  But I have one of those handheld jammies.
*  And I just had to rinse it down.
*  I was in that shower for like a half an hour.
*  And then I squirt shampoo all over the bottom.
*  You go, this will do it.
*  This will clean it.
*  Like it's a murder scene.
*  And then I left.
*  And then I came back in just to get a fresh smell of it.
*  Because all factory sensors are weird because they don't detect smell.
*  They detect changes in smell.
*  That's right.
*  That's why people in Pennsylvania who live near those cattle ranches.
*  Oh, they don't smell it anymore.
*  They don't smell shit anymore.
*  My parents used to live in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.
*  And I used to go to drive to visit them from the city.
*  Oh my god, there's a stretch that you drive.
*  It's all just cattle ranches.
*  Just horrible fucking smell.
*  I'll be there on the Buddy Boy Tour.
*  It's a great town.
*  It's a great town.
*  It smells like what?
*  They'll be happy there.
*  It smells like death and shit.
*  Because two things that are happening there, slaughterhouses and fucking cow shit.
*  So you just get this...
*  Look, that methane stuff that they talk about like being a contributor to greenhouse gases,
*  that's fucking legit.
*  100%.
*  And apparently they can do something about that if they just add a certain amount of
*  seaweed to a cow's diet.
*  You just blew my mind.
*  So smell is the change in smell that you notice.
*  It's not the smell.
*  Right.
*  That's why people stink.
*  Don't notice they stink.
*  That's also why when you smoke a joint, you don't notice it.
*  But everybody else around you, they come, oh my god, you guys are high as fuck.
*  They come in the room and they smell weed.
*  Why Indian people can live at Indian people's homes.
*  Oh, you piece of shit.
*  Bro, it's curry.
*  It's not bad.
*  I had Indian food tonight.
*  I love Indian food.
*  First time I ever had...
*  I never had Indian food.
*  When I was in Russia, we got lap dances from these strippers and they had all eaten Indian
*  food.
*  I'd never smelled curry before.
*  Farting on you.
*  So I'd only grown up in Florida.
*  We didn't have Indian restaurants and I lived in Tallahassee and the smell was so disgusting.
*  I was like, these are the most disgusting smelling women I've ever been with.
*  Katsu, probably 15 years later, I'm having dinner with my wife.
*  First time I ever had Indian food and they bring it...
*  While we walk in the restaurant and I go, dude, this smells like a Russian hooker.
*  It's coming off the cup of my pants.
*  And I realize, I've almost been Indian food.
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious.
*  So that blows my mind.
*  It's just the change in smell that you notice.
*  That's why when you fart...
*  Yeah, right.
*  You smell it.
*  You smell for a second.
*  Yeah, but you're also...
*  All factory senses are designed to detect changes.
*  You're not...
*  Your body...
*  Your brain sends a signal to you that you smell...
*  And that's why it doesn't affect you as much as someone else's.
*  No, there's something about this...
*  This fucking is blowing my mind right now.
*  That's why people that smell don't know they smell.
*  Well, there's also a thing about your farts that smell good to you because
*  there's something in your body...
*  It's like there's something in your brain that triggers that you're having a relief.
*  It's like there's a buildup and then you smell the smell and it's like, ah...
*  Because it signifies the relief.
*  You know that feeling when you have to fart.
*  It's like, oh, when you're in your car and you fart and then you start
*  wafting the smell up, you're like, oh, not bad.
*  It's like, it's pretty bad.
*  I'll fart in a pillow and take it to the face.
*  I love my farts.
*  That's so much.
*  Do you ever do...
*  You just take it over here.
*  Do you ever fart in your bed and your wife is in the bathroom and you're like,
*  oh my God, I gotta get a pillow out, fucking fan.
*  Fan.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  That's when I go...
*  In the cupboard.
*  That's when I hold it down and I go, hey, do me a favor.
*  Bad person.
*  Check under the bed.
*  Tom and I are good people.
*  Tom and I are good people.
*  Tom's a good dude.
*  Oh, please.
*  No, he is not.
*  I know what I do is I do more theatrical stuff.
*  I'll take this to the next...
*  I want to hear your story.
*  Well, I do things like I'll do leg kicks as I fart or I'll pull my legs back like I'm
*  changing my diaper kind of position.
*  She doesn't like it at all.
*  She doesn't like it at all.
*  My mom today farted for like 12 seconds.
*  His mom farts epically for all farts.
*  Give me a fucking heads up if you're gonna do this.
*  That one that your mom did when you caught her in the kitchen and then she turns and
*  looks at you.
*  The look on her face was...
*  You need to take her to a doctor.
*  Oh.
*  There might be something going on.
*  Standard operating procedure.
*  Of all life?
*  All life.
*  Wow.
*  Yes.
*  I'm telling you, today she broke it easily and I go, why don't you fucking tell me so
*  I can record it?
*  And she goes, give me $150,000.
*  $150,000?
*  Give me $150,000?
*  Tom, I'll give her $150,000 for that part of the video.
*  Yeah, it's pretty impressive.
*  Hold on, let's hear this.
*  Let's hear this.
*  Let's hear this.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Go from the beginning.
*  Hold on, before you play, were you just randomly filming her?
*  You weren't thinking it was coming, were you?
*  No, no, here's what's happened.
*  I said something about...
*  I go, yeah, you think you have one?
*  And she didn't...
*  She thought we were just bantering.
*  You think you have one?
*  Fart.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And I saw her just turn and I go, oh, I think she might...
*  And the beauty of these things is I pull it out and I just hit the camera from the lock screen
*  and then she just didn't know.
*  Let me hear this.
*  Oh, this is the loop.
*  This is the loop.
*  This is the loop.
*  This is the loop.
*  The look on her face when she turns around, she sees that camera pointed at her.
*  Slow motion.
*  Look, she's smiling right there.
*  She's smiling right there.
*  You don't know my son anymore.
*  You don't know my son.
*  I said it now?
*  You don't know my son anymore.
*  Oh, and I made merch that said, you don't know my son anymore.
*  And I would send it to the house.
*  She got so mad.
*  Oh my God.
*  She's the Argentinian?
*  She's Peruvian.
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious.
*  Best one I ever did is when the girls were little, like babies, I farted in a McDonald's cup
*  and I put my hand over it and I went...
*  Like a Scooby-Doo scream?
*  Poison your babies?
*  I go, girls, I just caught a butterfly and they're like, what?
*  Both of them are like, I don't smell that.
*  Like literally, immediately.
*  You did it to me once at the Irvine improv.
*  Oh, it's a good one.
*  You capture a fart in a cup?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  If it happens...
*  He let out like a...
*  Like, you know when it's like hot death?
*  Yeah, when you feel warm.
*  When you're warm.
*  It's warm and then you're like...
*  It's also rotten.
*  This is like a rotten one.
*  Right, right.
*  I was across the lobby from him in the club and he was like, hey, come here, come here, come here.
*  He signaled like, I gotta tell you something.
*  I go, what?
*  And I ran up and it just hit me like a brick to the face.
*  Dude, I have sometimes with my stomach...
*  I told this to Tom a long time ago on our podcast.
*  I took a shit in Japan once that was so bad.
*  The guy in the stall next to me threw up.
*  And joke, we were in Japan, I thought he was talking to me.
*  He's like, I don't know what you're saying.
*  No Japanese.
*  Dude, by the way, that's happened twice.
*  It happened once in Denver.
*  I've made people throw up.
*  There's something so strange about public toilets where you're shitting
*  inches away from some other person shitting.
*  Especially airports.
*  It's so weird.
*  Airports, international shits.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when it's like 30 of you just sitting there.
*  You all came from eating in countries.
*  Different bacteria.
*  That's what's so strange about those hookup spots for some creepy gay dudes.
*  Yeah.
*  Where they would find a spot like...
*  Can you believe that?
*  Yeah.
*  They meet in toilets in...
*  Like remember there was that one...
*  Was it a senator that got busted?
*  Yeah.
*  Topping.
*  Minnesota.
*  Yeah.
*  Minnesota.
*  Wait, wasn't he from Idaho?
*  But it was in Minnesota.
*  It was in Minnesota.
*  He was a senator from Idaho.
*  And he goes, no, I was just tapping to see if he was there.
*  He's the creepiest guy.
*  Craig, I think, was his last name.
*  He's the one who said...
*  When Clinton was in trouble, he was like,
*  Clinton has been a very naughty boy, dare I say, a nasty boy.
*  Oh.
*  The weirdest thing an adult man has ever said.
*  But we're looking at you now.
*  Yeah.
*  Somebody who says it like that, that word selection, dare I say, a nasty boy.
*  These were around before the internet.
*  Yeah.
*  But this is probably...
*  Where they get away with it, how do you think?
*  But they probably had, like, there he is, Larry Craig.
*  Wide stance, arrest turns 10.
*  Oh yeah, that was his thing.
*  I have a wide stance.
*  I got a wide stance.
*  Is he a wide stance?
*  Oh my god, he has a wide stance to go to the bathroom.
*  So he was putting his feet...
*  I overreacted and made a poor decision, Craig said of his guilty plea.
*  Let me be clear, I am not gay.
*  Why is he playing guilty then?
*  It's just easier, Ari.
*  Yeah, it's easier.
*  Whenever I shit and people get mad at me, I just say, I'm guilty.
*  I'm guilty.
*  I'm guilty.
*  What did I do?
*  You know what, guys, this is a lot easier than the paperwork.
*  He argued that the arresting officer misconstrued his actions.
*  What are the odds that you try to get an officer to suck your dick?
*  But here's the thing, though.
*  What if an officer is one of those cops that sets up speed traps?
*  What if you're not gay?
*  And he's just like, yeah, I need to make a collar.
*  I'm here looking for guys to suck my dick and there's nothing.
*  Yeah.
*  I haven't had a single bite.
*  Make a collar.
*  I'm just trying to put out a fight.
*  Right, he's out there trying to fish and he's got a fucking stick of dynamite.
*  I'm just going to chuck this in the water.
*  See what happens.
*  They caught a senator.
*  Wow.
*  What a fucking land.
*  Yeah, but here's the thing.
*  Yeah, what a land.
*  If you really, I mean, if you really didn't do this, you definitely are not like that.
*  Under the divider hand motions and played footsie in an attempt to arrange a sexual
*  encounter.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Prove that.
*  Prove that.
*  Prove what?
*  Prove that he's trying to arrange a sexual encounter.
*  Maybe he just needed toilet paper.
*  But they didn't.
*  He just pled guilty because he panicked.
*  Did you hear about the guy recently that got busted?
*  He was a pastor and he got busted trying to pay for gay sex with an Arby's card.
*  An Arby's card?
*  An Arby's card.
*  He pulled out the wrong card to a narc or to an undercover officer.
*  He was going to pay credit?
*  Yeah.
*  He tried, he was like on a sugar daddy site.
*  And he's like, I've had a lot of sugar daddies.
*  You know, my sugar babies.
*  This guy, Missouri church leader, tried to pay for sex on Grindr.
*  That's what it is.
*  With an Arby's card.
*  An Arby's card.
*  Hey, I guess so.
*  He looks, he looks gay.
*  Listen, I think prostitution, prostitution in the gay community is a different animal.
*  What's the D in D?
*  I'd like to fuck.
*  Dad?
*  I think it's much more acceptable.
*  Don't you think?
*  I think.
*  Definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, they don't give a fuck.
*  It's more, it's more rugby rules as opposed to American football rules.
*  They're just like, whatever happens, man.
*  Let's just get the ball to that side.
*  Grab nuts in the scrum.
*  But also like, isn't it the need for the prostitution so much less, right?
*  Like, I feel like guys are just like, let's just fucking fuck.
*  Yeah, why do you have to do the thing?
*  Here's the thing, because old guys, they want to fuck young guys.
*  And these young guys don't want to fuck them.
*  But these young guys don't have a car.
*  They're like, hey, I know what's up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I know how to make something happen.
*  Remember that Patrice O'Neill story where he said he pulled over to rest stop to get some sleep
*  and somebody knocked on his window.
*  He was like way off, like away from like the store was.
*  And he's like, what?
*  And the guy was like, hi.
*  And he's like, what?
*  And the guy's like, oh, my bad.
*  He goes, you're bad?
*  What?
*  What are you doing here?
*  And the guy just turned and ran away.
*  Oh, well, that's the spot.
*  Rest stops.
*  Right?
*  Gay guys before they had these apps and ways to meet up.
*  A quality.
*  Yeah.
*  Craigslist.
*  They used to have to have like little secret spots.
*  Rest stops were always the secret spot.
*  What was the singer George Michael thing?
*  Right?
*  It was like a park.
*  Yeah.
*  In Beverly Hills.
*  In Beverly Hills, right?
*  Yeah.
*  But you know that shit had to be bumping in the fucking 80s.
*  Going to that park, I'm sure every gay dude in the city was like, I'll see you in BH, man.
*  I'm just like that has got to be the spot.
*  Certain parks, you know.
*  Remember when the guy from.
*  Let's go shopping afterwards, man.
*  Fucking Rodeo's right there.
*  How great would that be if the day after you found out about that park, you're like, wait,
*  wait, wait, that park?
*  And you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, around noon.
*  You're like, restroom though, right?
*  Wasn't a restroom.
*  The infamous George Michael bathroom.
*  I guess so.
*  Yeah.
*  But is the bathroom at a park, man?
*  It's got to be fucking rough to be gay and just try to meet guys.
*  And are you serious?
*  Shut up.
*  In the 90s.
*  I was like.
*  90s, it must have still.
*  It still must have been easy.
*  Well.
*  Remember the rule was like if you had like a certain color handkerchief,
*  that meant what you were into.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And you would have it out of your back pocket.
*  There was a day at Florida State if you wore blue jeans.
*  Blue jeans.
*  Blue jeans?
*  It was coming out.
*  Florida people were just trying to fuck dudes.
*  They should have something more specific than that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a mistake waiting to happen.
*  What if you don't get online?
*  You don't know.
*  It's like having t-shirt day.
*  And your fucking shorts are dirty.
*  So I'll just put my blue jeans on today.
*  You know, some guys are trying to fuck you.
*  Hey, man.
*  You know, sorry, I didn't have anything else to wear.
*  Blue jeans.
*  Christina went to.
*  That's so crazy.
*  It is crazy.
*  Christina went to University of San Francisco.
*  She said in the 90s, I think it's the Folsom Street Fair or something.
*  Guys would fist in the streets.
*  Yikes.
*  Wow.
*  Fisting.
*  Yeah, she's like, I saw guys butt fucking just up on the wall.
*  I saw two dudes butt fuck.
*  The first day in New York, I went out with the editor of Us Magazine.
*  He took me to a gay bar in the Meatpacking District.
*  And I saw a dude, can't be alive anymore.
*  Stars tattooed on his butt cheeks down to his heel like he was a big Cowboys fan.
*  But fucking.
*  And I saw him get fucked in the ass and I was fresh out of Florida State.
*  Jesus.
*  Where?
*  On the street?
*  No, no, no.
*  In a bar.
*  It was in a bar.
*  He got fucked in the ass in a bar?
*  In a bar just on this dude's lap.
*  And I was like, dude, I was like this.
*  I remember the first.
*  New York.
*  I bet if there's some gay guys that miss those days.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yes.
*  That are like, that was when we were fucking outlaws.
*  Of course.
*  Pre-AIDS days must have been amazing.
*  Jeff Scott, the piano player at the Comedy Store, talked about pre-AIDS.
*  When he was in a theater troupe before AIDS and he was like, it was a fuckfest.
*  I bet a lot of guys got into musicals that didn't even like musicals.
*  So this is the deal.
*  I gotta learn how to sing.
*  Yeah, Chicago's not that bad.
*  They probably just had to find a spot.
*  Where's the spot?
*  Where do we go?
*  How many guys wear cologne that actually like cologne?
*  Zero.
*  They're wearing cologne because they think it might in some way up their chance of getting laid.
*  My rationale has always been any girl that will only fuck you because you're wearing cologne,
*  don't fuck that girl.
*  Right.
*  That's a mess.
*  Yeah.
*  You're making a mistake.
*  You know, the thing is about cologne, speaking of like change in your smell,
*  I feel like I can go like a long stretch now without like picking up on cologne.
*  Like you, I'll feel like I don't run in and then all of a sudden someone,
*  a fucking Uber driver or something, you're like, Jesus.
*  Or you get on an elevator and you're like, dude, where are you from?
*  I love those people.
*  They're like, they're trying to cover something else.
*  You just got here?
*  They don't do that here, man.
*  You don't wear cologne.
*  Cologne?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Who wears you?
*  No.
*  Fuck no.
*  That's a business I would not invest in.
*  Burt Kreischer cologne.
*  I just started using toothpaste again.
*  It smells like lemongrass.
*  Soap.
*  Burt Kreischer cologne.
*  Shut up.
*  I don't like toothpaste.
*  It fucking creeps me out.
*  What?
*  Yeah, toothpaste bothers me.
*  What do you brush your teeth with?
*  Soap.
*  No way.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  I like to, I like to, dude, look, this is a long unpacking story.
*  Soap's the right reaction.
*  I don't have real teeth, so it doesn't matter.
*  No, I mean your mouth.
*  Like you have a real tongue, right?
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  Don't glance over the real teeth.
*  You're going to hit in the mouth with a baseball bat.
*  You're going to hit in the mouth with a baseball bat.
*  You know, my 11th birthday, we just talked about this the other day.
*  Yeah.
*  Who hit you?
*  My dad.
*  He was, look, it was, no, I'm joking.
*  It was a kid in the game.
*  It was the kid batting.
*  Accident.
*  No, he was trying to break up the play.
*  He was a black kid.
*  He was sick of you talking to him like that.
*  And he.
*  That's where it started.
*  I was a catcher and it was a passball.
*  I blocked it.
*  I picked it up, threw my helmet off, threw it down the third,
*  and the kid tried to break up the play and brought the bat back,
*  hit me in the mouth, knocked out, knocked out, fucked up 26 of my teeth.
*  Wait, can I, I actually forgot to ask you this.
*  What?
*  In that part of the, in the story.
*  Yeah, my 11th birthday.
*  You're playing catcher.
*  You throw the ball to make the play at what?
*  Third, kid was stealing second to go to third.
*  But so the batter has already swung.
*  He already swung.
*  Okay.
*  And now?
*  He brings the bat back into my mouth.
*  Oh, like he just.
*  Brought it back into my mouth.
*  He thought on the spot, he's like, oh, this will maybe I'll pretend it's my full motion.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And brought it back into my mouth.
*  You know, man, I don't, I never talked to the kid at all.
*  My teeth were on home plate.
*  You want to get real about this?
*  This is, you want to talk about parenting?
*  My dad came out.
*  He's like, buddy, it's going to be okay.
*  Your mom's here.
*  We had a birthday party plan for him.
*  Here's my birthday.
*  And he came out and in his hand, he had my fielder's glove.
*  And I went, I was like trying to get,
*  take off the gear.
*  Drew's going to catch, go over to shortstop.
*  And I was like, I don't have any teeth.
*  He was like, yeah, but if I take you out now, we lose the game.
*  Cause I can't sub before the fifth inning.
*  So go over, finish the game.
*  And I go, I don't have any teeth.
*  He goes, don't you.
*  My dad's a good dad.
*  He's not a bad guy, but he was like, hey, don't cry.
*  Go out, finish the inning.
*  It's one out.
*  It's one out.
*  And then we'll take you to the hospital.
*  So I went over to shortstop.
*  I don't know.
*  Stuff like that, I think turns you.
*  Stuff like that.
*  Teaches you.
*  It either breaks you or fucks you up as a guy or it makes you stronger as a guy.
*  What do you think it did to you?
*  I don't know, man.
*  I've had a lot of those moments with my dad where it's like be a fucking man.
*  And I'm glad he did it because there's certain things like I want this.
*  Though, I, man, I remember being it.
*  That's not like a suck it up moment.
*  That's like a no, no, no, it's over.
*  The game's over.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  It's over.
*  Yeah.
*  I have a broken jaw.
*  Everybody go home.
*  There's pizza, pizza now.
*  Your teeth get knocked out.
*  It's very likely there's some fractures in your jaw and they could get infected.
*  It's like a rush to get to the hospital as quick as possible.
*  Do you think your dad was having some sort of PTSD?
*  I'm not in a world title fight.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  You know, trust me.
*  Joe, I was sitting in a short stop going, this doesn't seem fair.
*  This seems like bad parenting.
*  This seems like, my dad's like, if I take you out now, we lose the game.
*  I mean.
*  I don't want to shit on your dad.
*  He was like, I'll give you some Tito's.
*  They'll be fine.
*  I'm just gonna start from the beginning.
*  I don't think, I think I'm fine.
*  I don't know what you guys are talking about.
*  I don't know, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm used to seeing people get fucked up and I think I'd have a real problem with that.
*  I would feel like I would, I think it's a different era.
*  It's a different era.
*  I would panic if I saw, I would panic.
*  I don't know if it was that different.
*  I've brought it up to my dad before.
*  You know, he laughs it off and he goes, you weren't that bad.
*  Who?
*  Can I ask you a question?
*  Shoot.
*  Who won the game?
*  I have no idea.
*  I wasn't there.
*  I went to the doctor, Dr. Boza.
*  Spent the rest of the day in the, getting my teeth fixed.
*  How long did it take before they fixed your teeth?
*  Uh, fucking 20 years.
*  It took, it took forever.
*  It was for, it was a long period.
*  Ninth grade in college, everything was fixed.
*  And that was 11.
*  And ninth grade, I had like ninth grade, I had a smile I was comfortable with.
*  Um, but yeah, I just had fucked up teeth.
*  So it took like three years for you to smile you're comfortable with.
*  Yeah.
*  So what was it before then?
*  Just, uh, it was like, it was like spotty caps, like cosmetic dental.
*  Dental was terrible back then.
*  Terrible.
*  So it was like, I want to say like, this sounds horrible.
*  I want to feel like it was plastic caps.
*  It wasn't like they stained really easy.
*  And so, uh, and I had like two and then these are broken.
*  And then, then at one point I just had four teeth that looked okay.
*  And so, and it's, I mean, there are people listening right now that are going through this,
*  but you just cover your smile at times and you don't enjoy life as much.
*  You smile with your mouth closed.
*  You smile with your mouth closed.
*  You're like, oh, that's funny.
*  It's really funny to think of you like that.
*  I know, right?
*  I think that's why I am who I am is when I got teeth, I was like,
*  I was like, and I was, I was, I was laughing.
*  I remember.
*  She's like perfect now.
*  Thank you so much, Joe.
*  Did they get stained by coffee or anything?
*  Very badly.
*  We were talking about this the other day.
*  Fuckface over here decides his new game.
*  He wants to play a shame my mouth.
*  That's not something Larry Craig would play.
*  This is the opposite of what I was doing.
*  No, him and his fucking evil Nazi wife.
*  Come up with these fucking game plans of ways to just get the focus away from my talent
*  as a comedian and find something else to fucking focus on.
*  But I was, I was going to get my teeth.
*  I was going to get my teeth already done right this, this month.
*  And then I thought, I don't like those dudes or celebrities with like bright white smiles
*  that you go, you just got your teeth done.
*  You look fucking different.
*  They can make them not like that, by the way.
*  Now they can.
*  Like when you get your teeth, if you get veneers now, they do shades of.
*  I want regular man teeth.
*  When you see a man, he's got like regular teeth.
*  Yeah, like you got regular fucking teeth.
*  I got crooked teeth.
*  Your teeth look normal.
*  Yeah.
*  I have no problem with my teeth whatsoever.
*  I'm fine.
*  I wouldn't mind a couple of them getting them shaded out to the, to match everything else.
*  But I got one dark one.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's from smoke and cigars and drinking coffee.
*  If someone gets a dead tooth and then that one tooth is kind of gray and I lost somebody.
*  I know somebody with that.
*  Dead teeth are weird.
*  Like a prominent dead tooth.
*  And you just want to be like, why do you have a car?
*  You should fix this first.
*  Take Uber everywhere and get your teeth done.
*  Yeah, the dead teeth are weird, right?
*  It's like there's something about it signals to you.
*  There's something wrong with that person.
*  You see a person with a missing tooth.
*  Like, ooh, what other shit decisions are you making?
*  Well, I know that like a lot of people would.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's the thing is that it's like the one of the first things you notice.
*  You know, somebody if they have a wonky eye, for sure.
*  And then teeth.
*  Dead teeth.
*  Yeah.
*  Dead teeth.
*  But a lot of people, you know, it is expensive, you know, to address that.
*  But my thing has always been when somebody is like, you know, something about dental,
*  they'll go, you know, well, it's whatever, thousands of dollars.
*  I go, go into debt.
*  You should buy debt right now because-
*  Yeah, your life might improve.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It's worth it.
*  It's worth it to pay that off.
*  Up your earning potential.
*  For sure.
*  Jessa Reed.
*  Do you know who Jessa Reed is?
*  No.
*  You know her.
*  Yeah.
*  She got one of the best stories that's been on Ari's show.
*  Comic?
*  Comic.
*  Addicted to meth.
*  She found out that when you pee, when you're on meth,
*  that is a percentage of meth in your pee.
*  So she was like liquid gold.
*  Oh, boy.
*  She told the story on Ari's podcast and it's a great story.
*  That's the thing with mushrooms, you know, when you trip balls,
*  if you drink your piss, you'll trip even harder.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of psilocybin goes right through your piss.
*  You can also counterpoint.
*  Have you done this?
*  You can counterpoint.
*  Or just do more mushrooms.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a better move.
*  That's a better move.
*  Counterpoint.
*  Yeah, there she is.
*  So Jessa had all fake teeth because they'd all fallen out from meth.
*  Damn, she's pretty.
*  She's beautiful.
*  And she's fucking hilarious.
*  So she did my podcast and told the story.
*  And just this is what's beautiful about podcasts.
*  Some dentist in Portland was like, yo, I can do it for free.
*  No way.
*  Fleur on.
*  Or she flew up.
*  He did her whole fucking mouth.
*  Wow.
*  I wish I knew that guy's name.
*  I'd give him a shout out.
*  But fucking.
*  Text her.
*  Text her and give that to the shout out.
*  That's cool shit.
*  Yeah, give that to the shout out.
*  That's cool.
*  It's no money out of his pocket.
*  It's his time.
*  And he's like, ah, you know what?
*  You made me laugh for fucking two hours on first podcast.
*  That's cool.
*  That's very cool.
*  I love stories like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do I feel worse when hot girls become addicted to meth?
*  Like, I saw like.
*  Because you see the potential ruin, man.
*  It's just like a fucking great young fighter that gets in the coke and crack.
*  Yeah, you see the potential.
*  Not some little scribing.
*  You know how good her life could be, basically.
*  Right.
*  A fitness influencer just do squats and yoga pants.
*  What?
*  How good is that gig?
*  That's a great gig.
*  What?
*  The fucking.
*  Those gals make a lot of money.
*  The hot influencer.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Where they get paid.
*  There's certain girls that just have.
*  Crazy money.
*  I got some style and I'm cute.
*  Here's the thing, though.
*  They are changing what a hot ass looks like.
*  Who?
*  Who?
*  Standards.
*  On Instagram because of these influence.
*  And everyone's trying to keep up with that.
*  Oh, my God.
*  There's certain girls that are just in the gym every fucking day,
*  trying to figure out new ways to make their ass pop.
*  In the fight?
*  Yeah.
*  And what is a good ass now?
*  I mean, in the 70s, all you had to do was just like be there.
*  Not be huge.
*  Yeah, but like asses didn't mean anything.
*  You should have seen these fucking.
*  Something happen to people.
*  Reggaeton girls in Colombia with their asses.
*  What's that word?
*  Reggaeton.
*  What does that mean?
*  It's like a type of music.
*  Oh, like reggae?
*  No, reggaeton.
*  Reggaeton?
*  Yeah.
*  Have you heard that?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I was just going to ask.
*  35 years old.
*  35 years old.
*  It's fucking old people do it there.
*  Brady Smith.
*  Brady Smith, DDS.
*  Hollad, Brady Smith.
*  Oh, how did you do that?
*  Because Jamie's a wizard.
*  God damn.
*  Savior of just a smile.
*  Thank you, Brady Smith.
*  Where does he live?
*  We should post his.
*  Yeah.
*  Does he live in Portland?
*  Docs him.
*  Docs that motherfucker.
*  Where does he live?
*  Portland.
*  Brady Smith from Portland.
*  Folks, if you listen to this and you need some dental work done, go to that guy.
*  Look, he's a handsome fella.
*  What a fucking good guy.
*  Yeah.
*  What a good guy.
*  He's got a podcast?
*  Shout out to his podcast.
*  Called Drilled.
*  What's it called?
*  It's called Drilled.
*  It's called Drilled?
*  Yeah.
*  He does people's teeth and stuff.
*  That must be the most boring podcast of all time.
*  That is hilarious.
*  He does a podcast one.
*  He gets them fucked up on laughing gas.
*  He does a podcast.
*  He does a podcast that just makes you want to kill yourself.
*  That is hilarious.
*  I got to check out his fucking podcast.
*  While he was operating on them.
*  So they're like, what do you do for fun when you're like...
*  If you go back to when asses didn't mean anything, what was the shift?
*  Was it Sir Mix-A-Lot?
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Daisy Dukes, right?
*  No, no, no.
*  Those were legs.
*  She had great legs, but Kathryn Bach did not have an ass.
*  When I heard Baby Got Back, this is how white I am, I was like,
*  you like big ass...
*  It was so foreign to me.
*  I was like, I like big butts and I cannot lie.
*  Yeah, me too.
*  I was like, what the fuck?
*  Who the fuck likes that?
*  Well, that just shows you how segregated this country is.
*  Because when that song came out, people would be like, well, black people like that.
*  They would tell you, that's what black people like.
*  And white people like that now.
*  Well, yeah, of course.
*  That's not that long ago.
*  It's not that long ago, but it is.
*  Do you remember this?
*  No.
*  Do you remember this?
*  How long ago was this?
*  Human history.
*  Look, everything else stayed the same.
*  What do girls like?
*  Girls like guys with big muscles, guys that were tall,
*  guys with six packs.
*  It's all the same.
*  Yeah.
*  But what a guy's body is.
*  She would say a guy who's like six foot three with a big chest and big arms and a
*  six pack and a big hog.
*  You call Christina right now and see what she says.
*  She's asleep.
*  Listen, we're not talking about your wives.
*  We're talking about a girl who has no emotional connection to someone.
*  If you asked her, write down on paper.
*  What's attractive?
*  Ryan Reynolds, right?
*  That's what she'd say.
*  Jason Momoa.
*  Some contractor looking dude.
*  It's the same.
*  It was that way in the 70s.
*  It's that way now.
*  The thing that changed with men is asses.
*  Yes.
*  No one was into asses.
*  No, it didn't mean anything.
*  I saw an ass going into Petco yesterday that was fucking insane.
*  And I was like, I never would have been into that as a kid.
*  What are you showing me here, Jamie?
*  Says Jane Fonda brought it up in the 70s.
*  You can't really see it though.
*  It's just from the side.
*  Athletic female butt.
*  She's been to a lot of.
*  That's a trick.
*  She can't see it.
*  Ah, get away.
*  You got to see it standing up.
*  That's a great question.
*  And a fucking Instagram influencer would be ashamed of that butt.
*  They also give credit.
*  They like flat ones in the 60s.
*  Credit to the country of Brazil.
*  Who's the girl?
*  Jen Seltzer?
*  Is that the girl who's got the most insane fucking ass on Instagram?
*  I know what you're talking about.
*  She's one of them.
*  But there's no one girl anymore.
*  There's so many.
*  There's ass implants now.
*  Yeah, that's a mess.
*  It looks weird.
*  Do you remember?
*  Girls are getting cancer from that.
*  Implants no good.
*  Do you remember on MTV they had a show called True Life?
*  And there was a guy that got calf implants.
*  Do you remember that by any chance?
*  No.
*  I remember that so vividly.
*  I do remember that from True Life.
*  And I was like, what a fucking.
*  Like how?
*  Didn't you always, as someone who's never had all those muscles,
*  I would always seek like those guys and be like, I'd rather not have it than do with this part.
*  Like I saw that as such a pathetic thing to do.
*  You have to have a foreign body.
*  Yeah.
*  That's sticking inside of you.
*  This the real problem with that is the same thing that happens to some women when they
*  get breast implants, they get cancer.
*  Girls are getting that in their ass now.
*  There's new instances of ass cancer that are directly caused by these ass implants.
*  The ass implants.
*  I mean, that is obviously probably the more important
*  statistic they are.
*  I think that I don't think they look good.
*  You get ass cancer.
*  It's crazy.
*  Imagine getting ass cancer because you're too lazy to do squats.
*  But don't you find that like a, yeah, because it is, but if you don't you find it like almost
*  more permissible, forgivable in a way to say like this woman's getting breast implants.
*  You go like, okay.
*  But like if a guy's like, oh, I got peck implants.
*  And just fucking push on.
*  I know a dude who had peck implants.
*  He had a bunch of stuff done.
*  I know a guy who got peck implants.
*  And you know what I did when I saw him?
*  Something that I never do, which is pat him on the chest.
*  And I didn't know he had surgery the day before.
*  And I was like, good to see.
*  He was like, basically almost started weeping.
*  And that's the only reason he, no one wants to confess that.
*  The guy that I know killed himself.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, he was getting a bunch of plastic surgery.
*  I'm just killing himself.
*  This guy should.
*  He's the fucking.
*  You know Tommy Morrison got peck implants?
*  Did he really?
*  Oh my god dude, it's gross.
*  Well, Tommy Morrison went off the deep end.
*  Like this is after he turned HIV positive.
*  He's doing all kinds of crazy drugs.
*  And he got peck implants and they were preposterous.
*  Jamie, I know you're on this.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at that.
*  That's him after we want to fight HIV positive with peck implants.
*  That looks horrible.
*  Yeah, but this is even worse pictures.
*  But look at the picture of him when he didn't have them.
*  Right there, right?
*  No, he probably had them there.
*  Yeah, those are peck implants.
*  That's when he didn't have them.
*  That's when he fought George Foreman.
*  He was fucking jacked when he was young.
*  I mean, he looked fantastic.
*  He punched George Foreman.
*  Did he win that fight?
*  No.
*  Yes, he did.
*  He beat George Foreman.
*  Wow.
*  George Foreman was 74.
*  George Foreman was like 55.
*  Dude, he was still mercing people.
*  He won a decision over George Foreman, which is a substantial victory.
*  He's like the chicken of boxing.
*  What do you mean?
*  Remember chicken?
*  The comic?
*  Yeah.
*  No, he beat some good guys.
*  He killed himself, right?
*  He beat Razor Ruddock.
*  Yes, he did.
*  He beat Razor Ruddock.
*  He stopped him, dropped him with a big left hook.
*  Tom DeMars had a nasty left hook.
*  He just couldn't win the big fight, and he got destroyed by Ray Mercer after Rocky.
*  Look at that picture of him after he got arrested.
*  See that picture right next to your cursor?
*  Above that, Jamie, right there.
*  That's him on the right-hand side, HIV positive, all fucked up after he got arrested.
*  Oh my God.
*  Did he ever get AIDS?
*  He looked like he was...
*  He died.
*  I think he died of AIDS.
*  But that was him.
*  Oh my God.
*  He was falling apart.
*  His life was over.
*  I mean, he would just...
*  44?
*  Yeah, yeah, he died real young.
*  Wow.
*  And that was him at 44.
*  He looks like a seven-year-old man.
*  He died at 44?
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  He was not doing good, man.
*  Damn, dude.
*  He got addicted to all kinds of drugs, and his health fell apart.
*  It was not good.
*  I wish someone would do a documentary on chicken.
*  He got famous.
*  He should.
*  I mean, Tommy Morrison got famous.
*  He was a good boxer, like a really good boxer, and then he got famous from that Rocky movie,
*  and then his whole life fell apart.
*  He was so good in that movie.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, I remember we were in high school when that movie was out,
*  and we were standing up in the aisles, like going, come on, come on, Rock!
*  It was a good fucking movie.
*  It was a good boxing movie.
*  He was a good actor in it.
*  There's always a thing, though, right, of like if a white boxer is decent,
*  there's like a great white hope kind of factor to it.
*  Except Russians.
*  See, Vadyvr Klitschko held the title forever, and no one gave a fuck.
*  Right.
*  Like he's not American.
*  Well, he wasn't American, and also he had kind of a boring style.
*  But that's him in the movie.
*  But in real life, he was a very good boxer up until the time that he did that Rocky movie.
*  But I think it was, I think Pussy was just like,
*  they were putting Pussy in slingshots and just shooting it at him.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he was a handsome guy.
*  He was a movie star, and people thought that he was going to be the next
*  heavyweight champion in the world.
*  And did you ever see the Ray Mercer fight?
*  Oh, cue that up, because it's one of the most brutal knockouts.
*  Just cue up Ray Mercer, KO's, Tommy Morrison.
*  It is fucking horrible.
*  I mean, it is one of the worst, because he gets tangled in the ropes.
*  I was watching with my friend Kevin, we were at a bar and we were watching it.
*  And just go to the part where he gets KO'd.
*  Go to the end.
*  It's fucking rough, man.
*  He gets caught.
*  Is he like, sits, eats?
*  He gets, before that, before that, way before that.
*  He gets, yeah, so he gets, yeah, there it is.
*  Before, just go right before this.
*  So Ray Mercer, he started getting tired, and Ray Mercer catches him in the corner.
*  He unloads on him, and Tommy Morrison's arms get tangled in the ropes, so he can't go down.
*  Like, look at this.
*  See, he's tangled in the ropes.
*  Oh, fuck.
*  Bro, I mean, it was one of the worst KO's I ever remember seeing.
*  Look at that.
*  I mean, Ray Mercer was a murderous puncher.
*  He was an Olympic gold medalist.
*  Damn, late stoppage.
*  Whoa, yeah.
*  The referee was scared to get in there.
*  That's the 90s for you, huh?
*  The referee was scared to get in there.
*  And Ray Mercer was, back then, top flight.
*  Like no one's cheering.
*  Ray Mercer, the one who fought the white MMA guy?
*  Yeah, Tim Sylvia KO'd him with one punch.
*  And that was a rough one, too, because they were supposed to have a boxing match,
*  and Tim Sylvia kicked his leg.
*  Yeah, they both agreed, though.
*  Like, it's MMA, but we're not going to kick.
*  This is why the commission wouldn't allow it to be a boxing match,
*  because Ray Mercer was a world champion in Olympic gold medals,
*  and Tim Sylvia did not have an MMA fight, or did not have a boxing fight.
*  But he was, you know, a very high-level MMA fighter.
*  But he was past his prime.
*  So they decided to have, they called it an MMA fight.
*  Ray Mercer was, I think, 40.
*  They had a gentleman's agreement.
*  I think Ray Mercer was 46 at the time.
*  He sees the gentleman's agreement.
*  Look at the look on his face, like, come on, man.
*  You just said we're not going to do that.
*  But watch this.
*  Watch him setting this up.
*  Bang!
*  And then he gets on top of it and goes, oh, I've never been able to do this before.
*  Yeah.
*  A punch when someone's down.
*  Holy shit.
*  The whole fight takes a few seconds.
*  Look at this.
*  That is a hammer of a punch.
*  That's a slow fall.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, it was already way past Tim Sylvia's prime.
*  But Tim Sylvia, when he was young, he was a fucking animal.
*  He was the one that let his arm get broken.
*  Yes.
*  I remember watching that.
*  He wanted to keep fighting.
*  Frank Mir broke his arm.
*  I remember one of my first fights I ever went to.
*  And it was when you could just kind of move up until people sat in the front.
*  You were allowed to just sit there, you know, like a baseball game.
*  And then Tim Sylvia was there.
*  And Tate was there with me.
*  And he said hi to him.
*  And he was wearing his belt.
*  And it might be my first ever fight.
*  And he had a championship belt.
*  And I was like, later to Tate, I was like, are they supposed
*  to like wear their belts out?
*  And he goes, no, he just does that.
*  Tim Sylvia wore that belt everywhere.
*  He wore his gloves.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  He's the heavyweight champ of the world.
*  Just wears his belt as his belt.
*  Hey, he, look, man, when you're the heavyweight champ of the world,
*  you can do whatever the fuck you want.
*  You want to bring that thing everywhere?
*  Go ahead, bring it everywhere.
*  That would be an interesting book, Ari, is to hear maybe you and like the group that,
*  you know, Joe's experience with MMA has been so different.
*  But I would love to hear an outsider's view as an insider on the growth of MMA.
*  How it was, but then-
*  UFC.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you were going, you guys were going to fights.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Early days.
*  It was barbaric.
*  You saw some early fights, right?
*  Yeah.
*  How many fights you think you've been to?
*  30, 50.
*  Easy.
*  He's been to fights in other countries.
*  Australia, Brazil, fucking everywhere.
*  Everywhere.
*  Where we started going, there was, the weigh-ins was just the fight camps.
*  It was just the people who were with the fighters and then like 10 fans.
*  Yeah.
*  I would do the, I would announce the weigh-ins.
*  There was no one there.
*  I went to a weigh-in that fucking 10, 12,000 people went to.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I forget which one it was.
*  It changed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, when did it change?
*  I don't know.
*  It's been doing it this long.
*  It's been gradual.
*  2005 is really when everything shifted.
*  Wait, if I, if we go to that McGregor fight, can I go see like a weigh-in and stuff?
*  See everything, man.
*  Come with me.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll bring you back to age everywhere.
*  I've never been to, I feel like someone said, you know a lot about MMA.
*  I go, I know a lot of names.
*  I know like, I know, I know everything it seems like, but it's never been to a fight.
*  Never.
*  Oh, they're fun.
*  That's crazy.
*  You should take an edible.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, it's six hours.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Six hours.
*  That's me.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, this is the best one.
*  This is Ari and Duncan making out because they knew the cameras on them.
*  Watch this.
*  Bing.
*  Here we go.
*  Look at them wipe their faces.
*  Yeah.
*  I never been to one and I went one not knowing what to expect at all.
*  It's fun.
*  Being there definitely is an experience.
*  It's not completely different.
*  My favorite part always is when they play the top, the who song between the prelims and the way.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They play the thing is about a fight is, is that like a fight is inherently, you know,
*  exciting, but the energy of those arenas makes it.
*  Did you go with me to the one in Toronto where it was 55,000?
*  Were you with that one?
*  The craziest ones I ever went to was Rio and Columbus.
*  Columbus is when Tim Sylvia fought Captain America.
*  Oh, and he fought Randy.
*  That's right.
*  No one thought Randy would win and then he won every round.
*  Early in the round.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's with the energy.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You'll go.
*  I can't go because I'll be in Hawaii, Oahu, Maui and Kauai.
*  You doing gigs out there?
*  17, 19.
*  AriShipure.com.
*  AriShipure.com.
*  Yeah.
*  They're all there.
*  Ari the Great.
*  Yeah.
*  It's right after New Orleans and Atlanta.
*  Are you doing the Blue Note?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great club.
*  Blue Note.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I'd say I love.
*  Man, I would go back and do that.
*  You're in Hawaii.
*  Where's Blue Note?
*  Is it in Hawaii?
*  I mean, in Maui?
*  It's in Oahu.
*  Honolulu.
*  Proper.
*  Honolulu?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great club.
*  I have never done get, every time I go to Hawaii, I just get drunk and lay on the beach.
*  It's the best.
*  By the way, I cannot envision that.
*  I bet your version of that's different than my version of that.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean, I'm conscious.
*  I don't throw up.
*  Do you go for a run early in the morning so you can earn your buzz?
*  100%.
*  Nobody tries to pour water on them to save them and drag them back into the water.
*  I hit the gym every day.
*  You never watch a woman get hit in the head by a coconut and go, shut the fuck up.
*  You know what I was thinking yesterday in Columbia?
*  Because I saw a coconut tree.
*  You know how they say more people die get hit in the head by coconuts than-
*  Oh yeah.
*  150 people die every year.
*  That's not true.
*  No, 100%.
*  Yes it is.
*  150 people die.
*  I saw a woman get hit on the fucking head by a coconut.
*  What?
*  What did they say?
*  Oh, is that is more than what, Dex?
*  Marijuana.
*  No, no one does marijuana.
*  More than straight people getting AIDS, I think.
*  More people die from aspirin than coconuts.
*  3,000 people in the United States every year from aspirin.
*  Aspirin?
*  Yeah. 150 people die.
*  This legend gained momentum after 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks.
*  Yeah.
*  This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of shark cause deaths per
*  year, which is around five.
*  Yeah, but nobody ever lost an arm to a coconut.
*  I'd rather lose an arm than be dead from a coconut.
*  Hang on.
*  Can I pivot this conversation and say, can we do a mid-year, sober October, mid-year,
*  and do the surfing challenge?
*  The surfing challenge, what we need to do is go to Kelly Slater's place
*  and do the indoor shit.
*  Did you see his pipeline wave?
*  Yeah, it's dope.
*  Fucking-
*  Apparently there's one in Waco that's really crazy.
*  My friend Kenny Fong, he owns Darkside Motoring in Chatsworth.
*  Shout out to Kenny.
*  He went to, he fucking flew into Waco, Texas with their surfboards and people look at him
*  like, what the fuck are y'all doing here?
*  Chipping Joanna.
*  Waco apparently has a giant indoor surf joint, just like Kelly's place.
*  Yeah.
*  Wait, so there's Kelly's place.
*  Hey, look at this.
*  This is fucking bananas, man.
*  That's an indoor.
*  They should have rubber sharks that come in every once in a while.
*  Well, I mean, not indoors, obviously.
*  It's manufactured, right?
*  Wait, so is Kelly's place out here?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It's like two hours from here.
*  Fresno.
*  Fresno, yeah.
*  Dude, Kelly did a 24-7 on HBO for Kelly Slater for him competing in this year's Triple Crown.
*  Pipe.
*  And it was fucking so, it makes you-
*  I watched it and I was like, dude, I just-
*  Well, it's not fake, it's generated by man, but it's a real water wave.
*  And you can learn how to surf on these motherfuckers.
*  Obviously it's going to be so uniform.
*  Dude, that's so much easier because you don't have to wait to get a wave.
*  You don't have to learn where to sit on the fucking-
*  Right.
*  Like, dude, I'm telling you, man, that 24-7 for Kelly Slater, everyone's got to watch it.
*  It's so good.
*  That guy is such a- I've known of him since I was probably-
*  A kid, man.
*  I would say he got 11 years old.
*  Dude, we said the celebrity of living where I lived was that Kelly-
*  Kelly Slater.
*  Would surf at Sebastian Inlet.
*  Yeah, Monster Hole, Monster Hole.
*  So I was in Vero and Sebastian's north of Vero and they're like,
*  Kelly Slater surfs at Sebastian.
*  I don't even know if it's true.
*  He put Coco Beach on the map.
*  I mean, Ron John was at a Coco Beach, but you knew Kelly Slater was Coco Beach.
*  Dude, I went to surf at Coco Beach and I was like, you go out in the lineup
*  and you're just looking around when you're a kid going, is Kelly Slater going to be here?
*  I knew his name when I was fucking 12, 13.
*  There's a certain celebrity that comes with being a wave rider, like a badass wave rider.
*  It's a different kind of celebrity.
*  It's like, that dude's a savage.
*  And he was not in Saved by the Bell?
*  No, that's different Slater.
*  He was in Baywatch though.
*  That's Mario Lopez, bro.
*  Oh, different guy.
*  I'm telling you, man.
*  I'm getting it now.
*  Kelly Slater, the wave, he caught a pipeline.
*  Can you pull that up?
*  The pipeline, he just caught a wave of pipeline.
*  Did you see that?
*  Did you see that wave?
*  No, I didn't.
*  You got to pull this up.
*  He's an amazing fucking athlete for sure.
*  And I love that he's competitive.
*  Yeah.
*  I love that.
*  What do you mean?
*  Of course he's an amazing world champion.
*  I know, but people squash that shit and they don't say it publicly.
*  He was on your podcast and he was talking about,
*  I used to get obsessed with ping pong.
*  Oh, sure.
*  Like, I could lift.
*  Dude, is this the wave?
*  I don't know.
*  And he is the older guy too, which is crazy.
*  Like, what year did they have to stop doing this?
*  Like, Kelly's in his 40s, right?
*  Gotta be.
*  Gotta be.
*  He's got to be 47.
*  He's got to be one of the eighth pipe masters.
*  May have retired?
*  If he was going to win, I think he was going to definitely retire.
*  He's 47 years old.
*  Perfect 10.
*  Go down.
*  47?
*  Perfect 10.
*  That's incredible.
*  Go to perfect 10.
*  Kelly Slater, perfect 10.
*  This wave, Joe is like...
*  Where do you see this?
*  Perfect 10 of pipeline.
*  This wave is fucking...
*  Is that it right there?
*  It's got it.
*  Wow.
*  I hope so.
*  It's twice his height, three times his height.
*  Christ.
*  The drop-in's fucking sick and it closes out on him.
*  Look at that.
*  That's crazy.
*  Look at this.
*  And you're like, wait...
*  So he's threw it while it's closing on top of him and hit him in the face.
*  Oh my God.
*  I don't know.
*  That's bonkers, man.
*  Do you think it is...
*  Do you think that that feeling right there...
*  Perfect show where you get a standing ovation.
*  Look at that.
*  Do you ever get...
*  It's hitting him in the face as he's trying to stay on board.
*  What kind of fucking balance...
*  Watch this water.
*  Yeah, he knows it.
*  He's like, if I could just get through here, I've got it.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  Right here.
*  Like this.
*  I gotta do my last joke.
*  It's hitting him in the face.
*  He still hangs in there.
*  But look at this part.
*  Look at this feeling he's got.
*  Right?
*  Yes.
*  I've had that coming off stage before, but I can't be like that.
*  It can't be like that.
*  He's also 47 and still able to do this, which is incredible because
*  you gotta think that for high level athletics like this, that is...
*  He's competing against 22 year olds for sure.
*  That's about as high as you get.
*  And do you think he knows halfway through this, like, oh, this is on the pace right now for perfection?
*  Dude, you gotta see this 24-7 because he talks about getting out in the lineup and going,
*  sometimes the waves just don't show up.
*  You can't change that.
*  And then sometimes you go, fuck it, I gotta roll the dice.
*  This looks like a shit wave and it may be...
*  Fuck me over, but I'm gonna...
*  This is obviously the reminder words.
*  And then he's like, I'm gonna do it.
*  And on this thing, he pulls out like a fucking nine on a wave and everyone's like, what the fuck?
*  He's still got it.
*  But it's really crazy, man.
*  That wave, I saw that because I just watched that thing.
*  And Andrew Schultz is a big surfer.
*  Schultz is a surfer?
*  Hardcore, bro.
*  He went to...
*  He lives in New York.
*  They have Long Beach people surfing Long Beach.
*  And he moved out to LA to go to school up at Santa Barbara
*  to go surfing.
*  That was his goal.
*  He was like, I'll surf every day.
*  And then he got out there and was like, fuck this.
*  I'm gonna get into comedy.
*  Hot chicks.
*  Yeah, I'm gonna fucking...
*  Hot chicks, nice weather.
*  You think Jimmy Kelly Slater gets the perfect 10 and all his competition is like 22-year-old guys.
*  And they're like, you're a legend, man.
*  You're a legend.
*  He's like, you should see the fucking three girls I fucked this morning.
*  All right, man.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  He still is doing crazy shit.
*  He's fucking banging models.
*  Is he?
*  Oh, bro.
*  For sure.
*  No, he's got a chick.
*  He's got a chick.
*  Beautiful chick.
*  Well, yeah.
*  I've been before her.
*  But you should have seen Kelly Slater with hair.
*  Have you ever seen Kelly Slater with hair?
*  Is he more handsome?
*  Oh, bro.
*  Pull up a picture of fuck boy.
*  Young fuck boy Kelly Slater.
*  Like not fuck boy in a good way, you know?
*  Like he was gorgeous.
*  This is the part of the podcast that he's not gonna enjoy.
*  I didn't mean fuck boy in a bad way.
*  He was like enjoying us playing the video.
*  Look at this dude.
*  Look at young Kelly Slater with hair.
*  Handsome.
*  Are you shitting me?
*  This is movie star looks.
*  That's the problem.
*  Look at that fucking picture.
*  It's amazing when you're that handsome that you get anything done.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  That's a problem with really, really good looking guys.
*  They're slaying so much.
*  Oh, he was in Baywatch.
*  He was.
*  Kelly Slater with hair might be...
*  Look at that handsome bastard with Pamela Anderson back when she was Pamela Anderson.
*  Kapow before she was fucking Julian Assange in an embassy somewhere.
*  You think they were boning?
*  Woo!
*  For sure.
*  Why would she fly all the way over there and not fuck him?
*  Oh, she did?
*  You ever see her on The View just laying down the fucking truth to those ladies?
*  And they treated her like a model and she was like,
*  no, no, I've actually researched a bunch of information I like to talk about.
*  Damn.
*  It was pretty fucking cool.
*  Well, the view.
*  They should do a fantasy camp of chicks you could fuck.
*  The view is this, but they talk about like serious shit and people take them seriously.
*  Take them real seriously.
*  Yeah, but there's two more and they're cackling over each other and yelling at each other
*  and telling each other to calm down.
*  I think I'm one of those two.
*  Here's the thing is though, they're not even friends.
*  That's what's weird about that show that'll never work.
*  It's worked.
*  No, but it doesn't really.
*  The conversations are gross.
*  And they talk over each other.
*  He says they fight, right?
*  They had a big fight that was probably fighting.
*  But like a big one.
*  But they always do it.
*  They have like the blonde lady who's a Republican.
*  I mean, how many times have they tried that?
*  The football player's wife.
*  Elizabeth Hasselhoff guy.
*  Hasselbeck.
*  I was thinking of the other one.
*  McCain.
*  McCain girl.
*  Yeah, Meghan McCain now.
*  That's the new one.
*  They always have the blonde.
*  And then Whoopi.
*  They always have like before it was Whoopi.
*  Was Whoopi always there?
*  They had Barbara Walters was there.
*  They had Rosie O'Donnell.
*  Rosie O'Donnell was there for a long time.
*  She would battle with the Hasselhoffers.
*  It's funny to think of what goes into producing the view.
*  And like what it is, right?
*  It's people talking.
*  But I'm saying you think of like the production, the people, the makeup, the grips, the sound people.
*  The producers taking notes.
*  And then like you're doing the same.
*  Like this is the same thing.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like the conversation is happening.
*  But without all the nonsense.
*  Yeah, without any nonsense.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the difference between TV and this.
*  Well, I bet that show would be better if you just let them just talk.
*  Definitely would be.
*  And there's no commercials.
*  It'd also be more popular.
*  Probably.
*  Let's put it.
*  How popular is it?
*  It's been on for a long time.
*  What do you think like it gets on an average day?
*  I think more than like sitcoms.
*  Like a couple million views?
*  No, more.
*  I think it's like all these housewives at home with nothing to do with their dumb boring lives.
*  Five million views probably.
*  I'm guessing.
*  Five million viewers.
*  I'd say 20.
*  Let's do this.
*  20?
*  Fuck it.
*  That's my guess.
*  No, it's not 20.
*  Let's flip it the other way.
*  Okay.
*  100 million.
*  How about this?
*  Oh, God.
*  What could you add from what they have, their business model that would increase, would better your show?
*  Zero.
*  I know one.
*  I know one.
*  Maybe they could put makeup on my head so I wouldn't be so shiny.
*  Do you know the viewers?
*  Do you find it or no?
*  This is the last month they averaged about 2.6 million.
*  So I guess that's per show.
*  Per show.
*  Probably.
*  The difference is that how many people are fans and how many people are just flipping through channels.
*  Because there's nothing else on.
*  I've seen episodes of The View.
*  I've watched it.
*  I bet you have.
*  I definitely have.
*  Like when Norm was on.
*  Did you see when Norm was on?
*  I watched it when Donald Trump's video was on.
*  That was the best.
*  That was the best episode of The View?
*  What did Norm do with him?
*  Norm McDonnell says.
*  Is the greatest.
*  Norm at one point says, I've never had consensual sex with a woman.
*  Just see what they do.
*  This is the-
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  He just got tripped up in his words and he was on this apology tour and he was like-
*  It was right as, it said the stage, it's right as his Netflix show is about to air
*  and he gets in big trouble because he's on Stern.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Hold on.
*  Start it over.
*  He defends Louis first.
*  Okay.
*  And then Rosanne.
*  And then and then and then Rosanne.
*  Then he goes on Stern.
*  And when he's Stern, and when he's on Stern, instead of saying like,
*  like you'd have to be retarded to like to laugh at this or to think this,
*  he'd be like, you'd have to have Down syndrome.
*  So he keeps saying-
*  He thinks that's better because he thinks Down syndrome is okay to say,
*  but retarded is bad because it's the R word.
*  Right, right, right.
*  So he's like-
*  So he just, he pinned-
*  So he says it a bunch.
*  And they're about to launch the show.
*  So of course, like, you know, everybody involved is like panicking.
*  Like you need to make it clear.
*  You have a new show launching.
*  You got it.
*  You got it.
*  So he goes on the view and he's like, yeah, he's like, yeah.
*  And he is, you can see, you can mute this and watch this.
*  He is eating mints, like as he, and popping them in his mouth.
*  Joe, he's literally eating mints.
*  And shaking them in his hand.
*  He's like, yeah, I feel real bad about that.
*  And he's like, why would I talk about Louis?
*  I've never even had consensual sex with a girl.
*  And they're like, no, I've never had consensual sex with a girl.
*  He goes, why would I?
*  And they're like, no, I think you're misspeaking, Norm.
*  And then you see him, like you're on his day time.
*  He's like, he's like, yeah, so I feel real bad about that.
*  He's a fucking wild man.
*  He is the best.
*  Do you remember-
*  He's such a wild man.
*  I was just talking to Adam about this.
*  Do you remember the time you came?
*  We can't tell the full story because I think Norm wouldn't be comfortable with it.
*  But do you remember the time right before the election
*  where you had a vape pen that was really strong and Norm came back?
*  Yes.
*  Do you remember what he said to us?
*  No, what did he say?
*  I wish I could say it out loud.
*  Okay.
*  It was like, it was the funniest fucked up.
*  He was not ready.
*  I got him fucked up.
*  I've smoked weed before.
*  Right before this?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, guys like that don't smoke weed a lot.
*  They just do it occasionally.
*  They think they remember what weed is.
*  Right.
*  This weed that they're fucking with today is a different animal.
*  It's just, it's too in the pen.
*  So innocuous.
*  It's just vaporizing.
*  But it was, it was hash oil in the pen.
*  It was fucking, it was nuclear.
*  I smoked with him one time in a parking lot in Irvine.
*  Right before I was with Ryan Sickler.
*  Ryan always has good weed.
*  And we met Norm and we were about to go in and he smoked.
*  Dude, he's like such a comfortable comic like with any, like, you know,
*  he doesn't need like handing some time alone to get my mind right before this.
*  That we're in the parking lot.
*  He takes a fucking monster hit of strong weed and he starts coughing,
*  like coughing enough to make like, you know, like a tear come where you're like,
*  and then we walk into the Irvine improv and they're announcing him.
*  He just walks on stage and he just starts talking about the soda he's drinking
*  and killing with it.
*  Like just off the top of his head, just totally comfortable.
*  He's one of the funniest guys ever.
*  Him and Stan Hup changed the way I did this next special.
*  This next special was like, like, because I love those guys that grow,
*  you know, that when you see them, it's not, they're not doing their like,
*  there's nothing wrong with it, but like doing the exact same type of stuff.
*  They did in the last one.
*  They're just changing the names a little bit.
*  Right.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  And I looked at, I called Stan hope, maybe one of the most mind bending days of Stan.
*  Just when you said that smell thing where your brain goes, wait, what the fuck?
*  I called Stan hope one day and he was like, hey, what are you doing?
*  He was like, uh, drinking a vodka and grape suit, trying to grape grape juice,
*  grapefruit juice, trying to write a knock knock joke.
*  I was like, what?
*  He's like, yeah, I'm thinking of funny goofs, you know, trying to write a knock
*  knock joke.
*  We gotta be as funny as those guys, right?
*  I was like, yeah.
*  And he goes, so we could write one, couldn't we?
*  He was like, let me tell you what I got.
*  And he's like, reads a couple of knock knock jokes.
*  And I was like, yeah, why the fuck aren't we fucking with the format?
*  And then norm, I see norm and norm has the best joke.
*  I'm going to tell you the joke is that great.
*  It's the best joke.
*  Is he still doing it?
*  No, no.
*  Norm, this, this for me was like, this was like, why aren't we going?
*  Why aren't we, why aren't we sometimes taking a step back to take a step forward?
*  Right.
*  Norm has a joke.
*  He goes, uh, I got a new neighbor.
*  I see the neighbor and I said, uh, hey neighbor, what do you do for a living?
*  Neighbor says, uh, norm, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a professor of logic down at the university
*  to science.
*  And norm says, what's that?
*  He goes, well, norm, it's hard for me to explain.
*  It's easier to me to just show you what I do.
*  Norm, do you have a dog house?
*  And norm goes, I do.
*  And he goes, well, then you must have a dog logically.
*  He goes, I do have a dog.
*  And he goes, all right.
*  And if you have a dog, logic, I can assume you must have a child.
*  Do you have a child, norm?
*  And he goes, I do have a child.
*  And if you have a child logically, I can assume you must be married to a woman.
*  Are you married to a woman, norm?
*  And he goes, I am.
*  It was norm.
*  Then logically, I can assume you're a straight white male.
*  And norm goes, wow, that's amazing.
*  So the next day norm's down at a bus stop having a cigarette.
*  He sees another one of his neighbors and neighbors says, norm, did you meet the new neighbor?
*  He goes, yeah, I did.
*  He goes, what's he do for a living?
*  He goes, he's a professor of logic down at the university of science.
*  He goes, what is that?
*  He goes, well, it's hard for me to explain as much as you're for me to show.
*  Yeah.
*  Norm goes, hey, do you have a dog house?
*  He goes, no.
*  And he goes, well, then you must be a faggot.
*  Why?
*  What like, like, it's a great joke.
*  Why are we like, we're all funny.
*  Like, why can't we?
*  Because that's a problematic word and it's banned.
*  He's such a piece of shit.
*  You're like, why can't we say it?
*  I can't make jokes like that.
*  Oh, it was, dude, it's like one of the, it's a great joke, but like,
*  though that old school joke writing, we all stepped away from, but like,
*  what if we could tether ourselves to it a tad bit and what we're doing now.
*  Norman does that.
*  Mark Norman does jokes like that.
*  Norman does, but like stand up going, I'm writing knock, knock jokes,
*  just for like a writing exercise.
*  Where you go, what if you, what if you just wrote like a banger, knock, knock joke or like,
*  that's the thing is you can do it.
*  You can do it.
*  Spend time writing.
*  For the, yeah, this special I wrote something like that.
*  What are your specials coming out?
*  I can't say it yet, but I know.
*  Well, you can't say it yet, but you know.
*  They just say don't bother, but you can still say it.
*  They just tell you.
*  They tell you.
*  It's interesting.
*  I wonder if that hurts.
*  They say don't waste your time.
*  How does that hurt?
*  Promoting it ahead of time, but you can still promote it ahead of time.
*  I would hate to say it.
*  You know what you can say?
*  I think actually, no, I think they actually do request at Netflix
*  that you don't say it the time.
*  So people can't get like souped up for it.
*  They asked me.
*  They want to be the ones that tell.
*  That comes with paying a lot of money.
*  I'm going big for this special.
*  Tommy knows I got big plans.
*  Your videos.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I'm going to do something different.
*  Are you saying something that you can't say?
*  Yeah.
*  So what the fuck is this?
*  Yeah.
*  Let's change subjects.
*  This is nonsense.
*  You're hurting people's feelings at home.
*  You are going to do something.
*  But I think that's what's cool about comedy is like,
*  that's why I've always liked,
*  like, I like guys that go against Graham,
*  but like Burr, I feel like Burr every time does something different,
*  like challenges himself with an act out or something.
*  He does.
*  You know?
*  He does.
*  He always says that.
*  He was like, figure out what you do bad and then just only do that for a while.
*  I didn't do like the back and forth conversation style,
*  but I'm going to work on that in this special and then he'll be in that special.
*  It was so good.
*  I know what you're talking about because I talked to Burr about this too.
*  It's the one with the, with this, when he adopts the two sons.
*  Yeah.
*  It's one of the best.
*  I watched that on my treadmill and my drinking wine in my man cave and I went.
*  Wait a minute.
*  You're drinking wine on the treadmill?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, this is part of the routine.
*  It's called multitasking Joe gets into it.
*  It saves your time.
*  Maybe hire a fucking trainer.
*  That one joke.
*  Have you thought about hiring a trainer?
*  No, that one joke is fucking.
*  Is that his last special?
*  No, it's like three specials ago.
*  I think, I think not enough people challenge themselves to get outside the box.
*  I think that in our business, you write, right?
*  But do you sit down and write a little bit?
*  That's not too much.
*  That means no, no, no, no.
*  Because what happens, Joe, is that it becomes, I don't much.
*  It becomes, uh, it becomes too much for you to remember on stage.
*  So what I do is I'll write bullet points of what, of things that pop for me,
*  but to sit in long hand, right?
*  I just, it becomes too much information.
*  I don't remember it.
*  I've been, I've done it a bunch.
*  Your brain doesn't even work like that.
*  No, I get to like a presentational when I do that too.
*  Yeah.
*  I try to recite it as I wrote it instead of just like, just say it.
*  But don't you have any bits that feel like that are so word specific?
*  They feel like you're reciting not in a bad way.
*  Sometimes, especially when I get off the road for a while.
*  And then I try doing it at a club, like a comedy store or the stand or something.
*  And then I like start doing it.
*  I'm like, oh, I'm reciting this instead of like talking to an audience of 40 or 50.
*  Yeah.
*  It feels weird.
*  Small crowd will make you talk to them.
*  The more time you spend in preparation, and this is something that I didn't start doing
*  until about two years ago, actually preparing for shows, like going over notes.
*  And one of the things that I have in the rider in my contract, I write index cards.
*  Yeah.
*  Index cards.
*  I got that from Kevin James.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. I have Kevin James' rider.
*  And your white wine.
*  Yeah. White wine. I took that out.
*  And you also have like all white couches and white flowers in your dressing room.
*  White M&Ms.
*  Only white dryers.
*  Who's the racist now?
*  White limos.
*  No, I think that was a white, that was like an old,
*  J.Lo or something.
*  Yeah. Like a J.Lo thing.
*  Tommy Davidson said white limo has to pick me up and then they picked one of the black
*  fiddle watts.
*  I thought that was.
*  No, that's Eddie Griffin.
*  Oh, really?
*  No, no, I think that was DeRay.
*  You guys are saying those are not the same people?
*  There was, I actually worked at a club once where they were like, there was a somebody here who
*  requested a white, here's the thing. It wasn't like a white limo. They were like a white Yukon.
*  It had to be a specific model vehicle and they did not pick it up and that person
*  chose to wait at the airport.
*  That's what I heard was Tommy Davidson's story. I heard like that.
*  I love those people who were like, I put these crazy things in my writers to make sure they're
*  reading it, but that's the only thing they put in their writer.
*  Is that thing.
*  So it's like, you're not putting in for that. You want that thing.
*  You want that thing. Just say it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's in the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.
*  You got to put things in your writer or people don't take you seriously.
*  But I don't think, I mean, I don't know anybody who's legit that has wacky things in their
*  writer.
*  Do you remember when they asked you guys like, do you want a writer? And you're like a writer?
*  Yeah.
*  And then like, I remember, it was like, you've got to get something.
*  If you're a performer and you work a venue, you have the option to like basically make requests
*  of things you want in your green room so that you feel happy and comfortable to perform.
*  But at first it was like, make sure it's some water, I guess backstage.
*  I got water.
*  I can just go to the front and get it.
*  Buffalo trays, whiskey, Cabernet, meat tray, fruit.
*  Meat tray is key.
*  I got throat coat tea, gummy bears.
*  Gummy bears.
*  Man.
*  I have a meat and cheese plate, a veggie plate, water, both flat and still, coffee, tea.
*  And that's, you know, what all I have.
*  Standard.
*  It's pretty standard. I mean, it's insane when you see like usually what musicians can
*  really drive it up.
*  Chappelle has all red lights in his dressing room.
*  That's kind of cool though.
*  I'll tell you what, when you're in a cool lit room.
*  Unless you're the guy that's gotta go find fucking red lights.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  But the lighting, the lighting fucking makes a difference, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Like shitty, like over office light, you know, overhead.
*  That fucking sucks.
*  Yeah, it was real bright in the other classroom.
*  Yeah.
*  One time, one time we're in the green room and it was, it was your green room and you
*  invited the ring car girls back just to like hang and stuff.
*  And I was trying to get my head, get ready for a fucking big show and these
*  squawking fucking hot chicks.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, I just sit in the stairwell to fucking collect my thoughts.
*  Do you remember the story I told you about sitting next to a ring card girl one time
*  on a flight home?
*  No.
*  That I was, I, I, this is fucking, I don't know how many years ago.
*  I did a gig with you and then I had a, I had a different flight.
*  And one of the ring card girls was sitting across the aisle from me.
*  And she just went water, water.
*  I was like, people were like turning.
*  Yeah.
*  She goes water.
*  That's right.
*  I remember this.
*  And then the flight attendant came up and they're like, are you saying something?
*  And she was like, water.
*  They're like, would you like some water?
*  She was like, yeah.
*  And then they're like, okay.
*  Like she didn't press a button or say, excuse me.
*  She just said water loudly.
*  Oh my God.
*  Until somebody was like, oh, I guess you want water.
*  Wow.
*  She must've been really hungover.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so hungover.
*  You can't say, can I have please have some water?
*  Just water, water, water.
*  I've done that for my bed before.
*  How many times has she heard water before?
*  A lot.
*  You can't be in the green room with a bunch of people that don't understand what you're
*  going through.
*  One time we did a show.
*  We did this fucking end of the world show at the, no, no, no.
*  That was the end of the world.
*  That was the 2016 one for the election.
*  We did one for 2012 with Stan Hope and Diaz and honey, honey.
*  We did it at the Wiltern, right?
*  And for whatever reason, the agents all decided it was a party in my fucking green room.
*  They should always do that.
*  Show.
*  I'm talking.
*  That is the bullshit.
*  And they all do it.
*  They all knew that it was in LA.
*  So they all wanted to come.
*  So they came and they were drinking.
*  They do it in Montreal too.
*  And I was like, Hey, I'm getting ready for a show.
*  They were talking so loud.
*  They didn't give a fuck.
*  It's a place to hang.
*  I was in the green room with it.
*  It's like guys.
*  Treat it like it was the green room of a sitcom.
*  Post show.
*  Yeah.
*  Post show.
*  I don't care if a serial killer comes in the green room.
*  You can do whatever you want.
*  Yeah.
*  Pre-show.
*  Yeah.
*  I like a real chill fucking low key vibe.
*  Me too.
*  And there's nothing crazier than like.
*  How about you on Verde?
*  Strange strangers popping in the overzealous Asian person or.
*  Wait, you meet my friend poachers.
*  You ever get a poacher in there?
*  The fucking like if you have an Asian poacher.
*  We're like, Hey man, how you doing?
*  You like them?
*  Yeah.
*  You're like, I'm so I'm first to the opener.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, have you had an opener that you don't know bring people?
*  You're like, who who are these people?
*  Oh yeah.
*  And you're like, oh yeah.
*  Are you insane?
*  One time I had a guy bring his family.
*  His family, his fam.
*  Like here's the thing.
*  This sounds crazy to say.
*  Was the guy opening for you?
*  Yes.
*  I just ran him on the road.
*  It was a random.
*  No.
*  And it sounds crazy if you're listening or whatever and you're like, what are you talking
*  about?
*  Well, like when you get to the venue and you're going to do a show for most people,
*  they want it like a pretty relaxed vibe pre-show.
*  You're like, you're going to, you're going to perform.
*  You don't, you definitely don't want like more like a strain.
*  I mean, if there's a stranger at most, you're going to be like, hello, and then nice to meet
*  you.
*  And then they're going to leave because they understand you're about to do a thing, right?
*  You just, you want to relax.
*  You're not, you don't necessarily like have to meditate.
*  You're just like, I just want a relaxed atmosphere, right?
*  Like most perform.
*  You got to get your head straight.
*  You're ready to go perform.
*  This guy had kids.
*  No.
*  He had kids in the fucking green room.
*  How many people?
*  It was him, his wife, two small children.
*  And, and then like the promoter.
*  So he was a new comic.
*  He was new, newer.
*  Yeah.
*  And the promoter came by and was like, Hey, how's it going?
*  I was like, it's cool to know we're doing a fucking daycare here today.
*  And he was like, you don't know this.
*  And I go, well, I mean, I don't really know him, but I'm meeting his children right now
*  in the fucking green room of this.
*  I mean, it was bizarre, man.
*  It was very, ask if it was okay.
*  I bring my family.
*  Not at all feel bad.
*  If I know somebody and they're in there and I'm headlining and an opener's in there,
*  I'm like, it's your green room too, because you're also performing.
*  But like, I don't want my friends in there and posing on the opener.
*  Of dude.
*  You know, if I was, if I was opening for you, I would never fucking have the balls to bring.
*  Be like, Oh, he's my friend.
*  Fucking Steve wants to say, Hey, no way, dude.
*  Or a local comic who's not on the show comes by to hang out and just shoot this.
*  It's like, bro, do all that host show, dude.
*  I wrote off a dude that I was friends with for a while for this lat.
*  When I shot the special Cleveland who was like, was it want to just come hang out backstage?
*  And I was like, well, no, it's kind of like, I don't have a really a guest list.
*  It's kind of a closed set because in between shows, I'm getting notes from people that I,
*  that's a huge night.
*  It's a huge fucking night.
*  And I just was like, and he sent me a nasty fucking email about me being a
*  liar about not having a guest list.
*  And I was like, all right, bro, I guess I'll never speak to you again.
*  Because when you're filming, yeah, he was on the show with you.
*  No, no, he was on, wasn't on the show.
*  He just was in town.
*  He wanted to come hang out.
*  He sent you a nasty email saying you're a liar.
*  Because you didn't have a, you said you didn't have a guest list because you wanted to come
*  backstage and hang out.
*  Yeah. He wanted to come to the shows and I was like, Hey man, I it's, I'm in a different spot.
*  Like I've got the people that have been torn with me.
*  I understand that you were doing special.
*  That's not why you're a liar.
*  Is he a comic?
*  Yeah. And I was, I was just like, I was like, it really fucked me up.
*  Cause I was like, and then, and then all of a sudden you're fighting with someone on the
*  day you're special.
*  I was like, if you know what, fuck this man.
*  That's on them.
*  It's like, fuck you for putting me in a position of all my special to have to fight with you.
*  You're an asshole.
*  Yeah.
*  You should go overboard to try to like, hey.
*  You're trying to mentally distract me.
*  Yeah.
*  What you're doing.
*  Dude, it's, it's, it's, it's fuck.
*  I, I don't get me into it because it'll spin me out, but like, man, I'm your, I'm your friend.
*  I'll never, I'll never put you in a situation that where I go like, yo, Joe, can you get my
*  buddy on? I never do that.
*  When people come and go, Hey, give me my own Joe's.
*  I just write them off.
*  That's the way my brain works.
*  I go, if I'm your friend, I'm only your friend.
*  I'm never going to ask shit of you.
*  Like the worst is when you're doing a weekend at a club and some guy asked to do a guest set
*  and you're like, dude, I don't even know you.
*  So just give me a shot.
*  Hey man, you mind if I do a guest set?
*  What bro?
*  When have you ever done that?
*  Did you ever do that when you were coming up?
*  Did you ever go to a national?
*  Not one time in my entire fucking life.
*  Here's how opposite of that.
*  Cause I feel so, I mean, I'm just, I do not want to feel polite.
*  I don't want to pose ever.
*  I actually went to a show one time and was asked if I wanted to do a guest spot.
*  And I was like, that's inappropriate for me to say.
*  I just felt rude being there.
*  Right, right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's people that are entitled versus people that aren't entitled.
*  And I know this from, I know this from knowing Tom as long as I've known him and Ari as well.
*  None of us are the kind of guys that were like, uh, next step.
*  What's the next step in this business to get forward?
*  Who do I step on to get to the next level?
*  I was always like, I want to find my group and I want to be safe.
*  I want to, I want to do what I do and have them be like,
*  Hey man, that was not good.
*  Or this was good as friends.
*  So that I knew that what I was doing as an art form was safe.
*  I never was like, dude, get me on your fucking thing.
*  Get me on your thing.
*  It's.
*  There's so many of those guys out here.
*  There are so many of those guys and there's also people that get upset that you don't use them
*  to open when you use other people that they think are their equal to open.
*  Do you ever get that?
*  But it's just like, yeah, we're not friends with them or like, what?
*  I don't know.
*  I chose somebody.
*  By the way, like not like not getting your shit together to open a big, like if I was,
*  if I was like had the balls to ask you to open one of your shows, I would come to it at least
*  feeling like my 20 is so tight.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So that like when you do it, you're like, this is a good decision.
*  Right.
*  I would be way more nervous opening as a younger comic opening up for you than you would be.
*  Like I would be like dialed in.
*  Of course.
*  I remember asking Dom, not asking Dom.
*  I was open for Pauly in Baltimore and I was home for like Thanksgiving and something.
*  And the week after that in DC, Dom was there and I was saw the lineup was like,
*  nah, I'm never going to ask him.
*  I can't.
*  And then Eleanor told them later, like afterwards.
*  Yeah.
*  I already was there.
*  He was going to ask you, but he was felt embarrassed because I should ask.
*  They told me what a lot of it was like.
*  Yeah.
*  I was going to put him in a position.
*  Yeah.
*  You're imposing.
*  You're imposing.
*  You're polite to think that though.
*  Shout out to, I gotta give a shout out to Mike Birbiglia.
*  When I, one time I was in town shooting something in Tampa for Trip Flip or travel channel
*  and Mike Birbiglia was at the Tampa Improv and we were having sushi next door.
*  And I was like, I'm going to sneak my head in and just say like hi or whatever,
*  you know, cause I was a big fan.
*  I think Birbiglia to this day is one of the best storytellers around without a
*  fucking doubt.
*  I don't know.
*  Very good.
*  I honestly don't know if I would have the balls to be doing what I'm doing right now.
*  Birbiglia hadn't been the first guy to tell a long story.
*  Yeah. He really was the first, one of the first, the first one I remember on a standup
*  stage doing that.
*  And he was to write a blog and his blog became really popular.
*  My, my, what was it?
*  He was on NPR.
*  What was it?
*  Uh, my, it was, he would read it on Bob and Tom.
*  It was fucking huge.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I rolled into the Tampa Improv.
*  I'm drunk.
*  I'm fucking full sushi.
*  And I stick my head in the green room and I go, amen.
*  Uh, Burke Reicher just, I wouldn't know.
*  I like how you're trying to be complimentary.
*  And I could, I remember the look on his face was so dear in headlights.
*  And he was like, and I was like, just big fan where I'm in town.
*  I'm shooting my TV show.
*  I just want to come in and say hi.
*  And he was like, all right.
*  And then I was like, sign up for a minute.
*  He goes, are you asking for a guest set?
*  And I went, oh no, no, no, no, no.
*  And he was like, oh, thank God.
*  The real problem is I've given guys a guest set and then they go on and they
*  cover a topic that you cover.
*  That is true.
*  That's a problem.
*  I don't even think that you don't know what they're doing.
*  You have no idea what they're set as.
*  You know what the real fuck thing is though, if somebody opens for you
*  and then you're like, you have something like that.
*  And then they keep opening for you.
*  And then you're like, you see that I'm doing this, right?
*  Like, yeah, you know that I'm doing this.
*  Okay.
*  You're going to.
*  Oh, I've had guys continue to aversion, right?
*  You know how guys do it on purpose.
*  Like they try to step on your material.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're opening for you.
*  I'm always afraid too.
*  They're going to be like, if they do something and then you do it like,
*  Hey, I didn't take this from you just so you know, you have to tell us the show.
*  I already had my thing planned.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's just some guys will try to kill so that you bomb, you know, like the local guys.
*  That's always an issue.
*  If you go to a place and these fucking guys have never seen you before and they're like,
*  Tom's a girl.
*  Yeah.
*  Watch this motherfucker.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and they'll, you know,
*  Four fucking special effects.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking what?
*  Fuck this guy.
*  Dude, these fans are my fans.
*  They just got to see me and then they'll be following me.
*  They'll do a lot of local shit.
*  That's one thing.
*  They do a lot of local shit.
*  If they drive up that local shit, you know, they're wack as fuck immediately.
*  Like if they, they lean into it hard.
*  It's one thing to make like a, uh, like one or two comments, but if they, if it's,
*  if they do like six minutes.
*  Did I ever tell you about.
*  I did tell you.
*  My act was local when I lived in Boston.
*  But you were.
*  But you're starting out.
*  Yeah.
*  But it was, it was so sad when I would go on the road.
*  Oh, my best bits.
*  You guys remember third street?
*  People like, what?
*  No.
*  All my best.
*  You mean where the cartel ships are?
*  Like, no.
*  Okay.
*  If I could find a time machine, I would go back to Boston in the late eighties
*  and I'd have Joe Rogan open for me.
*  And I would just take him with me and be like, so, Hey, what, tell me what you think about
*  alien aliens.
*  And then just send me like, you know, I haven't really thought about it a lot yet,
*  but I've been reading these books.
*  I'm just starting to develop a thought.
*  It is so funny to be able to know somebody for a long time and then look up shit like
*  20 years ago.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, yeah, I can watch clips of you, of you like myself.
*  And I'm like, it's weird.
*  So weird.
*  There's the weirdest part about being friends with you is I was a fan of yours before I
*  was friends with you.
*  When you and Brian were doing that Joe show, I was like fucking so into that.
*  I was into this podcast before I ever got on the podcast.
*  And so like to know you, like I remember telling you one time about you and Jenna
*  Jamieson.
*  You're like, I've never been with Jenna Jamieson.
*  I was like, I'm fucking pretty certain I saw it.
*  You're like, I've never met her.
*  And I was like, I'm pretty sure there's a video out there of you guys at a party.
*  And you were like, I'm pretty sure.
*  And I was like, I watched it.
*  But you know, I think your memory sucks.
*  That's very, I didn't say I never met Jenna Jamieson.
*  You, by the way, hang on.
*  If there is an astute person, you will hear it on the podcast.
*  Saying that I didn't know her.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  This is way before she started dating Tito Ortiz.
*  This is like a long time ago.
*  I remember you and Jenna Jamieson.
*  By the way, I remember a party and yeah, with her husband.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Video of her husband.
*  She's explaining how to eat pussy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not crazy.
*  Just ruining the story.
*  Probably.
*  I wish Burbankly was here to save me.
*  He's giving you a version of the story that doesn't make sense.
*  But yeah, it is crazy to know of people's past lives.
*  I'll tell you what I would love a fucking documentary about is the store.
*  Like, cause I-
*  There's one coming out.
*  They're doing the Showtime thing.
*  Mike Binder's doing it and he's doing it real slow,
*  which makes you give real hope that it's going to be good.
*  He's taken like two years to do it.
*  By the way, I'm in that documentary.
*  I wish I hadn't said that out loud.
*  You're not even drunk.
*  What's going on with you?
*  You said I wish-
*  Did you have a stroke?
*  I wish it was a documentary knowing full well that I'm in.
*  I'm in the fucking documentary.
*  Did you have a stroke?
*  I might have.
*  I might have.
*  Let's make another cocktail.
*  Something happened.
*  There's plenty of booze.
*  There you go.
*  Try some of that Dan Aykroyd skull.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Alien skull.
*  Oh, that his is the skull one?
*  Yeah, I'll try it.
*  Is there more ice there by any chance?
*  But I'm curious always to know about like the store when I wasn't there.
*  It was the best in the early aughts.
*  But people say it was the worst.
*  Okay, for stand-up shows, sure, it was the worst.
*  For its entire purpose.
*  Energy-wise, it sounds like it was horrible.
*  No, Dom says it the best.
*  He goes there was this young group of-
*  Okay, I knew what is the employee section.
*  So I don't know that the people who were like 10, 12 year comics,
*  but as the employees, it was like we ran the place.
*  It was so much fun.
*  I just saw it as a foreign place.
*  We would go sneak in the back to see like the mainstream comics
*  who were fucking in the back.
*  Aykroyd.
*  Try some of this.
*  Oh, you want to try it?
*  Have you tried it?
*  I'm going to try it.
*  I'll try it.
*  Are you scared of Dan Aykroyd's alcohol?
*  I'm scared of any alcohol that I didn't pour in my-
*  Bring with me personally.
*  Oh, I just drank some of that, man.
*  There's nothing in there.
*  It's just Dan Aykroyd's.
*  We opened that.
*  That's because of me.
*  Like I would be curious to know like-
*  Big fan, big fan.
*  An in-depth history of like-
*  I want to know like-
*  Where it went up and then down and then up.
*  And then certain personalities,
*  why certain personalities didn't get closer.
*  When I thought they should have like in knowing them as adults,
*  they should be closer.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Closer to what?
*  Like, I don't know like-
*  Closer friends, you mean?
*  I would love to know like the camps
*  and like who were in the different camps and like-
*  There was no camaraderie back then.
*  There was some camaraderie with like door guys and stuff like that.
*  But there was a lot of like-
*  The problem was there was this leftover shit from guys
*  who were all struggling to get sitcoms.
*  They were all struggling to be the host of a talk show.
*  That's tonic.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Do you soda?
*  Yeah, it was good, Joe.
*  You're right.
*  It was good when there was a level of acceptance
*  that the place was a failure
*  and that we were just in it for jokes.
*  Yes.
*  And then we were like,
*  we're not going to get anything because
*  Bobby Lee was like the most successful guy
*  because he was on Mad TV.
*  The thing that was going on that was weird was that
*  the guys that were at the higher level,
*  there was a few that were left over
*  that had seen Kinnison take off
*  and they had seen David Letterman take off
*  and they were still there.
*  Right, good pace.
*  Yeah, there was a few of those guys that were left behind
*  and they were very bitter and they did not like young guys.
*  There was a different thing.
*  Like today when young guys are coming up or young girls,
*  anybody who's funny at the store gets love.
*  You know, whether it's a doorman
*  or somebody who works the booth,
*  there's no like, there's no anyone,
*  no one's trying to hold anybody down.
*  It's not like you're making it so I'm not.
*  Now it's like great.
*  The internet changed it all
*  because we all have a platform to help now.
*  Whereas before it was like the only way
*  you got successful was through television.
*  Television was the goal and if Tommy got a TV show,
*  you were like, fuck, that could have been my show.
*  And so there was this like backstabby,
*  weird fucking competition back then.
*  Yeah, now it's different.
*  Now if you get a guy, oh fuck.
*  Now everybody helps everybody.
*  That place is different now.
*  If you get like Santino,
*  suddenly from like no podcast to a successful podcast,
*  now everybody's like, oh, that's another platform I can go on.
*  Exactly.
*  Well it's also like when someone gets a Netflix special
*  or something, everybody gets happy
*  and everybody gets pumped and they also see like, hey,
*  if you bust your ass and you're good and you work hard,
*  you can get one too.
*  You can get one too.
*  Yeah, it's not like it used to be, man.
*  It was weird, man.
*  When I first got a sitcom and I came out here, 94,
*  I came out with a sitcom, already had a sitcom.
*  So when I came out here, I came out here to do a sitcom
*  and what was more important to me than anything
*  was being a paid regular at the store.
*  That's what I give a fuck about.
*  The sitcom was just, I felt like it's going to get canceled eventually.
*  I'm just going to make some money while I can
*  and this is way more money than I ever thought I could ever make.
*  But I'm going to do comedy.
*  And so then I would be hanging around the store
*  but there was no friends.
*  It was weird.
*  Who was there when you first went to the store, who was there?
*  Mencia was there.
*  He was there.
*  He was just starting.
*  Stan Hope and Ralphie?
*  What's that?
*  Stan Hope and Ralphie or no?
*  No, Stan Hope was never there.
*  Ralphie wasn't really there.
*  Schubert was there.
*  Schubert was there before me.
*  Schubert was there.
*  He was like Mitzi's driver back in the fucking day.
*  Did you know that he's passed at the Magic Castle?
*  Did you know that?
*  He's a magician?
*  Yeah.
*  Jimmy Schubert?
*  He's a really good magician?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  No kidding.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Yeah.
*  I asked Schubert once.
*  I was the door guy and his parents were there.
*  Philadelphia or something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, hey, do you get nervous when your parents,
*  because my parents see me like once ever and I was like,
*  do you get nervous when your parents see you?
*  He goes, no, no, they see me a bunch of the times.
*  I don't care.
*  But he goes, no, when Mitzi's here, you know, that's tough.
*  And I've been inside of her.
*  I was like, what?
*  Yeah, he used to bang Mitzi when he was a young fella.
*  He was.
*  Are you serious?
*  Yeah.
*  That's how he got spots.
*  Yep.
*  She was straight up like, if you want to get up, you got to get it up.
*  Yeah.
*  That was back in the day.
*  It was OK to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  No one had a problem with it.
*  It's not like a Harvey Weinstein type deal.
*  Yeah.
*  Also the counterpunchers.
*  It was a shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And we gave a fuck.
*  But like back then, it was like there was a few big guys would stop in.
*  Like Martin Lawrence would stop in.
*  There was a few guys.
*  Was he cool?
*  Paul Rodriguez.
*  I never got to talk to him.
*  He's friendly with me now.
*  But back then, I would go on after him, just eat shit.
*  Do you remember him as the host of Def Jam?
*  Dude, he was fucking amazing.
*  Bro, listen, man.
*  When I got past his door.
*  Stepping into the pussy.
*  Remember that joke?
*  Should I light another cigar or are we getting done close to it on?
*  No, I'm going to relight this one.
*  But you can light another one.
*  Is that OK?
*  I just remember this to me, I think, is such a compliment to him.
*  But I mean it sincerely.
*  Because I was obsessed.
*  I would go in our basement to watch Def Jam.
*  You smell good.
*  I couldn't watch that in the living room.
*  You have to watch that in the basement.
*  And he was so funny and just engaging.
*  They're so charismatic that I would look forward to the interstitials.
*  To him coming back just to introduce the next person.
*  Because that's how funny he was.
*  He was on top of the world.
*  Yeah, he really was.
*  Back then, I was a young comic who was not very good.
*  And I used to have to go on after him.
*  What time were you on?
*  Every whenever someone was good, I would be on after him.
*  Anybody who crushed, whether it was Dice.
*  That's when your spot was.
*  Anybody who was good, Martin Lawrence.
*  I would go on after Martin Lawrence.
*  You'd go on stage with a leather jumpsuit on.
*  How did you get past?
*  What was your showcase like?
*  This is why I got past.
*  There was a guy named The Todd.
*  Do you remember The Todd?
*  The Todd went crazy.
*  The Todd went crazy.
*  But before he went crazy, he helped me out.
*  He told me to do this for other people.
*  When I was first starting out, Mitzi thought I was OK.
*  But I could work as a non-paid regular.
*  And I was, I think I was 26.
*  And so I was doing sets at the store after the show.
*  So the show would go on to whatever, 1 o'clock in the morning.
*  And I was there every fucking night.
*  And I did that for six months.
*  And then I had no friends.
*  I didn't know anybody here.
*  Yeah, I didn't know anybody here.
*  So I just moved here to do a television.
*  You were just hanging out in the hallway, guy?
*  I would just go up.
*  I would go up after the show was over.
*  I knew that I could get a spot at 1 o'clock in the morning if I waited.
*  What time was the last spot back then?
*  I don't remember.
*  I remember I would go on always around 1 a.m.
*  And there was very few people in the crowd.
*  But she gave me a showcase.
*  I did the showcase.
*  She goes, you could be a non-paid regular.
*  So I was like, good.
*  So I can do sets after the show.
*  So I'd go and I'd sit around and I'd wait and I'd watch.
*  I didn't have a life back then.
*  I had the sitcom that I was doing during the day.
*  And then at nighttime, I had no friends.
*  I had just moved here.
*  So I'd just hang around the store.
*  And I was really disappointed because the store was mecca to me, man.
*  Back when I lived in Boston, I was like, I heard about the comedy store.
*  That's where Kinnison was.
*  We were all like, one day we're going to go to the comedy store in L.A.
*  And I went there and there was these Bodax, man.
*  These fucking casino acts.
*  They were terrible.
*  There was so many bad comics that had missed the wave.
*  There was a wave in the 1980s where basically anybody could be a comic.
*  You just had to talk like a comedian.
*  I'm looking at my cat and I'm like, what is this wild kingdom in my living room?
*  And there was these fucking shucking, jiving, non-perspective having guys.
*  And a few of them lingered.
*  And so those are the ones that were at the store.
*  So the wave of Kinnison.
*  I'm here in 94, right?
*  Kinnison was huge in 88.
*  You got to realize that's only six years.
*  So Kinnison's huge in 88 and then he dies in 92, right?
*  And somewhere around then.
*  I'm living in New York when he died.
*  And then I'm in LA two years later in the fucking places of Ghost Town.
*  I'm telling you, it was like-
*  Did you think it died because he died?
*  It was a big part of it.
*  It was a big part of it.
*  Well, I kept hearing about all these celebrities that would come to the comedy store to see Kinnison.
*  And I was like, wow, they all came to see Kinnison.
*  That's crazy.
*  They came to see him.
*  Like all these fucking rock stars and Keith Richards and fucking movie stars and Belushi
*  and all these guys would come to the comedy store.
*  That shit was gone by the time I got there.
*  So by the time I got there, the comedy store has gone through these in the past.
*  He's like peaks and valleys.
*  And I got there in a valley.
*  But I stayed, I was there for like six months and this guy, the Todd was there, right?
*  And the Todd, that's the Todd right there.
*  That guy, I owe that guy a lot.
*  He's gone now.
*  Anyway, the Todd had like a severe mental episode where he literally, something went wrong.
*  Like some sort of a disease, something went wrong mentally and he lost his mind.
*  But before he would last his mind, he sat down next to Mitzi.
*  So when Mitzi tried me for my second showcase, I went up and I did my set.
*  I had a good set, but the Todd was laughing hard.
*  He sat down next to Mitzi.
*  He's like, and Mitzi's like, he's funny.
*  And Todd was like, that guy's fucking funny.
*  He's fucking funny.
*  And I was cool with him.
*  He was a very friendly guy.
*  He saw you doing late night spots before?
*  He saw me banging it out.
*  And then he came to me off stage and goes, I sat down next to Mitzi and I laughed really hard
*  because I came off stage and Mitzi goes, you're passed.
*  You're going to be a paid regular call in the morning.
*  I'll get you some sets.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  I'm a fucking paid regular at the store.
*  Granted, I'm on a television show at the time, right?
*  I didn't give a fuck about that TV show.
*  You got 35 grand an episode.
*  That TV show was terrible.
*  It was a baseball show called Hardball.
*  It was terrible.
*  And it could have been good too.
*  I watched, I watched the guys who wrote The Simpsons wrote it.
*  They wrote on Married with Children.
*  Really good writers.
*  And Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran.
*  They're really funny, really talented, really smart guys.
*  And Fox just fucking brutalized their show, brutalized it.
*  And they brought in all the hacks and they chopped it up.
*  So I was in hell doing this terrible sitcom.
*  You know, I'm making good money though.
*  But-
*  Where we living?
*  Where we living?
*  Oakwood's Apartments on-
*  Of course you were.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like the pilot place to live in.
*  Yeah, that's the pilot place.
*  Sly and pussy.
*  I think by then I might have gotten an apartment in North Hollywood.
*  I got an apartment in North Hollywood a few months in because I figured it was going to
*  stick around for a while.
*  And then, you know, she gave me the thing and then Todd pulled me aside and he goes,
*  hey, he goes, I sat down next to Mitzi and I laughed really hard.
*  And he goes, and that's how you get someone passed.
*  And he goes, one day you're going to do that for people too.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  You did it for Chris McGuire.
*  Dude, I fucking hosted it for Chris McGuire because this terrible comedian was supposed
*  to do the hosting gig.
*  He was supposed to host open mic night.
*  And I found out McGuire was going to do his showcase.
*  Mitzi thought it was funny to put this terrible comedian up and have him host.
*  I mean, he was impossibly bad.
*  I like how you're intentionally not doing his thing.
*  Yes, I'm not saying anything.
*  So I-
*  Thank you very much.
*  No, you definitely don't.
*  So I called up and this is when I was on news radio.
*  I called up and I said, hey, I go fuck this.
*  I go, I'm going to host open mic night.
*  So I came down and hosted open mic night just for McGuire.
*  But I did that for a bunch of people.
*  I sat down next to Mitzi while people were showcasing funny people and just laugh.
*  Just laugh hard, clap.
*  And it would influence her.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  It influences everybody.
*  Having a good room makes everybody-
*  I've seen a billion shows.
*  It's still, if somebody's doing well, I can't see through or not doing well.
*  I'm like, that guy's bad.
*  I'm pretty sure I did that for Diaz.
*  Oh yeah?
*  I did it for so many people.
*  Look, man, I was so thankful.
*  And then one day I didn't see him for a long time.
*  That's all right.
*  Yeah, I didn't see him for a long time.
*  He went by The Todd?
*  Yeah, The Todd.
*  The Todd.
*  He was gone for- he used to open for Paul.
*  He was one of Paulie's buddies.
*  Any relation, do you think, to the Charlie's Angel name of-
*  fucking what's his name's character in that?
*  Todd Lemish, it says.
*  That's his name.
*  There it is.
*  What is- what is this?
*  That's an old lineup from 1986.
*  Yeah, article from Buzzfeed about the-
*  Well, let me see that lineup.
*  Go back down.
*  Go back down.
*  Wow, look at that.
*  Jimmy Schubert.
*  I think these people-
*  Ceylon Green.
*  Nancy Redmond.
*  I remember Nancy Redmond.
*  Nice to do sets with her in New York.
*  Bobby Luddington.
*  Steve Kravitz.
*  I knew him too.
*  Mark Maron.
*  Look at that, 87.
*  Was Brett Ratner?
*  That's the Brett Ratner?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Maron's there in 87?
*  Maybe. It might have been.
*  No, Maron was there for a short time.
*  Then he went to New York and he was obsessed with the comedy story.
*  With Jerusalem Syndrome, about being there.
*  And then when he came back, he was all shell-shocked.
*  Well, in 94, is it Robert Downey Jr.?
*  That's just- on this, it says it's unconfirmed.
*  Oh.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So in 87, when Maron was there, I met him right after that in 88.
*  Maron?
*  Because he moved to Boston.
*  So he was doing sets in Boston.
*  Maron was- Maron gave me like one of the nicest pieces of advice or compliments
*  that anybody ever gave me when I was in my-
*  Invest in Bitcoin.
*  He didn't say that.
*  Wait, what was the other one that I-
*  Oh, Brett Ratner.
*  He just told me to keep going and it was funny.
*  He said, you can do this, man.
*  You're really original.
*  You got a great voice.
*  You used to hang out at the- when I was an employee,
*  every once in a while you would hang out just watching the employee section.
*  And I didn't realize it.
*  It makes me think now how it's important for like-
*  just that it was a paid regular and a guy on a sitcom that would just like sit and watch us.
*  And it was like, cool.
*  I like comedy, man.
*  I like supporting comedians.
*  I've always liked supporting comedians.
*  Because from my martial arts background, like camaraderie and like the whole team and
*  helping everybody, like having a good group.
*  I always knew the value in that.
*  It's very important to have a good community.
*  Now, can you watch comedy online, like on Instagram?
*  Yeah, it's good.
*  Yeah, I watch good clips.
*  I lost it.
*  The Todd thing, let me get back to that.
*  Because so what happened was one day I got there and I hadn't seen him for a long time.
*  I forget how long, but it was a long time.
*  And he was hanging out in the front patio, but he was weird.
*  He was just really weird.
*  And I don't remember who told me.
*  And they said, yeah, he lost his mind.
*  And something happened.
*  I think he maybe even had an operation.
*  Something was really wrong.
*  And he was just hanging around, almost like trying to.
*  He stopped doing comedy entirely.
*  Trying to remember.
*  Yeah, trying to remember what it was like.
*  Eleanor said he'd do this thing where he used to do this thing to fuck with the bartenders.
*  We'd take a glass and look at him and then chuck it in the garbage.
*  And then, but he didn't remember that he had had a camaraderie with the bartender.
*  He would just remember that he had done that.
*  So he would kind of like go up and still like take a glass and put it in the garbage.
*  And some new bartender was like, who is this?
*  What's he doing?
*  Yeah, he was, it was real.
*  It was real weird, man.
*  And it was the first time I'd ever seen anybody like be fine and then be gone.
*  And I didn't know.
*  I didn't understand what happened.
*  But that guy, man, he did me a giant solid, giant solid.
*  I'll never forget that.
*  And it influenced me too to make sure that I passed that on.
*  Who are the guys that did you guys like favors?
*  Not even like I'm doing your favor, but like things like that.
*  Like you said, like, you know, but Todd did or like, you know, just like helped you where
*  you're like, oh, that was a big help.
*  Just guys treating you like you belong.
*  Treating like a human.
*  Don Herrera was a big one, man.
*  Burt.
*  What?
*  No, Burt Joe.
*  Yeah, it took me on the road.
*  Russell Peters.
*  Yeah.
*  Tom, you brought me to Indy.
*  I did.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  You said it's a break even week.
*  I mean, she won't pay for her flight, but you'll make enough money to pay for your flight.
*  And then you got booked there.
*  Yeah.
*  That was big.
*  Joe, obviously, you know, taking me on the road.
*  Jay Moore was big for us.
*  Jay Moore was big for us.
*  Jay Moore was really big for us.
*  It stinks that it turned out the way it did, but he was really big and like,
*  you know, as I always say, you learn a lot from people on both sides of the fence.
*  Good and bad.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I learned a lot about what I didn't want to do because I'd watch Jay.
*  Jay is so amazingly talented and I'd watch him get in his way sometimes.
*  And I'd be like, God, man, I don't want to do that.
*  And Tom and I would talk privately about going like just the weirdest fucking things.
*  He was, man, he was so talented.
*  He was a fun hang.
*  He was a fun hang.
*  Jay's a fun hang.
*  And he was really funny, man.
*  And he was so...
*  And he's still, I mean, he's still corn.
*  Dude, you could give that guy a premise.
*  You could give him a premise like just the silliest thing and he could improv it on stage.
*  You definitely had a stroke about 20 months ago, huh?
*  Yeah, probably.
*  But yeah, no, no, no.
*  Jay was a big...
*  I mean, I can't, I mean, I can't...
*  Obviously, Jay and I don't speak anymore.
*  Yeah, he was great in that fucking Jerry Maguire movie.
*  Are you guys capable of like pushing the bad parts out yet?
*  Yeah.
*  Seeing the good parts?
*  Yeah.
*  It sounds like this is the first time where I've heard about it.
*  Like I don't mind.
*  Obviously, Jay and I don't speak.
*  But yeah, but we both had...
*  Negative experiences.
*  That's why we're not friends with him anymore.
*  But there was a lot of good things.
*  That's the reason I met Tom is because...
*  How did he find you guys?
*  He found Tom through his assistant, Charlie.
*  Yep.
*  And...
*  When I met you, it was at a show opening.
*  That was the best.
*  I was the MC, he was the middle.
*  Burt was the middle and Jay was the headliner.
*  Immediately, within like fucking five seconds, Tom and I bonded.
*  Like within five fucking seconds.
*  I remember he walked in and he goes...
*  Florida State game was on.
*  Tom's watching Florida State game.
*  And Tom's like, oh, come on.
*  Jay's like, what the fuck is this?
*  And I go, oh, you're watching Florida State?
*  Because I went there.
*  Tom's like, yeah.
*  He's like, you got money on it?
*  And Tom's like, yeah, I got 100 bucks on it.
*  And he's like, you're making fucking 50 bucks tonight as a host.
*  What kind of fucking aid are you?
*  Walked out and I was like, look, Tom, I go, hey, welcome to the tour, man.
*  I remember being like how much I...
*  I'm so nerded out that he went to FSU.
*  I was like, you went to FSU?
*  He's like, yeah, I went there for like 15 years or something.
*  And I was like...
*  They wrote a book about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, what?
*  And then I go, when?
*  And then he tells me the...
*  I go, oh, you guys won a national championship when you were there.
*  And I was like, hey, so was like...
*  I just mentioned like a player.
*  I don't know, whatever.
*  I was like, was Derek Brookster?
*  And he was like, oh, I don't know any of the players.
*  No, no, hold on.
*  What?
*  You don't fucking...
*  No, hold on.
*  You don't know any of the guys' names?
*  No, I know.
*  I think I told you this and this made you laugh.
*  I think this is what made you laugh.
*  Derek Brooks was a big player at Florida State, right?
*  Him and Work Done.
*  When I was in my senior year of college,
*  I went to the gas station and they had a single, a cassette single of Brooks and Dunn.
*  And I went, oh, wow, our two biggest players released a single.
*  Fucking dork.
*  This has got to be good, right?
*  I'm a big fan of hip hop, so I bought the single of Brooks and Dunn.
*  Not realizing it's a country, western band.
*  They weren't big yet.
*  And I put it in and it was country music.
*  And I went, so Derek Brooks and Work Dunn made a country album.
*  That's interesting.
*  Oh my god.
*  And I listened to the whole fucking thing.
*  The whole thing?
*  I was like, one song, I was like, this is not bad.
*  I'm a fan of the guys.
*  I'm a fan of the...
*  Yeah, I'm in, I'm in.
*  And I think I told you that and you were like, Brooks and Dunn is not Work Brooks.
*  And you went to college.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you go?
*  Did I go?
*  Yeah.
*  He was gorgeous back then.
*  You dropped out.
*  Yeah.
*  You went all the way through and then some?
*  Kinda.
*  All the way.
*  I had to take prison classes in New York.
*  What's that mean?
*  What does that mean?
*  So it was before the internet.
*  So you would, if you didn't finish school, you had to send in to the state of Florida
*  and say, I want to finish college.
*  And they give you the books that they give to the prisoners.
*  Send them to me in New York.
*  I just had to read the books and write papers.
*  The prisoners?
*  Yeah.
*  So like if you want to get a college course in prison, they send you the books and you
*  just do the work?
*  Basically.
*  And you would fill that shit out.
*  What?
*  Just fill it out.
*  Just basically, I got the books and I got the tests.
*  And I just had to fill out the tests.
*  Do you ever wonder if you were in prison, how much shit you'd get done?
*  I did not.
*  Do you think that?
*  I did not.
*  I did not.
*  You would get really fit.
*  I do.
*  If I was in prison, I'd read books all day and I would do sit-ups.
*  I would lift so many bricks.
*  Yes.
*  I would think how many times.
*  Pull-ups.
*  How many times would I walk myself into a rape?
*  Where I'd go like, you guys aren't going to rape me.
*  They're like, well, we weren't even thinking about that.
*  But now that you brought it up.
*  You seem like we can.
*  You seem pretty soft.
*  Yeah.
*  They probably want to rape a hard guy just for like, you know, so it's a real good win.
*  It's a notch on the-
*  Yeah.
*  A good win.
*  You know, if you rape like a gang leader.
*  Yeah.
*  Turn him.
*  You rape like a super tweak, a twink.
*  It's like, eh, who cares?
*  He wanted it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But get like Tim Silvia in there.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  If Rape Mercer raped Tim Silvia.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Giant feather in his cap.
*  Giant feather, so to speak.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's talk about Tom behind his back.
*  Okay.
*  When you first met Tom, how quickly did you like him?
*  Instantly.
*  Why is he-
*  Why does he have that?
*  Well, it was funny.
*  We were at the Celebrity Theater.
*  We were doing the Maxim Tour.
*  It was John Heffron, Charlie Murphy, and me.
*  And every town that we went to, there would be a new guy that would open.
*  A local guy.
*  Or in Tom's case, a guy from LA that was somehow or another they'd-
*  They picked him for-
*  They picked him for-
*  Yeah. They picked him to do it.
*  Yeah.
*  He was really funny.
*  He was really funny.
*  And he and I got along like that.
*  I met him when you said like, it was Diaz or Duncan that week.
*  It was Tom Sygora after that show.
*  And it was like, okay.
*  And then he was there and it was like, hey.
*  It was like 40 seconds uncomfortable.
*  And then it was like, he was like, out of here again.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you know what?
*  Here's what I was going to say about like, here's what's real important about comics.
*  Recognizing that the doorman and the opening acts and the middle acts will one day be your peers.
*  They are your peers.
*  That's the store.
*  That's the store.
*  There's no other club like that was this direct line from brand, brand new employee
*  to massive theater sellout where it's like those came from there.
*  Bobby Lee was a door guy.
*  You were a door guy when I met you.
*  Yeah. But like there were other guys who were like straight from there too.
*  So it's like, it's not like you would be a dick to them, but like they're going to be you.
*  And the guys who are big were like, I was that.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Well, it's like there's a comradery in the, in the game.
*  We're all trying to write a good dick joke.
*  Yeah. And we all support each other.
*  We're all fucking weirdos.
*  You know, like this is, it's a rare weirdo.
*  There's not that many of us, man.
*  You know, there's a small amount of human beings on the planet earth that make a living telling jokes.
*  I mean, worldwide.
*  I did see a picture of a Tom on one of your specials early on and he was so fat.
*  You were so fat.
*  Oh yeah. That should be noted.
*  When he started fat shaming me, he was like two, eight.
*  What was your biggest that you were?
*  Notice that when he started fat shaming me, he was fatter than me.
*  Oh, he was so much fatter than you.
*  Yeah. He had just lost some weight. He goes, I think I'm fatter than you now.
*  Oh, and he was still 270.
*  It wasn't that. It's that when you're fat and other people get fat,
*  like it doesn't mean that you're not fat. It's just like they are too.
*  Yeah.
*  I was 240 at the time.
*  Were you 240?
*  I was 240 when I started trying to lose weight.
*  You're always not accurate with those numbers.
*  Why do you pick up on numbers?
*  I just let the story go.
*  Numbers are big. You're about 253.
*  Where are you at now?
*  Are you up or down since the last podcast?
*  We got a scale.
*  I'm way down.
*  You still have a scale.
*  I'm way down.
*  I'm meant to get one.
*  We have a scale.
*  I'm never getting on a scale.
*  Joe, Joe, Joe, I will never.
*  I want to see where I'm at after Columbia.
*  My special I shot, I was 220 when I shot it.
*  When were you really?
*  Yeah.
*  How'd you do that?
*  I'm so fat in it. You see it? I'm so fat.
*  220. How'd you get down there?
*  Sober October. Dude, the funny thing is when we started Sober October,
*  it was this whole thing like, can you not drink for a minute?
*  And that was the first time.
*  Five years ago, whatever.
*  We were trying to save your life.
*  Yeah, we were like-
*  I think you did, maybe.
*  I don't know about that.
*  By the way, I'm much better today.
*  I did have a little bit of a stroke.
*  You were just drifting with the conversation.
*  I got so into it.
*  I got so into it.
*  You were trying to say that I said that I didn't know Jenna Jameson.
*  What are you talking about?
*  Someone will find that clip.
*  When Jamie pulled this October started,
*  do you remember where you were at the end of September?
*  Yeah, you just lost a bunch of weight.
*  At the end of September, beginning of October?
*  Yeah, you just lost a bunch of weight.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, you just lost a bunch of weight.
*  I'm actually going strong beforehand.
*  I was going strong into October.
*  I got down to 220 on my special.
*  Joe said, can you be down to 205 at the end of October?
*  That's okay.
*  I remember that.
*  That's nothing, man.
*  How did you not make 205?
*  You could have got that-
*  I stopped caring.
*  I can't have that brain set going into a special
*  where I'm obsessed with my weight.
*  I needed to work on material and I was like, I'm going to be me.
*  I'm going to work out.
*  I'm going to have fun.
*  You looked as good as John Panett of six months before he died.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  What do you want?
*  By the way, the fact that Tom's weight is not brought up at all.
*  I believe Tom is fatter than Bert and has been for many months.
*  I wish you had seen the boxes I'd given your presence in.
*  Tom's foot is so much smaller than your-
*  What do you mean?
*  He's 5'8 tops, right?
*  5'8 and a half?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't mind that because people are always pleasantly surprised when they meet me.
*  You go ahead and put it out there.
*  Bullshit.
*  Every time I do a meet and greet, they go, hey, Tom actually is fatter than you.
*  And I go, no fucking shit.
*  I never hear that.
*  What size shoe do you have?
*  I never hear that.
*  What size shoe do you have?
*  10 and a half.
*  Seven?
*  10 and a half.
*  That's not that-
*  Joe's got 11.
*  Okay.
*  Ari's got a 12.
*  You know what's annoying?
*  When you get an 11 in some shoes and it's too small.
*  Chuck Taylors are run different.
*  Chuck's, yeah, man.
*  They're like a half a size too small.
*  Wait, Tom, how big are you now?
*  Let's not change the subject too much.
*  Let's see how big you are now, Tom.
*  How much do I weigh?
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like you've lost some weight since the beginning of October.
*  That's probably true.
*  We have a scale.
*  No, we're not.
*  No, that's not-
*  Let's get the scale.
*  Jamie, call that up.
*  Get that scale.
*  Jamie, call that scale.
*  No.
*  You got a scale?
*  I'd like to see how much I weigh after Columbia.
*  And then if you guys want to weigh as well, that's okay.
*  Joe, would you be manner enough to weigh yourself?
*  Yeah, I'm about 205 right now.
*  I have to predict what I weigh?
*  Predict.
*  I'm going to be honest with you though.
*  I honestly have not been on a scale in a long time.
*  Me?
*  So I'm just saying it'll be a total guess.
*  Every morning I say I got to stop eating carbs.
*  Every time I get on the scale.
*  It'll be a total guess.
*  I got down to 194 at one point in time.
*  Hey, Jamie, you can put that back.
*  You did get under obese and you also got under obese.
*  No, no, no.
*  I think I was still obese.
*  I think it was not.
*  Well, yeah.
*  No, I did the math on both of you when you posted it.
*  But not obese.
*  Right.
*  What do you think you weigh, Bert?
*  235.
*  You think you'll weigh that now?
*  I would.
*  Right there, baby.
*  If you're...
*  No, I'm obviously going first because I'm the tallest.
*  No, no, no.
*  Hold on.
*  We're not weighing in.
*  We're not weighing in.
*  We're definitely not weighing in.
*  We're definitely weighing in.
*  We're definitely not weighing in.
*  You are, man.
*  It's just the number.
*  What do you give a fuck?
*  Because...
*  I will get totally fucking nude and pissed.
*  Obby.
*  Hey.
*  Say that, Tim.
*  You're going to see his cock now.
*  How do you say obviously in Spanish?
*  Obva?
*  Obvi?
*  Obvi?
*  How do you say obviously in Spanish?
*  Obvia.
*  Obvia.
*  I knew it was something close.
*  What are you doing?
*  What are you doing?
*  Don't take your pants off, bro.
*  Don't take a piss.
*  Don't put your underwear on the ground.
*  Don't piss on the ground.
*  You can put your pants back on because I'm definitely not getting on a scale.
*  Underwear only.
*  Why are you scared of scales, Bert?
*  Because, Joe, it's not like this hasn't defined the last four years of my life online.
*  But you're doing well right now.
*  You look great.
*  Yeah, thanks, guys.
*  I'd rather people think I look great than know what I weigh.
*  My target weight is 175 to 180.
*  Okay.
*  Target weight.
*  That's like loose skin.
*  Yeah, that's weird.
*  Remember when Ari had a six pack?
*  Ari what was that?
*  Ari had a full six pack.
*  Look at that.
*  He's got a little bit of a six pack there.
*  He's skinny.
*  No, he's got abs.
*  It's not just that he's skinny.
*  What do you got?
*  Zero.
*  It's on carpet, Ari.
*  Big money, big money.
*  180?
*  It's the carpet.
*  It's the carpet.
*  180.6.
*  And that is with socks on.
*  Yeah, it's the carpet.
*  I don't trust carpet on these scales.
*  Okay, man.
*  You don't have to get on it.
*  That's after two weeks in Columbia with nothing but fried food.
*  I'm okay with that.
*  You look good, dude.
*  Late in the day.
*  Chicharron today for lunch.
*  One thing that I did realize when you did Sober October, when we did the fitness challenge,
*  is that if you just went whole hog and went crazy, you'd be a beast.
*  I ate nearly whole hog today.
*  No, but I mean if you worked out really hard, you'd have a good body.
*  Here's the thing that I learned in Sober October, and Tom kept having to say this to me over
*  and over again, is that what makes Ari Ari is not going full hog.
*  If you go full hog, it's not Ari.
*  And the same with me.
*  I get obsessed with weight and it starts to be every one of my thoughts.
*  The thing that defines you is...
*  Oh, fuck.
*  The thing that defines you...
*  Take this slow.
*  Is...
*  No, it's not even that crazy.
*  It's true, and you'll know it's true, is I'm going to wait until the fourth quarter
*  to really turn around.
*  That's what we're fighting for.
*  Bert's a quammer.
*  And then in the fourth quarter, you'll do it insane.
*  But there's no way you're going to be like, I'm going to study for this shit.
*  You're never going to prepare.
*  No.
*  But when you say things, when you say things like...
*  One of the times you said, I could do a split.
*  What were you thinking?
*  When you got down and you knew you were going to...
*  Did you think magically all of a sudden you would get really flexible?
*  But the pure confidence he goes in with it.
*  We're thinking like, I've never done a split in my life.
*  I know they're hard to do and I can do it.
*  Even though I know he's a bullshit.
*  Part of me was like, wow, Bert can do a split.
*  Because he did a marathon.
*  He did do a marathon.
*  With nothing.
*  He ran four miles in his life and then he fucking did a marathon the next day.
*  He spent five or six on a treadmill, which is like one in real life.
*  That is true.
*  He did do a marathon.
*  You will say I can do that to anything.
*  Jamie, get on the screen.
*  I'll say I can do that to anything.
*  You're definitely right about that.
*  Which way, Jamie?
*  Why do I have to get on?
*  Oh, you don't have to get on.
*  Because it'll help everyone else get on it.
*  But don't you feel that way?
*  What?
*  I can do anything.
*  No.
*  You can do anything.
*  No.
*  But do you think...
*  Great discourse.
*  This is actually what defines the two of you.
*  Keep going.
*  No.
*  I think the same fire burns for both of us, right?
*  So...
*  What?
*  You think...
*  Yeah, but your fire is maybe carne.
*  No.
*  Based on the thing that...
*  Of like you can do anything, right?
*  You go, no, I can't.
*  I need to work harder.
*  You have another stroke?
*  No, no, no.
*  You go, no, I can't.
*  Say it.
*  Say it.
*  I need to work harder.
*  I can't shoot a bow and arrow a perfect shot.
*  I want to learn that.
*  I want to bust my ass.
*  I want to do that.
*  I'm the opposite way where I go, just give me a shot.
*  Let me try this right now.
*  That's unrealistic.
*  You can surf.
*  That is your guy's personality difference.
*  Our personality difference is very different.
*  I'm very objective about what I can and can't do.
*  That's how you get good at things.
*  You have to really look at what you're good and not good at
*  and then work really hard at getting good at things.
*  Otherwise, you're just bullshitting yourself.
*  And that gets you hurt if you're a fighter.
*  That gets you really hurt.
*  Yeah, but I'm not a fighter.
*  I think it actually is really interesting to think about.
*  Your background is what informs that opinion you just expressed.
*  And his experience is that saying that sometimes works out.
*  That's why he keeps saying it.
*  I didn't study in college.
*  Rolling Stone discovered me.
*  All of a sudden, I got a career.
*  He's the guy who will say, it's bizarre, right?
*  But it worked.
*  You will be somebody who says-
*  Go to New York, Will Smith discovers me.
*  Mickey Mattlejohn.
*  What the fuck?
*  Say I want to run a marathon, I do it.
*  And then I go, and then you should have heard me the day I ran the marathon.
*  I was like, I think I can actually do anything.
*  Wait, didn't you say something?
*  Did you say something about kicking field goals?
*  I think I can kick a field goal.
*  How long did you kick a field goal?
*  I feel like I can kick a 35-yarder easily with no worries.
*  Thank you, Ari.
*  Absolutely.
*  Remember when Scott Norwood missed a 35-yarder?
*  And they lined up, and they said everybody at Washington Stadium was going to try a 35-yarder.
*  And people did it, people didn't do it.
*  I could easily kick a 35-yarder.
*  Thank you, Ari.
*  I never kicked a marathon.
*  Thank you, Ari.
*  I wonder how far you could actually cook a football if you've never kicked a football before.
*  You have what they call explosivity.
*  So you could kick it a lot farther.
*  That's what Pat McAfee phrased.
*  You could kick it a lot farther than I could.
*  I've never kicked anything personally.
*  Well, I've kicked things my whole life.
*  That's why I'm wondering how far I could kick a football.
*  Well, man, if I could kick it straight too.
*  Because I could roundhouse kick shit pretty fucking hard.
*  That's interesting, actually.
*  That's actually-
*  I bet.
*  Because the whip all you have to do is-
*  You would have to take five tries to learn how to kick it straight.
*  And then once you did that, you could go far.
*  But the power would be nuts.
*  Knock that motherfucker down the moon.
*  Now, the thing about a field goal isn't necessarily the kicking.
*  It's the mindset.
*  But it's the timing.
*  Could you roll in?
*  No, no, no.
*  Can you roll into the moment under pressure and perform?
*  But that's in the game.
*  No, in a game.
*  No, that's what a field goal is.
*  So in a game, you got guys running at you.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But in a practice, let's say someone's holding it for you, right?
*  Or it's on one of those tees propped up, and you're just going through the execution of
*  kicking a field goal.
*  But hold on.
*  That's not a field goal.
*  This is my point.
*  What do you mean it's not a field goal?
*  So what they're doing to college kids now is saying, you want a scholarship?
*  One shot, 51 yards.
*  Can you make this?
*  You get a scholarship.
*  Yeah, but you practice for it.
*  No, no, no.
*  But I'm saying they are 100% doing that.
*  They're not lining up a guy going one shot, 51 yards.
*  You can get a scholarship.
*  Please Google that, Jamie.
*  What college is this?
*  What are you talking about?
*  Jamie, please Google that.
*  What else?
*  Are you playing with kickers?
*  That sounds ridiculous.
*  Jamie, please Google it.
*  Jamie, and hold on.
*  What is this college?
*  It's college.
*  Do you want to go to college?
*  $50,000.
*  $50,000.
*  $50,000 running on it.
*  It's 100% happening.
*  It's 100% happening.
*  It's 100% happening.
*  $50,000, $60,000.
*  You're like, hey, we'll give it to you.
*  Jamie, pull it up, please.
*  Just kick that ball once.
*  There was, what was your idea?
*  You were trying to get those guys on the scale.
*  What?
*  Let's go.
*  Let's see it.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Let's get this field goal thing out first.
*  So they are doing that for kids to get a scholarship because they're thinking,
*  fuck, we need you in a pressure moment.
*  No bigger moment than you winning your scholarship.
*  They've done this for real.
*  100%.
*  I saw it online.
*  I was like, shut the fuck up.
*  Kid made it.
*  Kid made a field goal.
*  And he got a scholarship.
*  51 yards.
*  Oh, I say numbers.
*  What are you worried about?
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  51 yards is really far.
*  That's a legit field goal.
*  But I'm telling you, it's not a fucking chip-in.
*  No.
*  No, it's hard.
*  That the kid's doing to get a scholarship.
*  They do it and say, you want your fucking scholarship, hit a field goal.
*  I definitely saw it online.
*  I know it's a real thing.
*  But my point is, can you moment?
*  Jamie, let's not look that up yet, by the way.
*  He's the master of looking things up.
*  Hey, Siri, look up 51.
*  No, fucking shit.
*  Stroke.
*  Fuck off.
*  Hey, Siri, go through stroke analysis.
*  Jamie, is that an even there for real?
*  51.
*  Planet 51.
*  Planet 51.
*  51 is a 51 planet?
*  There's a guy in Nevada that gave a scholarship.
*  After he hit the game winning, he was already on the team.
*  There was a guy, I'm telling you.
*  That's a little different story.
*  That's totally different.
*  Slightly different.
*  I wish this still was live.
*  This podcast was live and had all the guys on it.
*  That's true.
*  It's being broadcast live.
*  Here we go.
*  Here we go.
*  Here we go.
*  What?
*  If, this is a video of it, Coach offers scholarship if Kicker hits 53 yard field goal.
*  But it's just, this is one video.
*  Yeah, but he's a player.
*  They're offering him a scholarship if he can do it.
*  That's how that works.
*  Walk on Kicker and Offrey couldn't refuse.
*  But that's not a student, right?
*  He's the walk on kicker.
*  Oh no, they didn't let him.
*  That's close.
*  I'll give Burt and this is closer than we thought.
*  So they give this guy a shot.
*  Here it is.
*  Everyone's around.
*  Let's watch this.
*  Let's watch this.
*  Here we go.
*  Hut.
*  Boom.
*  And he gets his fucking scholarship.
*  Damn.
*  Is that kind of what I said off by two yard yards?
*  No, I'll give it to you.
*  Thank you, Ari.
*  That is it.
*  It's actually harder than what you said.
*  Yeah, it actually is.
*  53 yard field goal.
*  Kid just got a scholarship.
*  Damn, that's amazing.
*  But that's the fucking college tuition.
*  He just saved his parents a lot of money.
*  So here's the thing though.
*  They're not doing that.
*  They did that.
*  They're not doing that for anybody who can kick a 53 year old.
*  I'll also give that to Joe.
*  Yeah.
*  You just phrased it, but you were right.
*  They did do it.
*  Yeah.
*  They did it once, but it's not something they do.
*  Get on the scale, bro.
*  You did it.
*  Get on the scale.
*  Get on the scale.
*  Fucking no way.
*  Let's go.
*  Hey.
*  So, Bronson, we're wrapping up.
*  Let's see what you're at.
*  I was trying to say this earlier.
*  Guys, we're gonna miss how I got to piss.
*  All right.
*  I remember doing a podcast with you.
*  Piss and then weigh in, Joe.
*  I did a podcast with you at the end of September, beginning of October,
*  and you looked like a fucking junkie.
*  Like on the streets.
*  That's a podcast you go to, Two Fat Cows podcast?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Wait a minute.
*  I'm sorry.
*  What's the name of our podcast?
*  Two Fat Cows.
*  It's regular cows, but fatter.
*  Two fat cows.
*  Two cows, one barn.
*  Two fat fucks.
*  But at the end of...
*  One barn.
*  Dude, at the end of October, he looked transformed.
*  He looked transformed.
*  Yeah.
*  At the end of October.
*  Yes.
*  It was one month.
*  One month he looked for everybody like...
*  He looked dramatically different.
*  Blunt, what are you wearing right now?
*  What are you wearing?
*  I weighed the other day.
*  It was 232.
*  What do you weigh?
*  Around...
*  Between 235 and 238.
*  Get off the scale.
*  For what?
*  We're telling you the right numbers.
*  Yeah.
*  The scale.
*  Well, tell us if those are the right numbers or not.
*  Let me see them.
*  Yeah.
*  Just by your foot.
*  Just weigh your foot right now.
*  Hold on, I'll tell you.
*  This thing's fucked.
*  Do you want to do a Trust Way?
*  How about this?
*  By the way, I added a fourth show for my special.
*  February 7th, fourth show.
*  10 o'clock show.
*  Oh, he's going to do plugs while he's gone.
*  Yeah, while he's gone.
*  Quickly.
*  Smoke, smoke.
*  Hey, New Orleans, Atlanta.
*  Hawaii, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, and Portland, Maine.
*  This is the rounding out the Jew tour.
*  How about this?
*  You ready for this?
*  What if Tom and I weigh in together?
*  Yeah.
*  And weigh under 7,000?
*  How about this?
*  If Tom and I weigh under 500 pounds.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to weigh in to 500 pounds.
*  250 each.
*  No, you're underweight.
*  We would definitely weigh under 500 pounds.
*  We weigh under 500.
*  Yeah, no, for sure.
*  Full clothes on, not peeing?
*  Hmm, that's a tough one.
*  Peeing is one pound.
*  498?
*  No, you have to weigh in to 450.
*  Yeah, we weigh over 450.
*  Over 450 together?
*  Well, yeah, that'd be 225 each.
*  And you don't?
*  We definitely weigh over that.
*  Oh, yeah, 475.
*  Pretty poor world tour.
*  475, pretty poor world tour.
*  You weighing in?
*  Yeah, he's weighing in.
*  Joe, what do you think Tom and I weigh in together?
*  Him on my back?
*  1,000 pounds.
*  I said 7,000, but it might be 1,000.
*  How do you still have those tits?
*  Jesus, Joe.
*  You look like the dude from fucking Guardians of the Galaxy.
*  I work out.
*  You're the underwear guy who works out.
*  Oh, you gotta get off first.
*  Yeah, you gotta get off first.
*  Make it zero, tap it.
*  Stupid idiot, you don't know where you're at.
*  Look at your core.
*  What is it?
*  205.
*  And what do you say you normally weigh?
*  I'd say I'm 205 right now because I've been eating a lot of carbs.
*  Wow.
*  He's been eating.
*  How come you don't have any chest tattoos?
*  This is getting really gay.
*  Try to get a tattoo right down the middle of your tits that says like, on it.
*  Is this the best shape you've ever been in?
*  He's bad.
*  He says he's been eating carbs.
*  No, no, no.
*  I mean, as a grown-up, this time period?
*  No, 10 pounds overweight right now.
*  So you think you were in better shape when you were younger?
*  Oh, 100%.
*  No, you should see the fucking Joe Rogan headshot on the Comedy Store wall.
*  He's a 140 pound weakling.
*  How much did you weigh when you got into comedy?
*  Joe, 205 exactly?
*  205.
*  Exactly.
*  I'm gonna go piss.
*  But I'm supposed to be like 195.
*  From 195.
*  What'd you get down to in October?
*  You posted something.
*  What?
*  194.
*  194.
*  I was pretty sure.
*  I'm still birth to Tom weighed in like 230.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Just for the bit.
*  I'll do it again, but just tell them.
*  What do you want?
*  What is believable that we could put you in?
*  Just say 232.
*  Not 228?
*  No, no, no.
*  That who wouldn't believe that.
*  Here's what we do.
*  You climb on.
*  I'm gonna get right behind you like I'm trying to make sure that you weigh in and you just lean on me.
*  That's how What's His Name did it?
*  Yeah.
*  What's his name?
*  Calvin Gaslim did that.
*  No, no, no.
*  The black guy.
*  No, Calvin did that.
*  The black guy who lost the fucking.
*  Daniel Cormier.
*  Daniel Cormier.
*  No, Calvin leaned on his manager's shoulder.
*  Yeah.
*  Do it.
*  Train, train, train, train, train, train, train and cheating, train and cheating.
*  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
*  What is it?
*  It's still going.
*  Because it's not really.
*  Because you're going to rest steady.
*  It's an error.
*  Because it's barely.
*  Yeah, you got to like rest steady.
*  Okay, we gotta do this right.
*  Make your shoulder hard.
*  Just be hard.
*  Try the chair.
*  Okay, he's back.
*  He's back.
*  No, I think he's one of the best guys I've ever met.
*  237.
*  237?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, oh.
*  Oh, jeez.
*  Oh my god.
*  Okay, he's cupped it.
*  He's cupped it.
*  Okay, get the hat off.
*  Get the hat off.
*  How much are you carrying?
*  Just one handful of coffee.
*  What's in between the fat fold and the unfold?
*  Tom, immediately out.
*  Let it zero out.
*  Okay, go, go, go.
*  What's the hat?
*  237.
*  It's the same weight.
*  It's the same weight.
*  237?
*  It's still both 0.4.
*  I know we lost challenge.
*  Wait a minute though.
*  Wait, but you have fully clothed.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Same, same, same, same.
*  It's a sweatsuit.
*  Well, hey guys, it is what it is.
*  Oh, shit.
*  These are great pictures.
*  This is great for your premiere date.
*  When is that date?
*  I can't say.
*  Tom, when's yours?
*  It's right near then.
*  So, are you guys trying to do something?
*  Are you trying to do a weight loss challenge?
*  Is that what I smell?
*  We should.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  Wait, what?
*  Can you bring up a BMI just on your computer?
*  Tom, can you hand me that CBD thing?
*  Thank you.
*  I'm totally in.
*  That BMI thing is all horseshit though.
*  No, Joe, it's horseshit for you because of muscle.
*  Can we agree that that's not their problem?
*  It's a different problem.
*  Bro, there's a lot of leg muscle in me.
*  For sure.
*  Hot spin, bro.
*  Hot spin.
*  Okay, what can be a weight loss challenge for you?
*  This is how this all started.
*  I had Tom on my podcast.
*  And then Bert went on and said, Tom's losing weight.
*  And you go, no way, I can lose more weight than him.
*  That's true.
*  Oh, is that how it started?
*  Yeah.
*  You were at my old, old apartment.
*  Tom, I interviewed at his hotel room.
*  He had just passed you and you were like, let's see what we can get down to.
*  I could definitely get into a weight loss challenge now.
*  I got nothing on the books but a tour.
*  205, I think is a real number.
*  If you do 205, you can get the belt.
*  You can still have the belt.
*  Bogey guys back then.
*  First one to 205.
*  Look at that.
*  How about not even a specific time period?
*  First one to 205.
*  Tom's got nothing except for Australia is going to be rough.
*  Australia.
*  No, but he's not really a drinker.
*  No, just kangaroos.
*  Kangaroos.
*  Eating it?
*  Yeah.
*  Tom can't say no to anything that he puts in front of him.
*  Australia.
*  Australian food's not that fattening.
*  They're very healthy over there.
*  Meat pies.
*  Meat pies?
*  205.
*  Are you doing Melbourne?
*  I am.
*  Great restaurants in Melbourne.
*  Yeah.
*  Great coffee too.
*  What's a legit coffee place?
*  Yeah.
*  Bring up a BMI.
*  I'm going to go over that.
*  I'll tell you what, man.
*  BMI is I'm obese right now.
*  Joe, we understand that the muscle goes on the outlier.
*  I know, but I'm just saying, just numbers-wise, I'm obese.
*  Yeah.
*  And then when I got to 195, I was just overweight.
*  Just made the cut.
*  Yeah.
*  I think 195 is like the borderline of obese.
*  I got to 194.
*  Okay.
*  So that's overweight.
*  Okay.
*  What would you guys be?
*  Burt, you're 61.
*  Morbid.
*  Tom, you're 48.
*  48?
*  Okay.
*  Don't forget, Tom's Peruvian.
*  Okay.
*  You're Peruvian or Argentinian?
*  Peruvian.
*  Peruvian.
*  I always thought half.
*  What is that?
*  What is the attitude of an Argentinian?
*  The aloofness and the kind of-
*  Better than now?
*  Yeah, that's Argentinian.
*  Jesus.
*  Okay.
*  No, that's it, right there.
*  Five, 10.
*  You're 5'11", right?
*  For real?
*  Six.
*  Come on, man.
*  Oh, Tom.
*  You know what?
*  Just to be fair, it calls both six.
*  Just his, I'll give him an inch.
*  Wow, I'm extremely obese.
*  I'm extremely obese.
*  Six, one, five, 11.
*  No, it's not.
*  Five, 11 and a half?
*  You're not six feet.
*  Yeah, six feet.
*  Does that say extremely obese or just obese?
*  I'm just obese.
*  There's no-
*  Oh, there's a white thing.
*  What am I?
*  Six, three?
*  You're not six feet.
*  You're healthy as fuck.
*  You're healthy as fuck, Ari.
*  Where's the weight part?
*  At the top.
*  This one ends at 215.
*  Oh my God.
*  It ends at 215.
*  You're at 215.
*  For that chart.
*  One, eight, one, eight, what?
*  Here's the-
*  Okay, there we go.
*  Okay, here we go.
*  It's an extreme, extreme-
*  Six, three.
*  Okay, that definitely took it off.
*  We should do a bodybuilding challenge.
*  Six, thank you.
*  Do you really want to do that?
*  Nope.
*  You can get hurt.
*  We were talking about doing a power weightlifting-
*  I'm in.
*  What's green?
*  What's green?
*  A weightlifting-
*  Normal weight?
*  A power weightlifting challenge.
*  Remember that?
*  Yeah.
*  Who can go from what you can do now to the most weight?
*  Who can actually do that?
*  I mean, I'm not a weightlifter.
*  I'm a weightlifter.
*  I'm a weightlifter.
*  Who can add on the most weight?
*  That's a great way to get hurt.
*  Let's do that.
*  No.
*  You could get really fucked up, man.
*  Let's get really hurt.
*  No, I'm up for, I'm always up for weight loss challenges.
*  The reason, what happened to me with 205, not that I could have gotten there, I'm not
*  going to say I could have gotten there during Sober October.
*  You had a stroke.
*  But is it, I become obsessive-compulsive about it, and I can't focus-
*  On what you have to do.
*  You had to do a special.
*  You had to do a special.
*  So I was like, I got to disconnect.
*  When you got a special, it's like all hands on deck.
*  I got nothing on the books other than the Bertie Burt World Tour.
*  What?
*  What?
*  Bertie Burt World Tour?
*  Does that start soon?
*  January 30th in Vermont, Burlington, first time there.
*  How do you get tickets for this?
*  Go to BertBurtBurt.com.
*  Thanks, Joe.
*  Pleasant.
*  Second show's added.
*  Second show's added.
*  I could get into a weight loss challenge.
*  I could really get into a weight loss challenge.
*  Do you think you could get shredded?
*  Do you get down like 205?
*  I wish I had weighed myself.
*  I wish I had weighed myself at other times.
*  I've got an idea.
*  I've got an idea.
*  I record my spells for February 7th and 8th.
*  I will, at the end of that special, start gaining weight.
*  First one to pass me wins.
*  I love this idea.
*  I will eat for real for it.
*  What?
*  186.
*  Damn, look how slim you are.
*  That's when I met my wife.
*  Damn, you got those fuck handles.
*  She signed on for a raw deal.
*  Yeah, no, it's called a penny stock.
*  I will gain weight.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Google skinny Tom Segura.
*  Have you ever seen Tom's jawline?
*  He looks like fucking Magnum P.I. when he was skinny.
*  Seventh grade?
*  Bro, I'm telling you right now, a very, very attractive man.
*  I believe you.
*  Find, skinny, Tommy, where can we find that pig?
*  You know you know where you can find that.
*  Actually, and then Google fat.
*  Look at this fucking guy.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Look at his pouty lips.
*  Look at you.
*  Wow.
*  His, I might have gotten a scar on a plunge.
*  You like that, Ari, come on.
*  I'm standing up like a master.
*  Yeah.
*  You look good.
*  Masterbate standing up.
*  You look good back then.
*  Yeah.
*  Who's that guy on the left pretending to be you?
*  Look at that.
*  Who's that fucking guy?
*  Who's that fucking guy?
*  That's a fake you.
*  Oh, he's got your t-shirt.
*  That's not my shirt.
*  That's not my shirt.
*  By the way, how great is that title for an album?
*  What is that t-shirt?
*  No idea.
*  That title's great.
*  I remember that CD.
*  Oh, that's back in the early 2000s, right?
*  2010.
*  Oh shit.
*  Yeah.
*  2010.
*  Look at you.
*  Look at you.
*  That's a good looking Tom right there.
*  That's the one I fell in love with.
*  Yeah, look at that sweetie.
*  He blooper'd in and out.
*  I remember exactly when that was.
*  When was that?
*  That was on Russell Peters' show on Showtime.
*  You got a fat dimple on your chin, on your cheek.
*  2009.
*  So the thing about weight loss is if you guys just do the weight loss thing and just get
*  down and wait for a day or a couple days, that doesn't help anybody.
*  It doesn't.
*  No.
*  What if you could keep it off?
*  That's the key.
*  Could you keep it off?
*  What is your thing?
*  What keeps you eating?
*  What's your vice?
*  For me, it's pasta.
*  It's carbs.
*  When I eat a lot of carbs, it's just like, fuck, I can't help myself sometimes.
*  Yeah, I would say it's probably carb related.
*  I like rice, bread.
*  Pasta.
*  Pasta, yeah.
*  I love it.
*  I'm not a crazy sugar sweet tooth.
*  I'm a glutton too.
*  I eat and I'm stuffed and I just keep eating.
*  I don't really do that as much anymore.
*  I used to do that all the time.
*  I used to think that's how meals were completed, like every meal.
*  That's like, I would say, at my worst.
*  But I don't think I really eat like that most of the time now.
*  But I don't, you know, I'm not like weighing out everything as much as I should.
*  So you could just cut back your portions.
*  I could, yeah.
*  And you'd probably still be fine.
*  You probably wouldn't feel like you're denying yourself anything.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  That's how I always feel.
*  I always feel like too, I'll get on a good meal plan and it's just about the discipline
*  of sticking to it and then, you know, start doing it less.
*  What are you doing now?
*  Are you going to go with your clothes on?
*  How much did you pee?
*  Wow.
*  1.2.
*  Yeah, you're, I understand my problem with weight loss.
*  I don't understand yours.
*  Yours is booze.
*  Yeah, mine is booze.
*  Yours is booze, obviously.
*  Yours is not a booze thing, right?
*  No, it's not.
*  Booze is the things that booze invites into my life after midnight.
*  Late night food is rough.
*  But also the empty calories of booze.
*  Empty calories of booze is what it is.
*  Seven calories per gram.
*  You lost like fucking 30 pounds by not drinking.
*  Yeah.
*  What is yours?
*  Yeah, it's food.
*  Yeah, so if you lost 30 pounds from not drinking, you'd be 207.
*  You're on 205's door.
*  You're just knocking at it.
*  Yeah, but I don't know what, like Tom, because Tom does not, like we've had dinner a bunch
*  of times.
*  It's not like he's like a gluttonous eater.
*  I bet you have had dinner a bunch of times tonight.
*  I ate with Ralphie, man, and he would fucking, he would like jaw drop you on food.
*  It was crazy.
*  It was crazy.
*  We went to Katana once and he ordered like everything and then it was like, oh, that's
*  great.
*  We're all going to eat.
*  He goes, no, no, that's my order.
*  Now you guys put in your order.
*  Dude, that's my, the sushi, the Burt's sushi experience with Ralphie is my favorite story
*  because of the whole thing is that Burt is like, you're an opening act at the time.
*  Yeah, I was opening for him.
*  And Ralphie is inviting Burt and his wife and like Burt and, you know, Burt's or Leanne
*  or Ralphie's wife, they're all having dinner.
*  Ralphie's paying all the time.
*  Like four meals, four meals.
*  And they're in Hawaii.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Right?
*  Oh, sorry, Bahamas.
*  Bahamas, yeah.
*  And then for like one, the next night, Burt's like, I'm going to cover like a respectful
*  thing.
*  You know, you've bought all these dinners.
*  I'm taking you to dinner tonight.
*  And they go to sushi.
*  Take Ralphie.
*  And Ralphie starts ordering and they're bringing boats out like the boats with all the sushi.
*  And you guys are jumping in and you don't realize it's all for him?
*  Well, he's just ordering it like he's just ordering.
*  He's just ordering.
*  And I know I'm paying for it, but he's just ordering.
*  He's like, I got this player.
*  And I was like, all right, cool.
*  And he just kept ordering and ordering and I'm eating and I'm drinking and then keep
*  going.
*  I like you telling the story better than me.
*  It makes me laugh because Ralphie had treated you guys.
*  Just like four meals.
*  And then you're just like, I've been in this position before too, where somebody is like,
*  you know, you want to be like, you know what, like I'm a fucking man and I'm in your, you
*  know, I'm going to, I'm going to buy dinner.
*  Now tonight's my night, but you're not in a position to take this bill.
*  So like they bring the bill and it's a fucking four figure bill.
*  This is an over a thousand dollar sushi experience.
*  And then you insist on paying and Leanne goes, how much is it?
*  They go, go fuck yourself.
*  That's how much it is.
*  And she goes, you don't talk to me like that.
*  They go, go fuck yourself again.
*  Don't talk to me.
*  And Ralphie goes, I'll play.
*  Should have just let me pay for a player.
*  And she goes, why are you talking to me like this?
*  And I'm looking at like a fucking $1,500 bill, 1200, I think it was $1,200 or $1,500.
*  I didn't have the money in the bank account to pay for the tip.
*  But it's like that because I fucking, I think why the story always hits me is because I
*  feel myself doing this.
*  I would do the same thing.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I would do the same thing.
*  Ralphie was so generous.
*  Like he just was so generous that you felt, I don't, I don't want you to think I'm taking
*  advantage of you.
*  I want you to know that I'm your friend and I want to pay for things too.
*  Motherfucker.
*  Yeah.
*  That was the bit.
*  And then Ralphie goes, oh, Leanne's irate at me.
*  Storms off.
*  Ralphie goes, I'll play.
*  We go win it back on Blackjack.
*  Took a thousand dollars out, maybe $2,000 out of the bank machine.
*  Go to roulette.
*  Put it on black.
*  Hits red.
*  Oh, all I remember is we were the couple in the lobby fighting.
*  Like it was so bad.
*  You can't even like save for the hotel.
*  And Ralphie walked past me and it was not a drop in the bucket.
*  It's rough.
*  It was $2,000.
*  And he just saw me fighting with Leanne.
*  He goes, Oh, miss Leanne, give him a break.
*  He tried his best.
*  He tried his best.
*  I'll see you on the plane, playboy.
*  And then Ralphie was on the plane.
*  You know, so my whole part of the story that I remember the most, Ralphie read a book on
*  a flight from Miami to L.A.
*  He read the whole fucking book.
*  I've never read a fucking book in five hours.
*  He was like a really like he read a book.
*  I remember sitting next to me, read a book.
*  That's the crazy part of the story.
*  I remember.
*  Damn.
*  He was very generous.
*  You were broke.
*  Yeah, we were broke, man.
*  That's Bert.
*  That's Bert.
*  I like to roll the dice.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't become a comedian if you don't like rolling the dice, man.
*  I don't think so.
*  I'd be crazy.
*  You're a comic.
*  You're a little crazy.
*  You have to be.
*  You have to be a little crazy.
*  And if you're not crazy, I don't I don't know if I want to know you.
*  Meaning like, you know, speaking of books, do you guys read any during the Super October?
*  Oh, dude, so many good books.
*  You didn't do any of that, did you?
*  Dude, I fucking read like five.
*  You didn't do it.
*  I did.
*  I did.
*  You did it.
*  I started reading three books.
*  OK.
*  I went all audio.
*  I started reading and I'm like, I don't have time for this.
*  It's never going to happen.
*  And then I said, 500.
*  I'm going to have to pay a fine.
*  Five hundred, I realized immediately was like, oh, this is like this isn't just like, OK,
*  and also we found the pages like that.
*  That number should be 200.
*  No, it should have been five hundred.
*  We should have had a penalty if you should have been the whole thing.
*  It's five hundred pages.
*  If we had a penalty.
*  So I was thinking to myself, I just don't have the fucking time.
*  It was a lot.
*  You have to really commit to reading books.
*  I had to really work hard.
*  I think I'm the only one who did it.
*  You did it.
*  Yeah, you did it.
*  Yeah.
*  The classes weren't like I didn't make fucking, you know, fucking.
*  Khan's Film Festival classes.
*  But the classes were the best thing about gun shooting was the funny shit.
*  Terran, Terran, tactical, Terran, tactical.
*  That was awesome.
*  That was really fun.
*  Yeah.
*  That whole setup is amazing.
*  Like learning how to learning how to really shoot correctly.
*  That looked cool.
*  You should know how long you in town for the night.
*  OK.
*  You leave tomorrow.
*  When are you back?
*  I don't know.
*  Why don't you jet set back and forth like a fucking.
*  I'm going to come more often.
*  International man of mystery that you are.
*  I'm going to come more often.
*  I do want to do, one, I want to do your Spanish podcast, Tom.
*  Here's us.
*  Bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  I want to try.
*  I want to try to get by in that.
*  And then, yeah, I'm going to cut like three or four, four or five times a year.
*  I'm going to come to you.
*  Shooting bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  It looks cool as shit.
*  It's fun, man.
*  It was funny shit.
*  Was it really?
*  Was it really funny shit?
*  It's really fun.
*  Bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  They didn't hit you with anything like a child crossing the street kind of thing.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  You had to hit everything.
*  Yeah, well, it's all metal.
*  You know, you're just shooting at metal.
*  Taron's so sick, man.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  I'm saying like in Please Academy, there were these things.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  They were like, don't shoot that.
*  Do shoot this.
*  Something would pop up.
*  But that's advanced stuff, man.
*  We're babies.
*  It's really cool.
*  It looked cool.
*  That place almost burned down.
*  I know.
*  It got real close.
*  Real close.
*  The fire got right up at the doorway there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That place is, that's an experience, man.
*  Like you should do it.
*  That is really cool.
*  It's fun.
*  That's one of those.
*  I wish I still lived in LA when you guys were like doing fun shit like that.
*  I'm like, I wish I was there.
*  You should have a place out here, man.
*  You should do both.
*  It's not a question of place.
*  It's like on the road and also like.
*  Come on.
*  Good point.
*  We miss you.
*  Tons of stand up spots.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know what?
*  You come out with us, Ari.
*  Bro, you can have tons of stand up spots out here.
*  Are we friends again?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, good.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I forgot you drugged him.
*  I forgot that.
*  Dude, I'll tell you right now.
*  Is your wife over it?
*  No, no, my kids aren't over it either.
*  And that really breaks my heart.
*  Your kids aren't.
*  That's what really breaks my heart.
*  You should buy them stuff.
*  You should buy them stuff.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  Let it breathe.
*  Let it breathe until they, one day they find you're funny and they're like.
*  That might not happen.
*  You should buy them stuff.
*  I told Joe in the green room, I decided to forgive Ari so that the people I hate know
*  how much I really hate Ari.
*  I told him, I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I told him, I hate, know how much I really hate them.
*  Oh, I like that.
*  That was a good one.
*  I like what you said.
*  Good.
*  Do stuff out of spite.
*  No.
*  Yeah, but it's like to let people know.
*  Like this guy drugged me in front of my kids and I still forgive him.
*  What do you mean in front of your kids?
*  What do you mean in front of your kids?
*  That's not a part that mattered.
*  Don't, let's not talk about it.
*  Let's not talk about it.
*  You have kids, it's a part.
*  Yeah, we're good.
*  Me and you are good.
*  I had to come to a moment.
*  I had a spiritual healer come to my house to clear my energy.
*  I talked to Tom about it.
*  That's right.
*  And then she cleared our new house for all its bad energy.
*  And then she said, I see some darkness in you.
*  Oh boy.
*  I told Joe about it.
*  I was dealing with darkness in my head about just OCD shit.
*  And I went, all right, fuck, what is it?
*  And she picked you out in a heartbeat.
*  And I went, I am not, I haven't forgiven him yet.
*  He probably listens to the podcast.
*  No, I know.
*  I called you and you're like, I'm over it.
*  And then I'm like, you're still not over it.
*  I wasn't over it.
*  Do you know how many spiritual healers listen to this podcast?
*  A lot.
*  So what?
*  She said, Ari Schaefer.
*  And he was like, yeah.
*  I don't know how you say it.
*  It's Ari Schaefer.
*  She said, did you do something to Burt Chrysler?
*  She said, it's, if you, I'm forgetting the exact words.
*  I know because I'm a little strokey, but, but, um, something about bringing Jay Moore
*  up.
*  It was about, yeah.
*  Blue fuse.
*  I'm going to fucking deal with that tomorrow.
*  It was, it was what?
*  It was, uh, if you, if you love him, you got to fix, help fix his karma.
*  This bad karma for him.
*  And I thought I do.
*  I can't, I can't write you off.
*  I couldn't think straight.
*  Every time I was on a hike, I was like, my girlfriend was like, what am I fucking my
*  friend?
*  I'm still not friends with them.
*  I don't know.
*  It's fucking hard.
*  It was, she said, if you, is he, you got to fix his karma if you care about him.
*  And I was like, I do.
*  I can't not have conversations with him.
*  Your conversations are too important to me.
*  Seeing you in New York when I go to New York and spending time with you is too important
*  to me.
*  And I know you, I know you so well.
*  And I know that you're, I said to someone, I think I may have said to Tom, I say, he's
*  a great guy.
*  He's just a bad person.
*  And it's like, it's like, he's not, he didn't, he didn't.
*  And it was like, you didn't mean to, you never meant to hurt me at all.
*  And I was like, and I talked to Joe and Tom about this ad nauseam, but I was like, I can't,
*  I can't, man, I'm not in a place to look for new fucking friends.
*  I got him.
*  He's one of my friends.
*  You don't want to think this beautiful about this.
*  We're here in 2019 in any other business.
*  If you drugged a peer and you did so publicly and then it was discussed publicly and yet
*  you were on my podcast two weeks later, we were howling about it.
*  We got high.
*  We were smoking weed and just laughing about the fact that you drugged him.
*  It was hard because it was serious, but it was also super not serious at the same time.
*  We were having a good time.
*  We were having a good time talking about it.
*  And then we were also talking about how no one's kicked you out of the comedy community.
*  It was never even a thought.
*  There's no, not a second, like where you're not getting booked anywhere, not a second
*  where you're, you're ostracized.
*  It's like, this is the last frontier for savages.
*  This is the last frontier for people that are doing wild, crazy, stupid shit.
*  And that is one of the wildest, craziest, stupidest fucking things you do is drug someone
*  when they don't know you're drugging them.
*  It's like a fucking, it is the line stepping of all line stepping.
*  And we're like, ah, I talked to Joey.
*  Joey Diaz had the funniest fucking take on it.
*  Joey Diaz called me up.
*  He goes, listen to me, this fucking Bert and Ari thing.
*  He goes, Ari's family.
*  He goes, he's here.
*  He's here.
*  We're not going anywhere.
*  We're not getting rid of them.
*  I go, we're not getting rid of them.
*  He goes, exactly.
*  I go, I'm not saying we are.
*  He goes, I know you're not.
*  I go, okay.
*  And he goes, look, he fucked up.
*  I go, okay, he fucked up.
*  I'm not saying anything.
*  Like Joey was like arguing.
*  Like he calls you up.
*  He'll call you up arguing.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Like he's arguing with somebody else.
*  Right away.
*  We're fucking, he's family.
*  Out of the gate.
*  I'm like, I definitely agree with you.
*  I'm like, I'm not, I'm not arguing you here.
*  He called me like two days after.
*  And he was like, I just answered the phone and he goes, you gotta forgive him.
*  And I didn't say a word.
*  And I was like, I go, I'm going through some shit right now.
*  I go, go through your shit, cocksucker.
*  Do what you gotta do.
*  You gotta forgive him.
*  He's a good guy.
*  You know that.
*  You know that.
*  Now he's got a bit about it.
*  Yeah, now he's got a bit.
*  I saw his bit in New York.
*  It was killer.
*  It's killer.
*  It's killer.
*  I thought we might, I thought, I was like, oh, we're going to do this podcast.
*  I was like, I thought we might talk about this.
*  I kind of wrote down some feelings.
*  Oh boy.
*  You're lying right now.
*  I'm not, I'm not.
*  You're so lying.
*  I'm not.
*  No, he's not.
*  Also, I smuggled some fruit in, a felony.
*  If you guys want some granadillas.
*  Ew, don't say that.
*  Granadillas.
*  Don't tell anybody.
*  Don't show the fruit.
*  Okay.
*  That's a lie.
*  We're just joking, folks.
*  Any DEA agents or who would it be?
*  Oh shit.
*  Agriculture?
*  Yeah, agriculture people.
*  If you tell me they're all in Spanish, I'm going to fucking jump over this table right
*  now.
*  Can you play this theme?
*  Yeah.
*  How are you in Spanish?
*  All right.
*  Can you translate?
*  I gotta pee, man.
*  What?
*  I gotta pee.
*  Go ahead.
*  Okay.
*  Querido Brent.
*  My dearest Brent.
*  Fucking cunt.
*  Me importa la amistad.
*  Me importa mas amistad.
*  Ahot que.
*  Can you just let him read what you wrote and translate it?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Better move.
*  I double spaced it.
*  Good call.
*  I might have had a misspelling or two, so you might have like...
*  Oh, fuck me.
*  What is it?
*  Before this goes viral, can I just mention the Birdie Boy World Tour?
*  He says, uh, all right, dear Brent, what's imp...
*  Our friendship is important.
*  Friendship is more important now that...
*  Don't pull out that fruit.
*  Tom is occupied with the fried pizza.
*  This is as important to me as Tom is with deep fried pizza.
*  With deep fried pizza.
*  Great.
*  It's more important to me than...
*  Hot damn fruit.
*  Don't show it on camera.
*  That's a felony.
*  More important to me than Joe's obsession with killing animals.
*  Defenseless animals.
*  They have horns.
*  Beautiful animals in the woods.
*  They'll fuck you up with those horns.
*  Alright, there you go.
*  Let's see if I can remember this.
*  Just speak from the heart.
*  Just say it.
*  You don't have to read it.
*  Just tell him how you feel.
*  Friendship is more important to me than anything.
*  Even more important than...
*  As important...
*  Tom is deep fried pizza.
*  More important than Tom...
*  Than Joe is killing animals.
*  More important than...
*  Oh, some of this is really mean.
*  Don't do that.
*  Just put that down.
*  Just tell him you're sorry.
*  But I wrote some funny stuff.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Friendship is more important to me than Eliza's...
*  Oh, wow.
*  I'm gonna fucking fall.
*  Don't do this.
*  I would not read that, Ari.
*  Let your friends tell you.
*  Don't do this.
*  Ari, we're your friends.
*  We love you.
*  We love you.
*  Listen, look at the face of Brody.
*  I wrote one funny...
*  Call him David for happiness.
*  Living without you would be worse than...
*  Tony Hinchcliffe living without the mural above his bed of...
*  Him blowing Joe Rogan as Jeff Ross fucks him in the ass.
*  I don't think he has that.
*  He does have that.
*  I've seen it in his apartment.
*  Who painted it?
*  So you read this in Spanish and you pulled the plug.
*  I saw it was coming up.
*  Hey, let me tell you something.
*  I didn't know the fallback was gonna happen.
*  The point is all I wanted to do was...
*  I like playing pranks.
*  I will do what you said, Joe.
*  It's just speaking from the heart.
*  I like playing pranks.
*  I like doing fun stuff.
*  And I thought the same thing I do with Louis Gomez where I'm like...
*  He had this great announcement for Skank Fest and was like,
*  And I'm gonna do it by promoting it.
*  And I thought I'll give you what you love doing,
*  which is great content for your fans.
*  I know you're never gonna release that podcast,
*  but it was the best podcast, top 20 podcasts of all time of any podcast.
*  And I thought I'll give that to you.
*  I'll have a fun time with my friend.
*  I didn't know all the fallback was gonna happen.
*  I didn't know your friends, your kids were gonna come home and say...
*  That I got raped.
*  That you got raped by Ari.
*  Which I don't know why they...
*  Here's what I don't know.
*  Why do you want to say that?
*  You have better stamina and strength than me.
*  Why they wouldn't think that you would rape me?
*  That's a good point.
*  Kids are intuitive.
*  Maybe they saw something in you that I don't see.
*  A fanciness or something.
*  But I don't know.
*  This is good.
*  Read it.
*  Go back to reading.
*  The point is this.
*  Go back to reading it.
*  I wanted to have fun.
*  I thought I have a prank that I'm like...
*  I thought the prank first.
*  I'm gonna dose somebody in a podcast.
*  I'm gonna give them acid or molly.
*  And I was like who can I do it to?
*  I thought of Louis Gomez first.
*  But I was like he's an unknown.
*  He's worthless.
*  And I don't like him that much.
*  He's a good guy.
*  And then I thought it has to be a good friend.
*  You can't do it to a semi-friend.
*  It has to be someone who parties.
*  So it can't be these two faggots.
*  And then it hit me.
*  The fucking the machine.
*  I know the machine.
*  So I was like I will do that with Bert.
*  That was my thought.
*  And I know people are telling you that I thought you were weak.
*  That's the furthest thing from the truth.
*  I thought you were fun.
*  But if you forgive me I won't do this.
*  Sometimes people do something and they have it in their head that it's gonna be okay.
*  And they don't understand how other people are gonna perceive it.
*  It's not that they did it with bad intentions.
*  It's just that they fucked up.
*  And I didn't think about you having to fucking run interference with me against your wife.
*  It's like...
*  I'll tell you right now.
*  The biggest thing that fucked me up about it.
*  The biggest thing was that...
*  It's an amazing fruit.
*  It's illegal.
*  When it happened I knew I was gonna have to take care of you.
*  I knew all the implications of what was about to trickle down.
*  And that was the one thing I was like why would you make my life more complicated?
*  And I told you on the phone...
*  And by the way no one said this other than me.
*  I said this to myself and I've said this to Joe a million times.
*  Is that moniker of like you think I'm weak.
*  It's my biggest fucking thing of people to go in my head.
*  And I would go...
*  I know Joe doesn't say that.
*  I know Tom doesn't say that.
*  And I know you don't say that.
*  But in that moment I was like is he doing what these enemies do to me?
*  Where he just thinks oh he's some fucking weak comic.
*  He just rips his shirt off.
*  Taking advantage of your good nature.
*  Right. And that was the thing.
*  And when I was on the phone with you I was in Connecticut.
*  I was with Shane in the car.
*  And I told you that and you said oh my god I would never...
*  Because I share that with you privately.
*  I share it publicly now.
*  But share it both with you privately.
*  Your response I knew you didn't...
*  I knew that's why you didn't do that.
*  And I was like alright I can get past this.
*  Which was a big thing for me.
*  And then it took a little bit to just go...
*  Still mad though?
*  No.
*  At a certain point I thought
*  it's just a reward.
*  Does Ari bring more to my life
*  than that one stupid fucking moment?
*  Right?
*  And I said yeah he does.
*  You bring a lot to my life Ari.
*  You don't know that.
*  I don't share that maybe enough with you.
*  But you bring a lot to my life.
*  And all you guys do.
*  Our friendship means a lot more to me.
*  Maybe that means to you guys sometimes.
*  No it means a lot to me too man.
*  This podcast that we do.
*  These regular podcasts we do.
*  Some of my favorite.
*  The chat thread.
*  The fucking text thread is fun.
*  It's fucking awesome.
*  Oh my god.
*  Don't eat that. It's illegal.
*  The agriculture is going to come here.
*  They have a helicopter.
*  You skipped every other word.
*  Don't eat. Helicopter. Here. Agriculture.
*  It's contagious.
*  It's contagious.
*  Both of these guys were
*  I don't know. I have to share this.
*  Both of these guys were very very valuable to me.
*  In that moment where I was super vulnerable.
*  Both of them had a moment where it was fun.
*  And then a moment where they called me
*  and they were concerned.
*  Yeah when you told me during the podcast
*  My first dude in the podcast
*  I'm like what happened?
*  Oh just wait.
*  That's when I knew it was serious.
*  I still thought it was fun until it was like
*  and then Tom was like what the fuck is wrong with you?
*  And I was like wait is this serious?
*  No other business.
*  No other business.
*  If you were working in HR
*  at a fucking network
*  and you guys went on a Christmas party
*  and you drug somebody.
*  That's the end of your fucking career man.
*  Free drugs.
*  Free drugs to someone.
*  Yeah but they didn't want it.
*  Yeah when you told me afterwards
*  you were like oh he's really fucked up over it.
*  I also wanted really badly for you guys to make up.
*  I spoke to both of you.
*  Everyone. Both of you.
*  Yeah Tom called me and was like
*  I called you every day trying to like
*  You called me every day.
*  And Tom was like hey I saw you call them.
*  I just knew it was wrong
*  for me to answer because I didn't know what to say to you.
*  And I wasn't right in the head yet.
*  And I was like
*  I'm really angry but I'm not mad
*  at him. Does that make sense?
*  And I was like I feel victimized
*  but I know I'm not a victim. I know that this is going to be fine.
*  I call Whitney.
*  I talked to Whitney about it.
*  What did she say?
*  Call the police?
*  No no no. We were in the green
*  backstage of the comedy store.
*  I'm like do you think that's the only felony we ever committed?
*  Hello?
*  Hey put that down. Don't film it.
*  We were in the backstage of the comedy store
*  or in the back bar and we saw David Spade and Whitney
*  and I was on Hi-O-Molly and I was
*  You were having a great time!
*  I was having a blast.
*  And you saw David Spade there and you're like oh I've got a great story
*  for David Spade. I've always been sexually attracted to him
*  and this is my moment.
*  I went over David Spade.
*  I can hear you say that now.
*  When I heard you say that on the podcast I got mad at you.
*  I was like it's so
*  fucked up man. It's so fucked up.
*  There's so many complex moments in this
*  where you're right. You're totally right.
*  David Spade was back there and me and you were back there and I was like I got
*  mad at him. He brought it up on his show and he's like ah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
*  And even the podcast
*  I was like I was conflicted because I go
*  this is super
*  compelling content.
*  You saw it during the podcast!
*  Fuck I'm so mad at you for doing this but I see it now.
*  This is the best podcast.
*  But I was like and in retrospect
*  I was like I can't release it.
*  I don't want to be the guy that people come on my show
*  and they go I'm going to fucking drug him in that time.
*  No it's a one time only thing.
*  But I talked to Whitney and Whitney was like
*  Whitney
*  oddly enough said exactly what Joe said
*  and said this is really
*  it's not right man. It's not right.
*  You shouldn't be drugging people
*  in front of their kids. She was like I'm sorry
*  I didn't say that to you in the
*  green in the thing. I didn't know how you felt.
*  And that's how Joe felt. That's also how Tom felt.
*  Is that like I didn't know how I felt
*  so I brought all these energies of like
*  I got drugged and then everything's
*  on the table and everyone's like I got to figure out your
*  fucking emotions. And I hadn't figured
*  them out yet.
*  I got to be honest with you man
*  when you lean on friends and you come out
*  of a place like that you go
*  in a weird way I was like
*  I feel a lot
*  closer to the four of us after
*  that and I'm like I'm definitely not
*  You drugged us all together.
*  You brought us closer. In a metaphorical way I did.
*  And the funny part is I was
*  like I was like he wanted
*  to kill SoberOctober.
*  But now he's got to do it for the rest of his fucking
*  life. Cause he
*  didn't win. We're always
*  going to do SoberOctober. No. No.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Every year Ari.
*  Every fucking year.
*  Now you drugged him in front of his kids. You drugged me in front of my
*  children. First of all
*  what drugs? It's MDMA.
*  You're acting like some roofie.
*  Fucked up his brain for like weeks. Yeah.
*  I'm still doing the deal with OCD shit.
*  I will
*  You literally spiraled him.
*  And I think you could do this. You could
*  chloroform him. That would be a fucking
*  You can get that online. That's a drugging.
*  That would be a good prank.
*  I will say to anyone at home
*  doing MDMA
*  your friend is 5-HTP
*  I told Burt but he was not in a
*  place where he was going to trust anything I would say.
*  That has 5-HTP in it.
*  5-HTP will equalize your mood.
*  And I meant to bring it with me. And I didn't.
*  And I fucked up hard. I pride myself
*  on dosing people the right way.
*  And um. It's like you learned nothing.
*  During the podcast
*  I remember this too. I was like
*  we were feeling like really good.
*  We were feeling really good. I did feel
*  really good during the podcast. It was a fun time.
*  We were watching Sunset
*  over Joey Diaz's head.
*  Bro there's nothing more beautiful
*  on my deathbed. When you get that
*  6 seconds of memories through your life
*  I hope I see Joey Diaz like
*  Jesus Christ like Buddha. Just going
*  Listen cocksucker.
*  If you would have had a stroke it would have already happened.
*  You're going to be fine.
*  I didn't know you were freaking out. You handled
*  it like a professional. I didn't have much of an
*  option there Captain. No but you were like
*  You handled like a pro.
*  That's what drugs do is they take you over.
*  Yeah.
*  Can't wait to see Joey's paper. So are we going to do this
*  next year? Yeah.
*  So in January. January?
*  Do you want to. Let's do a mid-month.
*  Let's do a mid-year month.
*  And do a fun. Here's what I'm
*  saying. Yes I agree with that. That's way easier
*  to do it I think in like
*  June or something. Like a non-touring
*  month. Yeah but sober October is what
*  we've been calling it. We can do that in October.
*  I'll do it in October again as well. I don't
*  mind. We could do it anytime. Do you like doing
*  gigs as much when you can't
*  smoke a little bit. Have a little drink. By the way I haven't
*  smoked pot in 16
*  days. Why? I've been in
*  Colombia. Oh in Colombia. It sucked doing
*  Europe without being able to just. Yeah there's always
*  giving me a reason why you won't do it.
*  But I'm saying October, Yankee, playoffs
*  games. I love it. You love what?
*  I love sober October. You love the month
*  that you love just doing it. I love having an excuse
*  not to get drunk every fucking night.
*  Let's do that in January. Let's stop right there.
*  Are you really doing that every night? Getting drunk every night?
*  No not every night but on the road
*  when especially
*  you go to Boston. You do a show in Boston. Oh you do this thing
*  though. You do this thing where you invite everybody to a bar
*  afterwards. You're wild.
*  I like that. You are wild.
*  You're the only one who goes out with your friends. Tom has a
*  general disdain for fans. He won't touch them or
*  look at them. He thinks they're beneath them.
*  But like you actually go out with them.
*  We used to do photos with everybody after shows.
*  When I first started doing shows with the Ice House
*  you were the most generous human being.
*  You'd sit in line.
*  Guys would be like, Joe I want to talk to you one real quick second about
*  the Ice House. I was happy to do that.
*  Chicago Theater. I did Chicago Theater.
*  3,700 people for two shows.
*  Line it up. They would line up two levels.
*  Yeah hours. Hours taking pictures of people.
*  But it got weird.
*  It got too weird. And too many people.
*  The podcast got to this
*  weird strange space where people would come to me
*  with like ten page letters
*  and proposals of things that we needed to do
*  together and they just wanted too much of you.
*  And I just
*  realized I got to step away from that.
*  I'm not there. I like to name
*  a bar. Give them good business.
*  Well you also like to get fucked up. You know. So like you
*  after the show want to get fucked up
*  and party. I'd still go out during
*  sober October and hang out. Just not drink.
*  I'm saying
*  I would have a lot more fun with this
*  if we did it in January.
*  It starts up
*  I'll do it this January. I don't give a fuck.
*  We could do it in January. We don't
*  have to do sober October.
*  Okay. We could do January. Let's go to Australia
*  though. That's fine.
*  We're doing this like in a couple
*  days? No. No. No. Next year.
*  Jesus.
*  January would be
*  a lot. October is just like. You guys don't live in New York.
*  My fucking Mickey Mantle brain
*  was like I'm in. Unless I can do it.
*  Let's just wait. Let's get to 2005. January is World
*  Carnivore Month. That's one thing
*  that I've thought about doing
*  is there's a lot of people that are just eating
*  meat. Only meat? Nothing but meat. Yeah.
*  Carnivore died. I did that once for a month and I
*  didn't shit. At all?
*  At all. For a month?
*  Yeah. I mean
*  the only vegetables I had were
*  garnished. Like sauteed mushrooms on top
*  of a steak. Did you do it on purpose? Yeah.
*  Yeah? Yeah. You didn't shit for a month?
*  I shit for the first like week or so
*  and then like once every like
*  week after that. Jesus.
*  What were those shits like when they came out?
*  For your World Carnivore.
*  Like they were old.
*  Like they were rotten. Way opposite
*  from what I got now. Like they were dried out
*  rotten inside of you. Like cadaver
*  and fucking cancer lungs just shitting
*  at you. Cancer lungs.
*  It was a problem. Like cancer
*  lungs coming out of your asshole. Jesus
*  man. What? Fucking I'm going to fall asleep.
*  Let's figure this out and wrap this up.
*  Have a drink outside. It's like 1.35.
*  I like that. I will say we can do it in January.
*  I'll personally have a lot more fun with
*  it as a New Yorker. October is the
*  honestly probably the best drinking
*  month of the year so it's extra hard for me.
*  But if we do it in January it's great
*  and if we have a real competition it would be
*  even better. The problem
*  with real competition is I'm crazy.
*  Really? I have a real problem.
*  I can't make videos on but something you can actually
*  do. The thing I loved about what we did
*  last month was that or last October
*  was that it was I felt very
*  untethered from
*  the group and competition wise. So it was
*  fun for me. Let's plan it out.
*  The classes were fun. I enjoyed
*  doing. Separate thing. That was the most fun.
*  Starting February 8th I will be
*  gaining weight and you guys will be
*  losing weight. First one to pass me.
*  Is that going to do that? February 8th I'll be done with my
*  special. First one
*  to pass me I'll weigh in every day.
*  I'm going to get down to 190.
*  You'll pass me first.
*  You're starting at 180 basically?
*  I'll probably be at 175.
*  I'll be in shape.
*  What do you think you can get up to?
*  I've been up to
*  240 before.
*  No. Pull that picture up Jamie.
*  I remember that.
*  I remember those days. No I was in college.
*  No you got fat.
*  I've been like 220.
*  You have? Yeah I remember.
*  And he was eating candy.
*  He was eating candy all day. A lot of candy.
*  A lot of candy.
*  And then he just quit eating candy. And I was like that
*  motherfucker has got a will power.
*  That's one thing when we did the Sober October Fitness
*  Challenge. Honestly.
*  Legitimately. Ari was the only one I was worried about.
*  Why? Cause you're crazy.
*  I remember
*  doing jujitsu with you. I just didn't want to lose.
*  I know you don't like to lose. You get very serious.
*  We played pool. And even though I'm a
*  better pool player than Ari, I would give him the 7, 8, 9
*  and we would gamble.
*  So we'd play 9 ball. And I'd have to
*  run all the balls and sink the 9 to win.
*  But Ari could win if he sunk the 7,
*  the 8 or the 9. So it's a giant advantage.
*  So a huge difference.
*  And we would play fucking serious.
*  He would get very competitive. And then
*  I bought him a year of jujitsu once
*  for Christmas or Hanukkah or whatever the fuck you celebrate.
*  And uh. You know it's Hanukkah.
*  Whatever.
*  You don't even believe in God.
*  You don't even believe in God. You're an atheist.
*  It's nonsense. It's nonsense.
*  Anyway, um, so we were doing
*  jujitsu and he got fucking very serious.
*  Like we were rolling together.
*  Like he's really trying.
*  He's very competitive.
*  Ari's very competitive. But like he's got a
*  very strong mind. And I was like this motherfucker.
*  We're not doing anything where like
*  you have to get better at a physical skill.
*  Or you know you have to do
*  it's very simple.
*  All you have to do is have willpower
*  to stay at 80% of your max heart rate
*  for a long time.
*  And that's all willpower.
*  That's really all it is. Or if you're smart
*  enough to distract yourself like Ari figured out
*  how to watch movies. That was a big game changer
*  in the fucking thing. On the strap?
*  Yeah. Once you figured out how to watch movies
*  while you're on a treadmill or something like that. Yeah it was annoying
*  to have to constantly
*  be like working out.
*  That challenge part.
*  None of us expected that. To all of us to
*  go for it. It was so crazy. That part off each other.
*  It was so crazy. When you got the flu
*  and then you came back from the flu and ran 13 fucking
*  miles. That's why we didn't do a competition
*  this year. Holy shit.
*  We didn't do a competition because everybody's girlfriend
*  or wives was like no. No. No.
*  Yeah. Everybody was
*  mad. My whole family. Plus
*  I was just crazy man. I was
*  so into it.
*  I just like opened up that door.
*  I opened up that door that I didn't. I hadn't
*  opened up that door in fucking decades.
*  Who do you think will pass me first and wait between the two of you?
*  Me.
*  You think him too?
*  Yeah.
*  I
*  always just become obsessive compulsive
*  about it.
*  It's not
*  super fun but I'm cool with it
*  if I know I got nothing to do.
*  I got so much pizza. Do it.
*  How fat are you going to get? I mean hopefully
*  one of them stops. How great would it be if we didn't lose
*  any weight and just passed us?
*  You're 180. You have to gain
*  25 pounds just to get to Burt's target weight.
*  That's a lot of weight.
*  And Tom's target weight too.
*  I want you to look at this. I want you to look at this.
*  Tom might have done something a little early that we'll
*  talk about in a minute. But there's stacks
*  of steaks.
*  Wait what? Hold on.
*  25. 25. 25.
*  Joe. What?
*  What's going on? Joe.
*  When I was in the bathroom what the fuck
*  happened? I don't know. Jamie.
*  What happened? You motherfucker.
*  You cunt. I didn't do anything.
*  You saw the weigh in. You walked in. You walked in on it.
*  You saw the number. Oh.
*  Watch the video tomorrow.
*  This is bullshit.
*  He leaned on my shoulder.
*  Wait how did you know what was
*  my idea? Well you got lucky.
*  You know what we're
*  going to do for sub October this year I remember now
*  is we're going to say.
*  I saw Tom weighing in and I went oh that's
*  why I should weigh in. He's weighing in. You
*  motherfuckers.
*  I would never do something like that.
*  Really?
*  We have to tell him. He's going to watch the video.
*  Today I thought to myself I'd only
*  cheat on my wife if I was with you on
*  the road and you were cheating on Christina. I was like
*  then I'd be cool with it. I wouldn't look at it
*  and be like oh what?
*  We were both in a tour bus and you're like part of it. Let's both fuck
*  him. I was like alright Tom we're in.
*  By the way I thought you were doing
*  the Benny Hill song.
*  We were chasing two naked whores
*  around a bus.
*  Benny Hill. Who the fuck ever brings up
*  that show anymore. It's the last time you heard
*  Benny Hill. What was the song?
*  The song.
*  That's me and John
*  chasing around two naked chicks.
*  Like smacking people and girls would
*  smack him. It was always cute girls right?
*  He was like a pervert.
*  That was a straight B2.
*  God I forgot about that
*  fucking show.
*  You just brought that up. That's probably the first
*  time I thought about that show in more than a
*  decade. Long time?
*  Rape doesn't sound that bad with this music.
*  Pull up a video of the Benny Hill show
*  because I barely remember it.
*  He was like a chubby English guy right?
*  A lot of big expressions right?
*  Yeah. Hey Ari pour us a shot.
*  That's how much I trust you. Here it is.
*  The Benny Hill show. Here he is.
*  I'm not going to do it ever again. I know you won't.
*  I trust you. Look at him.
*  Benny Hill.
*  Yeah everything was like all fast and speeded up
*  and weird. Remember that show?
*  Trish people suck.
*  Alright we should wrap this bitch up.
*  Let's do a shot while we end the show. Do a shot
*  and the show goodbye America.
*  Not a vodka. Let's do a whiskey shot
*  while we end the show. Oh a real one.
*  Do we have glasses?
*  Do we have glasses?
*  Maybe you shouldn't pour it
*  if you're not on stage.
*  Do we have glasses for shots?
*  I got this
*  watered down.
*  I got this one.
*  Hey
*  Merry Christmas guys. Merry Christmas
*  gentlemen. Merry Christmas.
