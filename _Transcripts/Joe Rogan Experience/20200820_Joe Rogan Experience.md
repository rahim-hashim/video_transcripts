# Joe Rogan Experience #1528 - Nikki Glaser
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUCkrZKslr4)
*  Three two one hello, Nikki. Hello Joe Rogan. So I saw your tweet
*  This is how this all came about and you said you were gonna shave your head in solidarity for a friend who has cancer
*  Yeah, and then you're like actually there's no friend. Oh, no. Yeah, Nikki's going crazy
*  Yeah, I'm going off to the fucking deep end is what I was said
*  Yes, the problem I think we all are and I try I've been trying to like check in on everybody because all of us
*  Comedians have not had our medicine
*  You know point this is like we're junkies. We're laugh junkies
*  We really are you know, and I didn't realize how much I mean
*  I knew I missed it but I did one weekend in Houston like a month or so ago
*  Mm-hmm, and then right right away. I was like, oh my god, I got my fix like I'm and then
*  You know talking to all these people that are doing like Mark Norm's doing shows in a park
*  Yeah, you know Burt Christchurch is doing drive-ins. I'm doing them too. Are you? Yeah, I'm going out next weekend
*  What is it? Have you done them yet? No, so you have a verify any stand-up? Well, no, I don't stand up
*  I've been sneaking around just I mean I did a Salt Lake City
*  I went out there in July and did wise guys because they were doing it really responsibly. It was fun. It was good
*  It was fine
*  I mean it felt good to be on stage, but it felt weird like I need to be going out every night to feel really good
*  Yeah, you know it been so many months that I just I need to get some momentum
*  I need to work out a little bit
*  So it felt like I was getting my sea legs back
*  But I had good shows and and the room is just it's just you can they're not seating the room like
*  The way comedy is supposed to be seated which is everyone bunched together as close to the stage as possible
*  It's like it's the worst seated
*  The seating for comedy shows now is like a terrible club
*  You know you go to a club and they don't know how to see it
*  They just let people sit wherever they want. It's like a shitty open mic when you first started
*  That's the way it feels like now everyone has to be spread out
*  So it's never gonna feel as good as it felt before
*  With a sold-out crowd and no matter how good the laughs are them spread out in a big room
*  They didn't spread them out too much in Houston. I'm gonna be honest with you. Yeah, I don't know what they did in Houston
*  They said it was 75% capacity when we were there
*  Walk around with a clicker and start counting heads, but there was a lot of folks in there
*  No, I did one gig like that in st. Louis that I felt like
*  Okay, I don't I don't feel good about this
*  I did it because I wanted I was far enough from everyone to feel good about it
*  But I felt bad that maybe the audience got there and was like we were sold a different
*  Yeah idea of what this would be because we get in there and we're seated a little bit too close
*  But why is guys insult like they did it really like you if I felt good about being there
*  I didn't feel like anyone was gonna get sick. How many they see
*  It was definitely
*  Like a third capacity, I mean the guy is just struggling to stay open and I know it's so sad
*  But it didn't feel good all the loans are drying up all the relief is drying up
*  Are there gonna be comedy clubs to even go to after all of this a real good question. I'm nervous
*  it's a real good question, there's gonna be a lot less and
*  Then then what happens because a lot of bars are going under too
*  so it's not like you're gonna be able to replace them with bar shows because
*  Who knows how many bars are going I know who knows how many restaurants are going under New York City
*  I think it's something like four thousand businesses are done
*  So in Manhattan raising something I think that was the number and I read that a month and a half ago
*  It's got to be more by now four thousand
*  I mean, it's I haven't been there since before
*  COVID even though I have an apartment there and I just here it's it's just I don't want to be there
*  Yeah, I have a good buddy money lives there still he's been there the whole time and he says it's fucking war zone
*  It's terrifying. He said first of all, there's so much violence. There's so much crying you just can't he has a friend
*  That's a cop as well
*  And you know, he sent me the the sheet of all the things that happened that night and it's just nuts like so many shootings
*  And the shootings are off the charts. So like back to like the 1970s times like when Times Square was a
*  Junkie war zone they had it figured out for a couple years there. Yeah. Well, I don't know
*  What
*  We were talking about James Altucher wrote a piece about New York City's dead. It's not coming back. It's a sobering read
*  It's in the post today or yesterday
*  But it's a fucking sobering read because you read it and like it's not hyperbole everything you saying makes sense
*  Yeah, there's no reason for me to go back there. I've been considering going back just
*  Just because you don't want to abandon this city that you like so much and people that are staying there saying like
*  No, thank God. Oh
*  But I signed on for a how long I signed up for a lease a year lease that started March 1st. Oh yikes
*  The most expensive apartment I like truly paying three times the rent that I've ever paid cuz I was supposed to have a really good
*  Year cuz I was going on a theater tour that you know ended
*  I'm out
*  I'm not a lot of money every month that I'm trying to find a sublease we keep like lowering the rent
*  I mean, it's just I'm just out a year. That was the thing in Altucher's piece
*  It said that the New York City rental rates have gone down 50%
*  Which is crazy. I
*  Was looking for an apartment in January and February
*  Wish if I would have waited a month I could have saved so much
*  So yeah, I've got an empty place there my assistance just living there and it's all my stuff is just sitting there in storage
*  I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. Please your assistance there. Yeah, that's nice. Someone's there, but
*  It's it's it's um, it's must be weird for her too because it's an empty city
*  It's like weird moving around there. Yeah, it is. I don't know I don't know what you do all day
*  Yeah, because that's the thing about living in New York is that you have a shitty apartment small apartment
*  Because you're just out doing stuff all the time now. You can't do anything
*  So just in a shitty apartment, so you're just it. I mean my apartment is pretty nice. I never got to step foot in it
*  before
*  But apparently it's nice same building a tell lives in I guess I have had you guess you never asked him
*  Well, no, well, she just told me I think I saw a tell the other day so I think he's in there
*  There was a bunch of podcasts that I've done about
*  apocalyptic disasters and downfall of civilizations and like the Mayans and the Egyptians and you know
*  Asteroid impacts and we're right on course, but no but I was I was always looking at those going wow, it's fascinating
*  That's fascinating, but I never thought in my life that I would see something
*  Relatively minor in terms of like the amount of destruction
*  It's done, but in to human life in terms of you know
*  It's worse than a flu, but it's not like the pandemic of 1918 or any of these other horrific disasters
*  That have that have happened, but to see such an effect that it has on our civilization you go
*  Well, what if there was like an asteroid impact or what if there was a solar flow? How much worse would it be?
*  It could get a lot worse
*  Yeah, I think it's I'm so scared. I've always thought that we were gonna live to see the end
*  Did you really I do think that why people always go why?
*  Nikki every generation thinks they're gonna live to see the end and it never happens, you know
*  And I go well someone's gonna be around for it
*  There will be people here when that when the asteroid hits when the supervolcano erupts when
*  There's aliens land when the aliens land
*  Yeah, or when they tell us that they've been here a while when they finally reveal that they've been here
*  Is that what you think? I don't know. What do you think? I think so. I think they're here
*  Yeah, I think if there was an island that had chimps that were figuring out dynamite
*  We'd keep a close eye on them. Yeah, if there's a bunch of like advanced chant like right right now we have
*  Primates like lower primates. We have monkeys. We have chimps. We have gorillas and then we have humans
*  There's nothing in between that used to be there
*  right, but what if we found an island and it did have like Australia Pythagoras and
*  you know, they had you know, maybe they had spears or maybe they had some some primitive weapons and
*  you know, we were keeping an eye on them and someone had figured out dynamite and
*  They would be studying them so closely
*  But they wouldn't stop them in their tracks dynamite like let them watch. Let's see what happens. I think they wouldn't
*  They're just gonna watch us destroy ourselves before no
*  I think nuclear weapons is where they stepped in and if you pay attention to the timeline of
*  Ufology if you when you look at the UFO history of sightings and of like the really big sightings
*  Yeah, all of them came post the Manhattan Project
*  So once they I think once we started detonating nukes, they're like yo, these monkeys are lit
*  Like what are they doing these fucking crazy assholes?
*  They found a spot in Nevada and they're just detonating bombs all the time to see how they work
*  Why are they just like kind of being seen sometimes?
*  Slipping up we see them and then sometimes they're not like why
*  What's going on there with sightings? Why are they messing up? I don't think they are messing up
*  I don't want us to know that I don't think they're terribly concerned about us seeing them
*  But I don't think they visit that often because I don't look at like I was just reading about this
*  Scientific research it was for us Galante
*  I had this scientific research where they found this mouse that they thought had been extinct since 1968
*  It's this weird sort of kangaroo like tiny rodent. It has like kangaroo legs and it bounces around and
*  You know this this is something that people will go and they'll study but they didn't find it since 1968
*  So how many people are studying it not that many right right? So how many alien? There's a little fucker look at them
*  It's so cute
*  Adorable
*  Little an eater knows I know it's a very and they thought that this they thought this guy was gone. Yeah. Yeah now he's back
*  So it says imagine a creature the size of a rat related to an elephant with the legs of a kangaroo
*  That's been lost to science since 1968. That's the Somali Senji an adorable elephant shrew
*  recently discovered in boys say that word
*  jabuti jabuti jabuti researchers from
*  Duke
*  lemur Center Association
*  d'abuti nature and the Cal Academy
*  Found that the Somali Senji not only still exists
*  But appears to be doing well with population numbers appearing to be quite high
*  So but my point is like how many people were looking for that thing?
*  It's like a small handful of scientists where the aliens would come here how many oh, yeah, you're right
*  Maybe it's all handful. Yeah, not that many. Yeah, we're that little mouse. Yeah, I think so alien
*  I think we're probably more interesting than the mouse because obviously we we have the ability to
*  Pretty cute pretty cute door. I could have watched that thing. Yeah scamper about all day. We we're dangerous
*  We have the ability to destroy all life on the planet
*  Like if if Russia shot at us and we shot at them and then China jumped in said fuck it
*  It's over and everybody just started pressing the nuke buttons
*  This whole planet would be wiped out of life that we'd be we'd be relegated to bacteria
*  Right with it quickly. What does it matter to them if we destroy ourselves? They need us for something
*  This is the question. Why are we so different from all the other animals on the planet?
*  Why if you talk to evolutionary biologists?
*  There's a clear path between lower hominids and human beings
*  But it's not a path that you could detail every single step of the way and there's some giant holes
*  And one of the big holes is the size of the human brain the human brain doubled over a period of two million years
*  Which is apparently if you talk to biologists the biggest mystery in the entire fossil record
*  They have no idea why because not only is it a crazy thing that an organ?
*  Doubles in size over a period of two million years
*  But it's the very organ that came up with the idea of evolution in the first place
*  It's the organ that thinks is the organ that recognizes consciousness
*  it's the organ that recognizes creativity and allows people to invent things and and you know and
*  Innovation and all the different things that are responsible for all the crazy
*  The crazy technology that separates human beings from all the other animals all comes from this one thing the human mind and this human brain
*  Is the one organ that baffles scientists? They have no idea what happened
*  There's all these theories about well, maybe it was
*  psychedelic drugs like those Terrence McKenna's theory that it was the
*  Consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and then it's other people's theory that it was what we figured out fire
*  We started cooking our foods
*  We had more access to nutrients and then hunting made people more clever
*  And so the the more clever ones survived and the ones that had the larger brain size that mutation was
*  Favored and natural selection favored larger brains and then we started
*  Another theory is that we're manipulated another theory is that these
*  Aliens came here
*  Eons ago and they found these primitive primates and they started genetically manipulating them and they created human beings
*  Now what makes it interesting to me is?
*  That human beings are so
*  different
*  Everywhere so different
*  We're we're like dogs
*  In that all dogs can fuck each other and make baby dogs, right?
*  And all people can fuck each other and make baby people but we look so different
*  like Shaquille O'Neal can have sex with a
*  4-foot-10 Chinese lady and make a baby
*  Yeah
*  If you looked at animals a Great Dane can have sex with a Chihuahua if it's possible or a bulldog
*  And make this like if you looked at a wolf and you looked at a poodle you'd go
*  There's no way that's the same thing right, but it is the same thing. Yes the same thing
*  So why is this but why is it the same thing? It's the same thing because we manipulated them. Oh
*  Yeah, that's the only reason why there are
*  German shepherds we forced them to go the retreat. Yeah, we made them that way. We made them through manipulation
*  We slowly but surely turned them and we don't even know how so someone breeded us
*  Someone very possibly could have done something to human beings
*  Which changed us from these lower hominids and turned us into a bunch of different versions of what we call human beings
*  Right. I mean, that's my
*  Theory no, but it's but it's it's an odd thing
*  Like do you know that most hybrids like even bass like there's bass
*  We're like a largemouth bass will breed with a smallmouth bass and they'll make this hybrid but the hybrids aren't viable
*  They don't become a separate species. That's the thing about like donkeys like a donkey
*  Is it which ones the is it a mule has sex with a horse and that creates a donkey or is it a horse?
*  has sex with a
*  Donkey and that creates a mule. I think it's a mule has sex with a horse
*  And creates a donkey but donkeys are sterile. They're sterile. Most hybrids are sterile
*  Differencing a donkey. Okay
*  Donkeys are different species than a horse same family mules on the other hand are crossed between a horse and a donkey
*  Okay, that's it. So it's a mule is a cross between a horse and a donkey, but they're not they're sterile. They don't breed
*  so why even have a
*  Mule because we need it because they're better for riding
*  There they were more durable like in the Wild West
*  They like to cross those two and then people would like a lot of the Cowboys from the Wild West like
*  Even some of the Texas Rangers there they rolled up. They rode mules. Okay, so the donkey and the horse is
*  To ride and to be a better transport you
*  Which how does it
*  Where go back to where which one is it again the horse and okay horse and a donkey makes a mule
*  Yeah, so mules are more durable than horses. They require less water
*  They can last longer mules gets its athletic ability from a horse and its intelligence from a donkey
*  So mules were were what a lot of these Wild West guys would prefer actually
*  Okay
*  Mules have smoother muscles than horses think of a football players muscle build compared to that of a ballerinas
*  Both are very strong
*  But a mule has greater physical strength for its size and more endurance a mule gets its athletic ability from its horse and intelligence
*  From a donkey. Yeah. Well, let's just get rid of horses and donkeys mules sound like they're the best of both
*  Problem is you can only make a mule with a horse and a donkey. Oh
*  Because mules can't they can't read each other right, but we can which is weird. We can have sex with yes
*  We can have sex with each other like, you know, we can have sex with people that don't look anything like
*  Make something that can have sex. Yes, like if you looked at certain people you would assume that they're like if you looked at
*  Yao Ming, right? Right the giant tall dude. Yes, and you looked at a small man from Ecuador
*  You would assume there's no way that's the same species if you were from another planet and you had no idea what a human is
*  You'd be like, oh, this is a different thing. Yeah
*  Not a different thing, okay, it's just a different version of that same thing
*  Yes, but like a liger which is a cross between a tiger and a lion. They don't breed. They can't breed
*  They have useless sperm. It's what about bulldogs and like all those dogs that have really they can breed they can breathe
*  Yeah, they get well, they're just fucked. They just manipulated them and made their nose fucked up and they come out like asthma
*  I know they can't breathe. They're always they're trouble. I know fuckers. I feel so sad for them
*  A terrible thing but someone made them that way they they selected for that, you know, and then also, you know, obviously people
*  Their their bodies adapted to like people that are really white
*  Well, the reason why they're white is because people originated in Africa made their way to places where there's no Sun and so their body
*  Developed this sort of like a solar panel for vitamin D. That's why that's why people are so white
*  They're white because it's easier
*  This is one of the reasons why African Americans have a real issue with vitamin D
*  Because if you live in a place like say Seattle or New York City where there's not a lot of Sun
*  African Americans their their bodies are designed to protect themselves from the Sun, which is why they have so much melanin
*  But it makes it harder to absorb vitamin D, particularly when you're wearing all these clothes and it's cold out and it's cloudy
*  So it's incredibly important for them to supplement with vitamin D when they're in these climates where it's very cloudy
*  Now, how do you get your D?
*  You take it outside. Yeah outside too, but I take it I take vitamin D every day like a pill
*  Yeah, I take five thousand. Yeah, I take a gel cap. It's five thousand. I use I take it twice a day
*  It's very vitamin D is very important with Kobe
*  But isn't the absorption of D dependent on how much?
*  Iron you have like I just feel like it just goes through you unless you have all the other stuff
*  You do need the other stuff you well, you need fat like most of these muscle most of these
*  Vitamins rather they're fat soluble some of them are water soluble
*  But they does it digest better with food because that's really normally where you're getting them other than D
*  Which is where you get from the Sun. Yeah, but dr
*  Rhonda Patrick she explained it to me in a really interesting way
*  She said it really is a hormone vitamin D is we call it a vitamin and you can take it as a supplement
*  But it is a hormone and it's responsible for so many different things in the body and particularly for the immune system
*  And when you don't have vitamin D in your system, your immune system is very vulnerable
*  Yeah, so they were saying that there's all these studies that correlated with this
*  They're saying that out of people that were in the ICU for co vid more than 80% of them in multiple studies had
*  insufficient levels of vitamin D and only 4% had sufficient levels
*  Okay, which is really crazy. Then there we go. Yeah vitamin D zinc and vitamin C. They they're saying are the three most
*  Significant vitamins for dealing with are you are you are you scared of getting it giving it giving it giving it?
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm scared of giving it's like my wife's mom or right or a guest. I feel horrible. Yeah, so I'm tested
*  So much god damn it. I get tested a lot. Yeah. Yeah every week. I just you and I both did it. That was fun
*  Yeah, but I mean I've had this is my fourth test this week. Whoa. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, cuz I did the thing at the Comedy Store
*  So I got tested then during the day and then I got tested again
*  You know, I just I've been tested
*  I don't know how many times I've been tested since the whole thing started but I'm fortunate that I could have you know
*  the concierge MD service they're right
*  it's a
*  Would you do at the Comedy Store though? The night I saw people hanging out though. It's for the documentary for Showtime
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was interesting. Yeah, really fun. Was it fun to hang out again? It was fun
*  That was the most fun. I saw pictures. Yeah, it's like
*  Whitney and Annie Letterman and Bill Burr and Jay Leno was there and Paul Rodriguez and we were all just laughing
*  He misses doing I heard him say fuck
*  Trying out jokes on us too. Yeah, he was happy to be out. We're all happy to be out
*  Yeah, it looked I thought it was a TBT the pictures from that. I was like all the old day what that's two nights ago
*  Yeah, yeah two nights ago, you know, I miss it. Yeah, they're gonna survive, right?
*  Who fucking knows? I don't know how the laugh factor is gonna survive
*  Right laugh factor is struggling already and the improv was struggling already
*  I mean these people they're getting they're getting loans these businesses and stuff
*  But I mean how many fucking businesses need loans?
*  I think them they should have just opened it up and let people come if they wanted to come
*  Let people work if they wanted to work wear a mask, you know check everybody check their temperature when they come in the door
*  When you go to Texas if you go to a restaurant, they just check your temperature
*  They check your temperature you wear a mask when you come in they distance all the tables out and they stay open
*  Yeah, and they're not making a lot of money. They're not making as much money as they used to they don't have as nearly as many tables
*  Open, but they stay open
*  You got to give businesses the option to work give people the option to work
*  Give people the option to go out if they want to go out this idea that they're just gonna tell us what's best for us
*  But they're not telling us what's best for us because they're not telling us all the shit that we're just talking about with vitamins
*  Right, and there's no talk of that. There is no one knows anything. I'm getting all of this from you right now
*  There's nowhere it's all you can just one place go and get everything you need to know people get pissed at me for repeating
*  These things but listen, I'm repeating these things because they don't know people don't hear it
*  You're not gonna hear it anywhere else. If you've heard it from me 30 times
*  I'm sorry. It just means you like the podcast you listen
*  Yeah, but the reality is there's not a lot of other sources where you're getting this information
*  So I try to put it out as much as possible
*  And I try to direct people to folks like Rhonda Patrick who will tell you exactly what the studies are and and she sent me
*  something recently there's another
*  Correlation study between vitamin D and kovat and how vitamin D the actual mechanisms and how vitamin D protects you and it protects your immune system
*  From kovat. Yeah
*  Vitamin D zinc see but you should take all those things you should drink a fuckload of water
*  How many vitamins do you take? Why are you taking just like fistfuls every morning? What's your regimen?
*  I take a bunch of different things. I take there's a supplement called athletic greens. I take that
*  It's really good first of that's really easy because you just pour it into a bottle of water and I shake it up
*  And I just drink it. Yeah, you know and it tastes good
*  So that's that's really easy for me and that covers basically everything
*  But I always supplement with D and I always supplement with large amounts of C
*  Because those are two and zinc because those are C
*  Zinc and D are the ones that are directly connected to the immune system for kovat
*  But C is like if you have a colds like C is one of the best for keeping everything
*  That's why things like emergency
*  Yes things exists like C is just a great one for your overall immune system and taking care of yourself when you're sick
*  so and but I just think like having levels of all those things like
*  Fish oil as a giant one. Yeah inflammation fighting CBD. I take that every day. I take CBD every day
*  Yeah, I have CBD drinks these CBD kill cliffs. Do you like CBD? I need no
*  I mean, I like smoking weed and I feel like I get enough from that. I'm sure you do get a lot
*  I mean, I just quit smoking what's to win to go why because I just am trying to figure out my mental health and get a
*  Figure out what the hell is wrong
*  I mean, that's why I mean that's why I'm sitting here right now is because I was having a very tough time and I tweeted something
*  Kind of crazy that I wanted to shave my head because I really do like I just feel like something something needs to change
*  I need to do something wild. I don't know why I'm compelled. My hair has been falling out
*  I think just from stress and I'm just like I'm tired of pulling chunks of hair out. It's just it's distressing really that you're losing that much
*  I mean, I well I've just started only like washing my hair once a week
*  So when I do wash it, it's like so much comes out because it's been a week of just no strands coming out
*  And you lose a hundred hairs a day
*  So once a week I wash my hair and it just feels like I'm just you know
*  That I was in a fight or something someone like I mean it's and I just put it I put it on the wall and I just
*  It stresses me out so much
*  And so I was like I'm just gonna shave it and I'm not going to but I did
*  Just kind of want to put out a tweet that just sometimes when I'm feeling depressed
*  I just need to let people know or just kind of synthesize my feelings through that
*  way and and I don't do it to like make anyone concerned about me, but
*  Really meant a lot to me that you reached out to me and I was
*  Completely taken aback by it that you you sensed my dilemma. Well, I know you and so
*  There was something when you were saying also, there's no friend
*  So nice and then it turned into this yeah, I mean I when I when I tweeted it
*  I was just like don't put this out there. Hey when people tweet like cries for help and then what was a funny cry for help
*  At least thank you. I try to at least be funny with them, but um, it just really irritates me
*  It's like just just reach out to your friends if you need help
*  Don't put out a tweet that makes everyone worried about you
*  So a couple people reached out to me like hey, are you okay?
*  But it was yours that um, it really touched me because we don't like text regularly
*  But that was like it was just such a real
*  like
*  Loving text. I know that really meant a lot to me and I was going through a really
*  Fucking bad time last week this time last week was not in a good place. Thankfully I came out of it
*  But I keep getting hit by depression like in a major way
*  I've been trying to reach out to a lot of friends
*  Lately over the last two months like just send. What's up, man? You good really nice. Just a nice little just hey
*  How are you? Yeah, and a lot of hugs. There's so many people that haven't been hugging no one's touching
*  It's weird, you know, so and no one can see each other smile when they hang out. They're wearing masks
*  I mean we all feel so disconnected
*  I'm living with my parents in st. Louis. I my whole social life was comedy
*  I don't I didn't really have friends outside of it. The only thing that's saving me is this yeah
*  Yeah, me too like doing podcasts and zooming with people and doing different
*  Just facetiming thank God for it, but it's I'm
*  Where the fuck would we do with no cell phones and no facetime? What the where the fuck would we be with no Skype?
*  Where would we be? I don't know like that is giant for me facetiming just being able to like just see people
*  See their smile
*  We need it
*  and
*  yeah, and it's weird to just hang out with my nieces and nephews and they're got like
*  Three and one and that we have to wear a mask around them and you can't they can't even see your smile
*  You can't touch them. That's really bad really weird for kids
*  They must be like why is my aunt not touching me anymore?
*  Mike I can't hug Mike when if I even get close to my grandparents I hear no no no no no
*  It's like this is gonna be scarring
*  But the weird thing about it is if everybody's just tested why can't you just yeah hang out like what?
*  What are we worried about like invisible ghosts that come in invade people's bodies and you're not if you don't have it
*  You don't have it. Yeah, you know
*  But you worry that between the time you got tested in the time you're seeing that person you might have gone to the gas
*  Station and touched a nozzle or you're not getting it that way they don't think you know that way from surfaces
*  I know we've wasted so many Clorox wipes. Yeah, they've kind of abandoned that have you noticed like they don't even
*  Talk about hand sanitizer and sanitizer. No no one cares about that anymore. It's just a mask. Yeah, it's just a respiratory issue
*  Yeah, it's just coming out of your mouth and into someone else's mouth
*  That's so annoyed if I flew here from st
*  Louis the other day and just sitting at my gate and it's mandatory to wear a mask on the plane now
*  People before before they get on that plane. They're just sitting there without their mask on at the gate
*  Just trying to stir up shit just trying to get away
*  Because they everyone around you is wearing a mask. How could you not wear one you know? That's what they're doing
*  Yeah, they just they they want to prove that they're not falling for it
*  And they're better than you and they're it's so deliberate and it makes me sick
*  And it's it's hard because I want to shoot them a dirty look
*  But they can't really see how much I hate them on my face covered by a mask
*  So I really try to squint my eyes just like you motherfucker
*  I was so furious the other day just people with the loose mask down by their nose
*  I had a driver the other day that had his nose exposed and I just am like hey
*  Can you you pull it up over your nose?
*  It's the only way it works like do I really have to you haven't seen that meme yet with the guy with his dick at like
*  How has that not gotten to you that that's how you wear a mask? Yeah people just it's it's I don't know I
*  Everyone I'm staying in Marina Del Rey everyone walking outside is wearing a mask
*  Which I think is a little much just like walking down the sidewalk. We don't need it when it's sunny out
*  Yeah, this the disease the virus dies instantly and when it's exposed to sunlight, okay?
*  Why why don't we know that Joe?
*  I don't know but Brett Weinstein who's a biologist sent me this paper where they showed that it dies
*  instantly in when it's almost instantly what's in contact with
*  Fake sunlight like ultraviolet light and also also actual sunlight so when you're in sunlight
*  Like you're if you're outside like you're that's why the closing the beach is so fucking stupid like it's sunny like you're not at risk
*  So I'm like in someone's face. You're not gonna get it and did they see a spike after the protests
*  Yeah, after all that for sure that was there was a nice person it has to be but that was a light outside
*  What did they stop as soon as it turns dark out?
*  No, that's true of course not all right
*  When people are saying that to me, I'm like what the fuck are you talking about is everybody Cinderella? Oh my god
*  I'm gonna be building up a song can we we can just protest and gather outside
*  So it's like aren't but but even then people are screaming right? Yeah
*  That's just like spewing droplets everywhere
*  Yeah, don't have a mask on and you're screaming and other people are screaming and then there's people yelling at each other
*  So they're in each other's faces
*  There's like very little chance you're not gonna get some spread if you've got what you know
*  I forget was it Ben Shapiro said it was like having a music festival in every city for three weeks in a row
*  I mean it really was it's like you constantly had protests
*  Yeah, so if you have that many people it looked it's not a coincidence that it spiked right afterwards
*  But nobody wants to say it because nobody wants to be insensitive. Yeah, no one talked about it
*  I remember the protests going on and what we were all like
*  We'll see in three weeks and then I don't remember hearing about the spike that happened for sure spike
*  That's when everything got shut down in LA. Mmm, everything got shut down. The hospitals got filled again. There's the cases
*  Rose look, you know, it has to be either. It's contagious or it's not
*  Okay, if it's contagious and you get a bunch of people together, they're gonna give it to each other, right?
*  There's no way around it. It's not saying that it's not a good cause and that it wasn't important to protest
*  Yeah, all those things are true, but understand that that's what happened
*  Yeah, I don't think you should stop people from protesting, but I also don't think you should stop people from working
*  I don't think you should stop people from going to the gym
*  You should give people the opportunity to do whatever they want to do
*  That's what America's supposed to be about right? The problem is the hospitals the ICU beds and all that stuff
*  Respirators, but they don't even use respirators anymore
*  One of the things they're finding with respirators is the vast majority the people that put on respirators died
*  Yeah, because when you're at that point not necessarily according to Michael Yo's doctor
*  He told him if I put you on a respirator, you're gonna die because your body's gonna stop working
*  Because because you need to anymore for you, right? Yeah, and then so stop fighting get off the respirator
*  It's hard for your body to breathe
*  Yeah, so they thought you needed respirators
*  Right now the big thing right then now they've adjusted that position
*  They don't they don't think it's a good idea to put people on respirators anymore unless they're really bad like they're about to die
*  Right. Yeah, it's that's life support. Yes, exactly
*  So now they use more like CPAP machines, which are just they give you
*  Yes, yeah, so instead of breathing for you it just introduces more oxygen into your system
*  Okay, so that many, you know, there's so many things that we thought but the beginning that our thing
*  It's like I don't care if you're sitting at my gate and you don't believe in mass
*  And you think we're all so crazy and we're all just sheep wearing masks. Just everyone around you is doing it
*  Just do it if it just be polite
*  Even if you don't believe because like I was saying like walking today outside and seeing people with masks on I was kind of like
*  I think this is kind of stupid but I felt like out of respect for them
*  I'm gonna wear a mask, even though I don't think I really need to be wearing it. I'm gonna do it
*  Yeah, so that's all I asked people to do
*  it's just if someone around you if I go over to someone's house and they
*  They want me to take my shoes off, but I don't really believe in doing that
*  I'm still gonna do it because they do it. Yeah, just to be nice. Yes
*  Sure, I mean and I just think the peer pressure have you been I've
*  Early when this was happening
*  I was like getting invited to like social distance
*  barbecues and things like that when they were like just trying it out and going over to these things and
*  Under the understanding that we're all gonna stay six feet apart and wear masks
*  And then you get there and people are hugging and people are close and you just kind of feel peer pressured into doing it
*  Well people go back to the normal patterns normal patterns is especially when people are drinking
*  Yeah, this is the drinking. Yeah, like you know, it's fucked up
*  It's like the Trump rally when he had that big rally when he had in the stadium
*  No one was wearing a mask and then Herman Cain died
*  I know and they were like well it could have been many of place he was or
*  One place with 10,000 people on one place
*  Yeah, yeah
*  But I mean even I go into these parties being like I'm gonna keep my distance
*  I'm only going if it's done right and then I get there and you feel so stupid being the only one who has a
*  Mask on or and you feel it's hard to stand up for yourself. Sometimes I'm like fine spit in my mouth
*  I guess we used to do that. Well, if there was these tests where you could do it
*  Instantaneously and then you know, you could just have my comedy club
*  Yes, you just have people take a test as they're walking through the door aren't those coming out soon
*  The White House has them really? Yeah
*  Yeah, my friend went to the White House and they test them you have it in within a couple of minutes
*  All right. Well, that'll solve a lot of issues
*  That would be everything if you just had like a giant, you know
*  Align where everybody spread out by six feet you test them on the line
*  You know you write your name down or or you have to register
*  Maybe the show is at eight you have to show up at seven and get tested and then you be there at eight
*  Look at being convenient, but it's way better than having no show and then you could go there
*  No one could have a mask you have a regular club and have the place packed. It's possible
*  I can't believe I took that for granted so much
*  Well, I just thought we just always thought it would be you'd be able to do that
*  You can think I thought anything else could happen in my career
*  I'll always have standard to fall back on well everybody thought that
*  You know everybody like how many people didn't have a podcast
*  If I didn't have a podcast I would be first of all, I'd be bouncing off the walls
*  I wouldn't know what the fuck to do and then I would be at a point where I was thinking like hey
*  I gotta make a living. Yeah, like what do I need to do to make a living?
*  Maybe I need to get a regular job
*  Like how many comics are getting jobs a lot of them and you can't get a job in show business because they're not filling anything
*  So just so what would you do?
*  I would have to I'd go to know I can't even teach martial arts because gyms are closed right? It's like what would I teach?
*  Mmm, and if you teach you got to do it over zoom now to be a good nobody wants to oh my god
*  If you want to get paid to teach over zoom good luck. Nobody wants to pay for that. Yeah. Well, I mean I'm
*  Thank you. Yeah. Thank God for podcasting. Thank God, you know, I'm trying to write a goddamn book
*  No, why haven't you written a book? Well, I got a deal to write a book and the editors were so annoying
*  I gave them their money back
*  Yeah, just like hey, do you have these pages yet? Hey, we like they based it on some stuff that I wrote on my blog
*  that was you know, sometimes funny just but weird just thoughts that I had yeah and
*  But then once I started turning in stuff
*  they're like we want to transcribe your stand-up because Jerry Seinfeld did that and and and and
*  Fucking who else did it?
*  George Carlin and I'm like look George Carlin did it because he needed money
*  All right, he was broke taxes and I don't know why Seinfeld did it
*  They probably just paid him and he said okay, but I'm like, I'm not doing that
*  Like if I'm writing if I want to write a book, you're gonna write it's supposed to be consumed in book form
*  Stand-up is supposed to be consumed on stage. That's that's the different things
*  it really helped me though reading those stand-up kind of transcribed stand-up books when I first started stand-up to like
*  Read jokes and like learn the craft of writing a joke and the consolidation of words
*  Like I turned to those books where like people would just take stand-up and and write it down
*  But yeah beyond that I from a comedian
*  I think they it's it's well an easy way to repeat like when I first started doing stand-up
*  One of the things that I used to do is I would do other people's bits for my friends
*  Like I do a Kinnison bit or a Richard Pryor bit for one of my friends and like that sort of got me into like the
*  Rhythm of stand-up and then I read that Hunter S Thompson when he was learning how to write he would
*  Literally write down the great Gatsby line for line
*  So he would sit there and and retype the great Gatsby just so he can get an idea of the rhythm of the
*  Yeah, yeah, I've been doing that
*  recently with stand-up like I've stepped away from watching stand-up
*  but I've been watching it again just because I need to remember how to do it and why I love it and
*  And and so much I think of who I became as a stand-up
*  Started out just like trying to copy sure. Oh, yeah, just trying to figure out
*  How do you do this and watching it so much and ending up sounding like a mixture of all the people that I love so much
*  Yeah, that's always weird, right the beginning. You're always like a copy of the people you admire
*  Yeah, I mean I still look at some of the things I do and I'm like, oh that you picked that up from Silverman
*  Yeah, yeah, you picked that up from
*  Gaff again. Yeah Hedberg. I mean there you're just a mixture of everyone that you love and then eventually you
*  Gain some autonomy and you figure out stuff that works for you and who is truly you but even my own
*  Personality before I did stand-up is all based upon
*  me
*  Ripping off the popular girls the way they talked and the way they acted
*  There was one girl that had like kind of a lazy eye in my in my high school who like was really hot and
*  Like all the guys liked and I started like kind of like
*  Do it I would just try to like have like a slightly like
*  It would just happen because I was like trying to get any way to for people to like me
*  There's another girl talked like a baby and I would just like start talking like this and like no people liked her cuz she was
*  Hot not because her voice was like a baby
*  So I just I really am if if I listen to someone too much
*  I start I start sounding like them and copying them. It's a real problem
*  That's why sometimes I can't watch some of the stand-ups
*  I love because I just start sounding like them when I can't help it
*  I just did a girl out of kind of a lazy eye and she was really hot
*  Yeah, I had like a fetish for lazy eyes
*  Like a one slightly lazy eye
*  And I just thought it was really hot afterward cuz she was a freak so like I just associated lazy
*  I was like, what was she do really horny? Oh, yeah, she's just really sexual like all the time
*  Yeah wanted to get stuffed yeah, she was really horny that's so fun
*  Yeah, and I was 21 and she was down. She was older than me too. So it was interesting
*  How much older a couple years when she was 25 and I was 21. Well when you were young, what was the oldest you went?
*  Did you ever I think I dated girl was 35 when I was like 23
*  Okay, I'm in a couple days. Yeah, but it's usually like you just getting used by some chick who wants get gorilla fucked
*  It's usually some woman who's tired of like dating guys who work in an office or she goes and find some see I have
*  Coming after me and I feel like they're using me
*  So that they can just like somehow have a story about like fucking an older woman and I don't want to be that like
*  That's interesting. I don't want to why wouldn't you just think they're attracted to you because you're confident and intelligent
*  Um, because I think it's some weird fetish they have where they like they are they had a speech therapist that they
*  Like got boners for and I remind them of her. I like there's something I think that you're sexy
*  Why wouldn't you just I don't know because I just don't look at myself that way
*  I cannot there are certain times where I do feel really sexy and I and I can I can feel that way
*  But generally when someone's into me I go what's going on here?
*  What do you want?
*  Because it can't be that you want to have sex with me even though I know I'm an attractive girl and like I work on being
*  Attractive it's not like I'm I don't think I'm a dog. You're suspicious
*  Yeah, I'm suspicious and you want to know why because sometimes I'm fucking right and especially since I've gotten a little bit more famous
*  that happens and I and because it as I've gotten a little slightly more famous I have my self-esteem has
*  risen a bit in terms of just I like myself and I'm like
*  Oh, maybe this guy does like me for me and then it happens that they just want an autograph from you or they want
*  Honestly someone wrote me that today and a guy that has been interested in me and asking me out a ton
*  And he just wrote me today like hey, I heard you're gonna be on Rogan
*  If there's any chance you could get an autograph from him, that would be so cool
*  Thank you, so and I just wrote back no like just no with nothing else
*  No, and you don't even bother putting a period I didn't say no, I'm sorry. No, I don't feel comfortable doing that. No, no, no, but
*  That's happened before so you worry that they look at you as being someone who's got a high profile
*  And maybe if they connect themselves to you
*  It can help their life in some way to fuck other girls in their social circle because they said they fucked a girl that was on
*  Celebrity game night playing badminton with Bob Saget
*  I mean, that's how I feel is that and I'm not wrong like this does happen
*  There was another instance where a guy got a picked a guy thought liked me and I do think he likes me
*  But he got a picture with me and I guess we both weren't wearing masks in the picture
*  I guess we were too close to each other and he couldn't post the picture because
*  He felt like it would be bad a bad look for me. We're not wearing masks, but we were like for me
*  I was like we're far enough apart, but do what you want and
*  And he's and I go okay. He's like, oh, so I'm not gonna post it. I was like, okay, that's totally fine
*  And then he's like, but I would really like to see you again. Like I really liked hanging out with you
*  I'd love to take you out sometime and I was like, hey
*  I just don't think I'm in a point in my life where I want to be dating right now and he goes
*  Well, can we just meet up to get a picture? Oh
*  So it happens, you know, it happens a lot it happens
*  Meet up just to get a picture. So now let everybody know I know you yeah
*  Or and then I then this what I see is him getting that picture and then going back to like show the girls that he
*  Really wants to bang their or his age at some party and he's like
*  I got a picture with Nicky Glazer and they're like, we don't know who she is. What does she like?
*  Yeah, she's like 36 and then they all make fun of me and that's like that's
*  Wasn't even funny and I'm like that's I just see them all making fun of me and like how pathetic that I am that I've
*  Like fucked a younger kid
*  I shouldn't say the word kid. I like I think he's like 25, which is not that's not that bad
*  Guy that's standard he's going to love that I'm talking about him. I really want to change the subject
*  Isn't that so that's the worst part to talk about these people than they then they're so excited
*  I'm gonna get a text as soon as I'm out of here. Hey, I didn't know there was some animosity between us
*  I swear I really did want to spend time with you
*  I think you're really great to take a picture with you just cuz I think you're awesome
*  I just wanted to document the fact that I know you there was this guy on a plane a couple weeks ago
*  and
*  I met him at my gate and usually when I fly I just like put on my headphones and like
*  Sleep mask and I just try to stay I don't want anyone talking about mask and sleep mask. Oh my god
*  Face shield I've been wearing the shield
*  Shield don't don't feel yeah, I want to make a statement that like I
*  Hate all of you not wearing a mask and now I have to doubly protect myself and look what you've made me do
*  I want to send that message. I love wearing the shield at first. I felt stupid now
*  I feel cool
*  And if anyone's gonna judge me they can't recognize me they can't even see me in there. So it's great
*  so usually I'm but when I fly even pre-covid I would just always kind of I
*  Just didn't want anyone talking to me. I've been
*  Caught in conversations on planes with people and it just brutal. It's brutal and I learned the hard way
*  But like years and years ago some people just don't stop and you can never close your eyes
*  You can never relax
*  Your eyes and they still talk
*  Yeah
*  or they you put your sleep mask down there talking you have to lift it back up and you just have to eventually say I
*  just don't want to talk but this one guy sat next to me at my gate and
*  I
*  Feel bad because he heard me talk about him on Whitney's podcast and he felt really bad. Well this happened but whatever
*  But it just this this I want to just tell you that it happened. I was sitting at my gate
*  I was a hot guy sat down next to me and I took off my head
*  I made like my head accessible
*  Like I kept my mask on but I took out my headphones to be like if you want to talk to me
*  Definitely good and I did I said there was like some I don't know
*  There was a gate announcement that was kind of funny and I just like muttered something to myself like making fun of the woman
*  Talking trying to get this guy to like laugh or just spark up a conversation and he was just like hey
*  I'm a big fan. I was like what really I was like, oh my gosh. Thanks. I was like, what do you know me from?
*  Like
*  What do you he's like, I love your show and I'm like what show and he's like your podcast
*  I was like, oh this guy knows me cuz my podcast it's like I do it every day. It's really like
*  It's like reading my diary. I don't even like my friends to listen to it. It's just too much
*  So I was like, oh this guy like accepts me for me and he likes it. He's like tall hot
*  I can't see half of his face, but I think he's cute. It looks good. What you see looks good
*  Yeah, and I never ever meet guys like out in public. I've never been someone that like has chatted up a guy
*  At my gate or like on the plane it just never happens to me and so I'm like, yes
*  start chatting up and it's like going really well and
*  And I'm flying southwest. So there's no like boarding order and or no there is
*  I'm like the first to board but there's no there's no seat assignment. So he says to me
*  Save me a seat next to you. Let's let's continue this conversation on the plane. So I'm getting on the plane
*  I'm like, listen, I want to sleep I need to sleep and I was gonna but I got I gotta find a husband and this
*  Might be the one like I got it. I gotta put myself out there. I've been so closed off for so many years
*  So I get on that plane and we were chatting. We're having like a really good time
*  he's like funny and nice and interesting similar interests and
*  You know, he he lives on the West Coast, but I'm like I can move anywhere like I'm down. Let's do this and
*  And it's it's it's flirty but it's not like there's nothing over the top
*  But I was just like I kept thinking I didn't see a ring on his finger. There's no mention of a girlfriend and
*  Then finally I'm like we need to switch this to like a flirty kind of we need to talk about dating or something to get
*  us in that kind of
*  Vane of conversation and I said something like so have you been dating during kovat and this is two and a half hours
*  Into the flight and he's like, oh well
*  I have a I have a girlfriend who I live with and I was just
*  almost started crying because
*  Not because I was like, oh I'm this guy
*  I thought I was gonna be with him but because I just could have been sleeping that entire time and I wasted this
*  And I don't want to anyone but there's no other way to know I you could have mentioned her
*  Why if he just thought that you thought that he was a fan and he wanted to talk to you
*  Want to talk to a fan?
*  Hi, maybe just is an interesting person you know, I know that you were tired no, it wasn't his fault
*  It wasn't his fault. It was my fault to get my hopes up
*  But that's too far into a conversation to not trust you got it. You're talking to a girl who you know is single
*  Do you sound like a guy?
*  Age appropriate do you sound like I do? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm talking to her for fucking two hours
*  That's and then finally she says I have a boyfriend. I live with what the fuck I bought you three drinks already
*  Yeah, yeah, I'm that guy don't waste my time. Don't waste my money if you have a girlfriend
*  It's just it's I was really ticked off. But he's a fan though. You are a public person
*  You are a professional comment was going on but Nikki you have fans you sell out all over the country
*  I know I you're a real comedian. It had been many months since I had been on stage
*  I've been living with my parents for four months. I forgot who I was
*  And I was so I was so excited I was so sad and I continued the conversation cuz then I go you know what?
*  Nikki, what can't you just get to know someone and
*  Relationships fail. He's as a girlfriend. It's not like he's married like I'm sorry kids are gonna grow up
*  They're gonna get out of the house
*  Whatever I can wait years. Yeah, it's no big deal. I'll plant that seed girlfriend. I don't dig a hole
*  I'm not gonna see would leave flirt with a guy or like try to break up a relationship
*  I mean, I would never do that. But if a guy is a girlfriend, I'll still like have a flirty conversation because
*  Mostest I'm last most things don't most well, everything doesn't last. Well, yeah, that's true
*  Everything your life, but if a guy's married then I'm like, okay
*  well, I saw no hope a story about a couple that
*  Dated when they were in high school and then they got married they married other people broke up the whole deal
*  Went through lives and then got married again when they were in their late 70s. That is sweet. I like that
*  Yeah, it is kind of adorable. They decide like what we've been fucking around all this time. Yeah, what have we been doing?
*  I know I feel like you know, I've been
*  I've been circling the same guy for a really long time. How long I've only had a shark. Yeah, I like a cat
*  God like a like that is extinct mouse
*  I
*  Haven't seen me since the 60s
*  It's not
*  Yeah, it's that I've only really had one
*  actual relationship and we have just we've gotten we've got back together back and forth for like
*  Five or six years broke up and got back together broke up and got back together and then we haven't been together for over
*  Like three years now, but we slept together for a while even after that
*  but we haven't slept together for like a year and some change and
*  And he and oddly enough. He just moved back to st. Louis
*  Oh, we both met in New York City, but he just and he's living with his parents, too
*  Oh, it's as we're both looking to what we're gonna do next
*  Yeah, you think it is perfect, but he won't have sex with me what I know because I think he like is gay cares about me
*  And like doesn't want to right upset me because I tend to have sex with someone and then I get
*  My hopes up a little bit. I mean I got my hopes about a plane with the conversation with the guy
*  I was like planning our future together. What were you thinking?
*  What was like the ultimate goal like you're seeing the babies you're seeing the whole thing
*  No
*  It's just like he was talking about his family and I was like picturing meeting them and he mentioned like moving to San Diego
*  And I was like kind of annoyed cuz I'm like we haven't even talked about San Diego yet
*  I'm not even joking you
*  You mentioned some things that I'm like, well, you don't even know that I want to go there
*  But I would but he that's weird that he would just say that so yeah, I mean I
*  Really do I as soon as I start talking to a guy I start picturing our future
*  I picture like walking down the aisle to him
*  Yeah, get ahead of myself. Well, that's better than the opposite
*  Okay, which is like never thinking you're ever gonna be in a relationship and every guy you talk to never
*  Imagining that it's ever gonna go anywhere. Yeah. Yeah. No, at least I have some hope. Yeah, you're hopeful. I do have hope
*  Yeah, you're hopeful. So this guy this guy cares about you. So he won't hook up with you because he doesn't want to get your hopes up
*  Yeah, it's really nice. That's a nice guy every time we hung it hang out together
*  I'm always like
*  Can we please just have sex like I haven't had sex in 17 months now
*  It's so long Joe won't just hook you up
*  No, well, we I know it's terrible
*  I'm and and I'm really I mean I could get laid
*  It's not a pro like there are guys that would gladly fuck me, but I just don't I don't feel comfortable having random sex
*  I'm not good at it
*  I need to really like someone and he just knows how to get it done and we've done it so many times
*  So easy, yeah, but I don't but he's right. I probably would think oh my god, we're gonna be something
*  We're gonna get back together and then my heart would get broken again. So it might not be worth it
*  But what does he do? He's a he works in radio. He's a he's on he was a
*  Producer behind-the-scenes producer we met on a show that I had on MTV and then we created a show together on Comedy Central
*  and then and then that show got canceled and then we got canceled and then he
*  Now he's on the radio in st. Louis, he's like a broadcaster now and
*  Yeah, so he's a good guy. He has a good guy thinking about it that way
*  Yeah, cuz most guys if a girl's like, well, can we please have sex like
*  That's it. Just sex. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, and I've said that before so many times like that's all I that's all I want
*  I don't want anything more than that. So not true though
*  I you get to learn men have to learn that that's not really true
*  I mean, I've only had a couple times ever in my life
*  But I was younger and stupid where a girl said I just want sex
*  but then after you give it to them they
*  Generally, that's not really the case
*  No
*  because I think women develop like intimacy bonds with men in a different way like like we were talking earlier about
*  Not that I think I know right or it's general generalizing
*  But we're talking about using like men do not care if you use them
*  It means zero like if a woman is like, I just want to use you for sex guys like, okay
*  Yeah, it doesn't it's not there's no negative connotation
*  like if if you are walking by a girl and her friends and she used you for sex and she tells her friends
*  Yeah, I fucked that guy just for the sex and the guy's there like
*  He's gonna feel bad. Yeah, if a girl walks by and a guy's hanging out with his friends. It's like yeah
*  I just use her for sex. She's gonna be like, oh
*  She's gonna feel terrible the guy wouldn't feel bad at all unless he's really weird
*  Obviously, we're generalizing again. Sure, but most men are not gonna have an issue with that
*  I don't know
*  I just got kind of horned up when you said when you when I pictured passing a guy and someone said I just used
*  Her for sex that kind of was exciting to me because he doesn't want anything
*  I'm scared of intimacy in a big way
*  So I do like the idea of just being used and like oh someone just doesn't want to get to know me
*  Problem is if you get rocked right and it's fun and you enjoy it and you actually have a good time
*  Well, you got to assume too if you're having sex with somebody you don't hate them. Yeah, you like them
*  I know that's the problem. You have to like someone have sex with them
*  And then you have sex with them
*  You just then now you like them and you had sex and then here's the other problem if you like them more than they like
*  You then you get upset like a lot of times people when they get rejected by someone they feel pain
*  They feel pain of either be rejected or neglected and then they associate that pain with something negative that the person has done even if they
*  Haven't really done anything negative and then they get angry at that person. Yep, and you're like I didn't do anything
*  That's what you just used me for sex and like ah
*  Yep, no we had sex
*  It's not even like I would feel like I was getting used but I would just be so disappointed like why don't you want more with
*  Me why wouldn't you want to marry? Why don't you want to spend time with me all the time?
*  Why don't you want to be my man and um, and that's wrong
*  But what he does do that makes me feel great is like I he always says I want to make it clear
*  I want to fuck you so bad
*  You look like he'll tell me all the things that I need to hear that essentially just kind of get you juiced up
*  Yeah, like it makes me feel as good as if I got
*  Dicked down. Okay, so he says all things I want to but the problem is like you look so good
*  This is what I do to you. This is what I want to do
*  Smash it. Yes, and then I leave feeling like oh, okay, like still got it. That's good. So it is good
*  So I'm a good guy. He is a good guy and
*  And I like that asshole on the fucking plane
*  No
*  That guy was so good to that poor guy wrote to me because we exchanged numbers because like I said plant that seed his relationship
*  Might fall especially now that you've talked about on two different podcasts. No, he's gonna be so
*  Bob is that you I know okay?
*  His girlfriend is listening I just want to say he did nothing inappropriate
*  He never flirted me there was nothing he did that if he were my boyfriend
*  I'd be like he shouldn't have done that so the he
*  Behaved like a true gentleman did not flirt with me. I read into it way too way too much
*  but I
*  Mean, what you do? I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm on Raya. I'm on
*  Raya is a
*  Celebrities, right? I like a blue checkmark and it's not because I like
*  Guys that are famous because they're famous and I want to be famous it has nothing to maybe it has like a little bit
*  To do with that. I'm not gonna say is nothing to do with that
*  Yeah, there's something hot about a guy being extremely successful and other people thinking that he's cool. Okay. Yes
*  I'll give you that I think it's because I get I can I can know them before I go into the date
*  I can watch their stuff. I feel like I've already acquainted with them
*  That's why I like a blue checkmark it validate it like I can get to know you before I go on a date
*  I don't like going into these things blind
*  So that's that's why I like a blue check, but there's no one in st. Louis. That's on the goddamn app
*  No one no not one person. Um
*  Really? Honestly, no, there's no one in st. Louis on them. Where are they all New York and LA? Yeah or like Stockholm
*  I mean, it's all over the globe
*  It's global and so I'm connecting with some guys on that and and when I come to and then I just always get so busy
*  When I come here, I don't want to go on a first date with someone. I just want to hang out with my friends
*  I haven't seen in forever. I've been I've been into this book lately. It's called irresistible. It's about addictions downloaded it because I saw you recommend it and oh
*  My god, it's heavy, right? Yeah, I'm really scared
*  One of the things I was thinking about when I was going through it
*  Is dating apps like that's kind of the same
*  They have to be like how many people are having these random encounters because of dating apps
*  Yeah, how many people are it's like swiping left at which one is good, right? Right is good. Right means you like them
*  Yeah, so do you go to the right you swipe them, right?
*  So you go right you go right? Yeah, you swipe them left to right. Yes, you go from yeah
*  They're in the middle and then you swipe them right or you swipe them left and that means you like them
*  Left means no, you're fucked off. I never want to see you again and right means let's do it
*  And sometimes you go too fast on the left because sometimes you're just like, oh, what does this app think?
*  Fuck up and you go. Oh shit went right on that guy. Oh, you go back
*  I feel like Rose on the Titanic and Jack just fell into the abyss. Like I really feel like my husband
*  I'm just like
*  And you can't go back you can't you can shake the app very gently shake it
*  Yeah, you just like go like cuz at first I was going like
*  I
*  Wouldn't work because people told me just shake it'll come back
*  Wouldn't work but then I realized you have to like do one solid
*  You have to be like in control of yourself and then then it'll come back and then you see him wearing a tank top and you
*  Swipe him left again. You're like, oh my god disgusting tank tops are gross. No, I mean, there's always just I just find something about a
*  Guy that I can be like I can't deal with that. He'll like say his dog is his best friend or
*  My mom thinks I'm a catch or you know, some part of his personality is based on a food
*  He loves just anything kind of a pizza like that or like I love to get lost in a good book or just something
*  Want to cook for you whenever a guy writes that I'm just like
*  You're poor. I get I mean like you take me to a restaurant. I don't want to watch you cook
*  Let's just go sit down and I don't want to watch you have to like just because you've got
*  You know one of those meal kit delivery services
*  I have to sit and watch you chop cilantro and talk about your connection with your nephew
*  I'm never gonna remember cuz we're never gonna see each other again. Just take me to a restaurant. I
*  Don't know some of these guys are just trying their best. I just think it's so angry at these
*  So funny the thing that gets mad it gets you guys guys like yeah, I get mad at guys that cook I
*  Eventually cook for me. I'm like just shut up. I
*  Don't care. I don't really don't know and I don't cook it's not like I'm gonna take care of that
*  So I guess I would like a guy who cooks but I'd like more like a guy who just like I don't know what I want
*  I'm really this isn't fair to anyone. I don't know what I want. I want a guy who I already know
*  And I can hang around with and then develop a crush on and then I decide when we're gonna take it to the next level
*  You just want to be the boss
*  Kind of I want to be the one to be like, okay now we can even though I tend to like it when guys
*  Make the first move and kind of are
*  I got a guy
*  Nothing can come out
*  Disrespectful laughter. No, it's it's I know it's sad. I got a guy right now who um
*  He's like a he's a I would say
*  We're talking to an a-lister here. Yeah. Yeah, one of my first not not my first but he's definitely
*  He's definitely up there. I've known about him for years been a fan and we connected and
*  He just wants to sex with me and like have FaceTime sex and stuff like that like that's what without physical sex
*  Well, he lives in Los Angeles and I live in st. Louis. Oh whenever I'm available or in his area
*  He doesn't seem to want to meet up. So oh
*  It's just always he checks on him in on me every couple weeks and it's just like have you been in this person?
*  No, oh one time in person and then it went right to texting
*  That's weird
*  Someone who that's weird. I know I don't like it either. I'm like, can we hang out in person and then
*  Maybe I can
*  Virtually jerk you off or whatever
*  Me to do walk you through
*  Whatever it is you're doing to yourself
*  But I mean I just made the mistake of getting him off one time when he was texting like he always texted me at like
*  3 a.m. Oh, and it's just like how are you feeling like just checking in on my well-being?
*  in the middle of the night and
*  It's not it's nice. I really do think he like cares about me
*  But like there's some kind of weird and we both have intimacy issues
*  We've declared that to each other so something's going on there and we can't even see each other
*  I mean I lived in st. Louis with my parents and he's in here and
*  But you're here right now. I know I didn't let him know I was here, but I just I didn't tell him to find out
*  He has to talk about him on this podcast millions of people hear about it
*  No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no good
*  Aren't you friends with Nikki? Yeah? She's on the podcast talking about no. I don't think he tells anyone
*  I doubt he's told anyone that we're friends or text. I think tells one guy. Maybe one guy. Yeah
*  Well let him know let your friend know that I'm talking about him, but he I do I like he's he's
*  Well, we did this one thing
*  The other night
*  Because he texts me and then he wants to like have sex and I'm just it takes me a little bit of time to get
*  Like really horny for someone she just wants to jump into it right
*  I would just like to maybe just talk on the phone get to know each other go out
*  Like a regular person right I would like that to go on a date
*  I one time I wouldn't before covid he was in New York
*  And I was like let's meet up and he was like are you flirting with me?
*  And I was like oh this been going on a while I guess so covid's five six months. Yeah, yeah, Jesus
*  It's just off. It's off and on it's every couple months this guy like remembers that I exist. It's really he doesn't like me
*  There's no future here. He watched my special and he was like I think before my special
*  He didn't think much of anything and then he watched my special and I talked so much about sex he like thinks that I'm
*  Super super sexual even though I haven't had sex in like so long. I don't even know
*  Well, I think you're sexual but also sensitive that's what's going on it's not that you're not sexual
*  You're sensitive. You don't want to get hurt and you're also
*  Smart and you're you know you've lived on this planet long enough to know what fucks you up and what doesn't so you're careful
*  Yes, it's not that you're not sexual. Okay. I like that. You're pretty sexual really. Yeah, I would say you're very sexual
*  Oh good. I thought I haven't felt that way and I haven't hooked up in so long
*  Yeah, but you're not you're not around someone yes
*  That's oh, yeah, if I was around someone yeah like uncomfortable with that if I had someone to have sex with I'd be like your old
*  lazy-eyed
*  Lady come back in the day
*  Yeah, I can I can get addicted to sex pretty quick when I'm in a relationship and like having it
*  It's just an easy way to tap out and forget your feelings
*  Also part of the book
*  About irresistible it even talks about sex addiction gambling addiction really get into that book because I got distracted by my phone again
*  I mean, I'm reading it on my phone as I'm learning that
*  Yeah, that's so that was a part of it was I mean
*  That's what ever I feel like so many guys are sex addicts a lot that I deal with and like have
*  relationships with or like in communicating with I'm just like oh this guy's a sex addict and
*  And and a lot of them are famous I think that creates
*  I mean you can have sex with anyone you want when you're famous
*  Yeah, really really hard hot chicks really hot chicks. They throw themselves at you and you become their sex addict
*  You're like the woman you're the one who's being pursued. Oh, right? Yes, and so that's the problem with famous guys
*  Is there constantly they're they're too busy with like?
*  Really really hot chicks constantly being thrown at them
*  They don't really need to have a relationship where the I mean that's the appeal of having relationship for a lot of guys
*  I think it's just having a regular person to have sex with that's definitely one of it, and then there's also
*  this this book is talking about porn addicts and
*  Gambling addicts and and then it's really all the same thing
*  It's like your body and your brain gets fixated on particular activities and those particular activities
*  Occupy your mind so much and then it becomes a detriment to your life and it's with video games
*  It's with sex. It's with porn. It's with gambling. It's with drugs and that they used to think that they're different things
*  They used to think this and obviously drugs have like physical
*  consequences like heroin and you know and alcohol like alcohol is one of the worst to get off of because when you get off of
*  Alcoholic people were like legitimate alcoholics. They can die. Oh, yeah called Amy Winehouse. That's the house
*  She died no bulimia
*  No one talks about it. Let's Google that look it up because her documentary
*  She was puking her brains out at the end and that can cause cardiac arrest like that
*  mmm, and so I think I mean it could have been a mixture of both, but I
*  Do think her bulimia had a huge I listened to fucking her shit so often
*  She's on my like regular playlist. She's in so much pain. You can hear it in her voice
*  It was such a beautiful voice. It's an interesting voice
*  You know when she's singing about going to rehab, you know, hey, I was killed by bulimia not drugs says her brother
*  Yeah, drink and drugs took their toll but eating disorder fatally weakened Amy. Yeah, dude
*  How does some serious shit? What is the?
*  What is the the coroner's result though do they say the thing is a brother?
*  Yeah, no, I just think that that gets swept under the table so much eating disorders when really that is and you know
*  COVID is killing a lot of people with eating disorders to people that on the other side of that food addicts who can't stop eating and obesity
*  Makes you so much more susceptible to COVID. I mean, I yeah
*  I think I'd only know that because I've you know dabbled in all of those things before and it's terrible
*  Yeah, I'm a definite addict and I got to watch it. But this the sex addict thing
*  I mean, I just think that that's one that's unchecked for so many people and so acceptable and
*  Porn addiction. I mean I can't get off without watching porn. You can't get off at all. What are watching porn? Not even close
*  I wouldn't even try if my internet was down
*  We had a power outage the other day at my house and it was just like okay
*  Well, that's I would be screwed without I couldn't do it. I mean I would figure out a way I think I would
*  Manage, but if my if my toys aren't working and aren't plugged in and if I don't have porn
*  I'm just not getting off. I've never been someone who can do it manually and and with my imagination
*  It's really a problem because the porn I watch is like not
*  Good, what kind?
*  Joe
*  Joe Joe Joe
*  Dude it's bad
*  Step well stuff. No, that's tame. Are you kidding?
*  Yeah, really I mean I got a threat on
*  like a DM from just some fucking troll a
*  while back that was like if I put out a hit on the dark web for you to be gang raped and
*  Asked paid the guys a hundred thousand dollars to do it. I
*  Could make that happen and you know, someone would accept that and I was like jokes on you that that's
*  my fantasy
*  I don't really mean that please do not do that. But I was also like no that's I'm not
*  Joking like that tends to be the stuff that I watch is like really aggressive gang bangs and like women tied up
*  I I pay for my porn because I feel so bad what's happening to the women in it
*  I hope that they are being compensated for it. So I pay like 30 bucks a month for kink.com. I'm watching
*  really fucked up stuff
*  And I've always been to it been into like being tied up and like I'm someone who doesn't feel like I deserve
*  Pleasure without like having pain like I don't ever celebrate anything
*  And I can only celebrate or like relax if I put in so much work that I'm just like dead
*  So I can it's really hard for me to like enjoy myself in life
*  I always have to have it's I have to punish myself first and so orgasms are not something that like I feel I
*  Feel it's hard for me to give myself one and let myself have that much. It's like it's too much
*  It's like Christmas. You're like you have to wait a year for Christmas
*  You can't give yourself Christmas every day
*  So I feel I like to be tied up and like forced to have Christmas and like I Jesus Christ
*  That's what I that's what I tend to like is like you have to do this and because I'm so I don't like losing control
*  Either and the orgasm is like the most you can lose control
*  I just feel like I don't I don't like being in that out of control and I don't know what's gonna happen
*  I'm scared. I'm just gonna like shit everywhere or something. Like I'm totally scared of shitting everywhere
*  Is no one else scared of that
*  No, when they come I don't think I've never shit everywhere
*  We're saying something that you regret or like just do it. I don't know having a Kramer moment when I'm just kidding
*  No, just I'm terrified of what might happen
*  That's why I only have sex with people that I like trust so much so that if I shit on them
*  They wouldn't I know that that guy wouldn't hate me, right?
*  And they wouldn't tell people and that's why you're willing to let them tie you up
*  Trust them so much because if they tie me up and I shit, okay
*  Yeah, it wasn't my fault you tied me up I did no choice
*  Yeah, so if you're forced then you have you have
*  Yeah, you then it's not your fault what you did or what you said
*  So do you ever watch regular porn or is it always like no time ever? It's always I started kinked
*  I go to kinked calm. I go to anal. I go to bondage. I go to gang bangs
*  My problem is I do not like the women to be abused
*  I don't but you can't find gang bangs where the woman's being treated nicely. You can't find one where they're just like good job
*  You're taking on so much like I've talked about this in my special
*  But I thought after talking about in my special and saying can I please get a respectful gang bang?
*  Porn with listen and heed my request and make her bang gang bang when they're just like they're proud of her for her
*  You know tenacity and her
*  Strength during this really arduous journey
*  Personal journey and they're never nice to her. They're always calling her a dumb bitch. They're making her oink like a pig
*  They have a fucking boot on her head. They spit in her face and I honestly Joe
*  I'm not kidding you I watch porn with half the screen covered up because I don't like what they do to her head
*  But I like what they're doing to the rest of her because I just it's too they're so mean
*  You know choking her like doing a fish hook. I don't like any of that
*  But I like I like the idea of gang bangs
*  I like the idea of a girl being like kind of used and taken advantage of
*  And I do feel guilty about all this because I'm a feminist obviously
*  I love women and I want us to feel empowered and I'm so sad for these women
*  But that's what gets me off like I'm what a conundrum
*  Yeah, I don't want to be
*  But that's all that gets me off is watching women get fisted
*  I
*  Like that now I don't have any interest in being having that done to me. Why do you like so I say?
*  Oh my god, so thank you. I don't know what I'm even saying, but yeah, dude
*  I'm watching like it just it just is a slippery slope dude. It just gets
*  You know it you go from just like slight bondage where girls tied up and a guys maybe like doing some stuff to her with a
*  wand and like fingering her and
*  Choking her a little bit, and then it's it's just like seven guys
*  writing pig on a girl's head and making her oink and like and
*  And spitting on her. Did you bookmark those?
*  I mean I have I have a file
*  I have a file I have a I have an email that I send to myself
*  It's called porn I like and I just keep sending myself the next anytime I come from a video
*  I send it to myself so I can go back and I can also see my
*  My descendants into depravity through the years I can see where I started and where I'm at and how it happened
*  How long is this email chain been going on?
*  2017 is when I started it so I have a good backlog of wow
*  But what I like about this is that usually the girl is I don't like to see a girl in distress
*  I don't like to as soon as she I think that she's not having a good time
*  I get out of it because a lot of these girls are having a good time
*  They like to be pushed to the the limit one of my favorite porn actresses
*  And I just want to give her a shout out because she does brilliant work is Kristen Scott and one of her the best
*  Videos is called school of seduction. I think that's what it's called and or no
*  Fuck what is it called? It's there's like this Academy Academy that these girls go to where they learn to be sluts
*  And they have to like graduate and there's like five days where they go to the school and they're tied up and they're just like
*  Fucked by a bunch of people and they're made to like plank and get fucked at the same time as they're planking
*  And it's just like they're they get they just they have to do what you say when someone tells you you have to do
*  Something you have to be like oh, I guess I have to do it
*  It's not my fault that I'm a whore and they I just like that. That's what I'm into
*  Because I think I have so much guilt associated with wanting to be sexual or wanting to feel sexual that if someone's making me
*  Do it then suddenly it's not my fault
*  So do you think that's why you like bondage and gang banks is out of the person's control?
*  Yeah, yeah, and I was looking into like because I was feeling guilty about having like I don't have rape fantasies
*  I don't have that but a lot of women do so many women do and it's actually called
*  It's not a rape fantasy because you're not fantasizing about actually being raped because that's not consensual you want consensual not it's called
*  CNC consensual non-consent. That's what it's called and I'm kind of into that
*  It's um, that's an interesting phrase
*  Consensual non-consent. I know it's kind of murky but saying rape fantasy is just not
*  Right. I don't want to be raped by someone you don't want to have sex with
*  You want to be raped by someone you're really attracted to but you want to give in to it so you want it to happen
*  So it's it's sort of kind of rape but not really rape because you actually want it to happen
*  You want it to mimic you want it to be like role-playing rape?
*  So but you could stop it at any time because you have a safe word and you have all these things
*  But so it's it isn't rape so women that go I have a rape fantasy and think that's like quirky about themselves
*  You don't you really don't you don't want that. No one wants that
*  And so yeah, that's what it's called is
*  Consensual non-consent is what so many women are into and I read about it on reddit because I am in the subreddit sex
*  And it's just a very common thing that that that women want in bed with women like to be choked
*  They like to be bossed around they like their hair pulled they like, you know
*  But they only like it to be done by people they want it to be done. Yes. Yes
*  Very clear. Yeah. Yeah
*  Although there are sometimes that I
*  and I there are sometimes that
*  You know in some of these p0rns where the guy is like I'm not attracted to him and I wouldn't want his dick inside me
*  But I definitely like when they they treat you like a car they're working on and they just like use tools on you and there's
*  No dicks involved that appeals to me
*  That's a very popular one like if there was a place you go like a body shop. Yes get worked on. Yep
*  I would love it. There's a place you could go
*  where
*  Guys would just massage your vagina and use tools on you and you'd be totally down with that
*  Yeah, as long as there's no cameras and no one would ever talk about that. I was there
*  I mean, I'd be talking about it on here the next week, but
*  It was up to me you could wear a mask and and your
*  Masks, okay. Yeah, and just lay there and have them eat you out
*  No, I don't want them a mouth. You don't want the mouth. Maybe I don't know
*  Maybe after go there a couple of times you get bored with dildos. I don't I'm
*  Know dildos are so good
*  They're like dildos and toys are like amazing. I like a wand and I don't I don't even think I could have
*  Regular sex without also like a vibrator too. Yeah, I want I want penetration and I want something else too. Wow
*  Just what it's just I
*  Don't but what's the longest time you've taken without any masturbation or sex? Oh
*  Months and months. I can go months months without masturbating like it does not
*  But when I get hooked on it, like it's the same way I abstain from pot like right now
*  I've gone 12 days
*  But if I sparked one up right now, I'd be doing all this time until I go cold turkey and I just I quit
*  So I can I went a really long time without it
*  During the quarantine and then I haven't hooked up with I haven't had sex since for you know
*  a year and a half at this point and
*  And and I've hooked up a couple times in that in that time with guys, but I've always stopped it before I've even
*  Had like get been even close. I just knew I wasn't gonna come so I was just like just let's stop when you were talking about
*  Like gang bangs and stuff your hands you had like a death grip on your knuckles and you're like
*  Bringing your hands back and forth you're going over in your head. I'm like Jesus. Oh my god
*  I know I get really intense about it. Yeah, you were very intense about yeah sure. It's it cuz I well I feel really
*  Bad even admitting that that's what I'm into. Well, you shouldn't feel bad. That's
*  Not a bad person you're a good person
*  Into weird shit, but that's okay. I'm not the only one. Oh, there's a website
*  Yeah, kink comm is not supported by Nikki Glaser alone. No, they imagine it's like there was a chart. It's like it's all
*  You know we thought we had subscribers this one ladies. She's out of her fucking mind
*  He's a whole industry based her on this one broad
*  They kind of make more to because I am running out of videos to watch because it's hard for me to go back and watch old
*  ones so I've been going back and
*  Going cuz they've been around forever and I went back like, you know
*  68 pages and there's stuff from like pre 9-eleven. I'm like, I can't watch this woman from
*  2000 take on six guys later now
*  Picture her now
*  Where did her life take her? That's the problem, right?
*  So you think about what happened to them that allowed them to be that person the gangbang with pig written on their face
*  Yeah, that's the problem. That's the problem
*  And that's why a lot of videos on on kink comm have a pre interview and a post interview
*  So you see the girl go I'm really looking forward to this gangbang today. I've wanted to do this for so long
*  It's been a goal of mine. I'm really into this
*  I don't like this, you know
*  You see them consent to all of it and then happens and then they have the post one where they're like shivering in a towel
*  With like wiping pig off their forehead
*  And they're like that was fun and you see them and there's always a post interview to you know
*  Prove they survived. Oh
*  Rough do you get criticized for talking about this stuff like by other women?
*  I will after this for sure, but no generally not because I think I'm not alone with this one
*  You think why do you think you will with this one? Cuz you just you got really deep into it. Um
*  Just because you have a bigger audience
*  More people are gonna hear it. That's why but I think you're not alone
*  And I think there's probably a lot of women that are listening to this right now. They go. Yes
*  Same yeah, same I just tend to with my addictions
*  I tend to go from they get they get bad quickly like they so they start off so yeah
*  These are all progressive things like eventually
*  You'll get there with porn if you watch it long enough
*  It might take someone else thousands of years to get where I got in a shorter amount of time
*  But it all is leading to I mean it gets gross
*  That's why these things exist like you don't start off liking
*  Like a woman with a boot on her head like that's not something that like you go to you just slide there
*  Well, that's the thing about porn in general if you go back and you watch old porn
*  Old porn was just people on dates
*  Old porn was just people on dates
*  Was if you go back and watch like porn, you know like from the 80s
*  It's basically two people are hanging out and the one's like god. I'm just so tense
*  I've got such a headache the guy's like hey, let me rub your neck and rubbing the neck and it's like oh that feels so good
*  It feels so i'm so hot
*  I need to take my shirt off and they take their shirt off and then they start making out and then
*  I mean
*  Nothing for me now, yeah, but that's what it is
*  It's like it's basically just people having sex normal people in normal situations and then there's something about
*  Where people need to escalate?
*  Everything has to like okay. I've seen that now. I need to see more and that's what points to the fact that it's um
*  That it's an addiction. Yeah, you know
*  I've never been into anything other than just sex. That's so good. Yeah, luckily. Yeah, the only porn that i've ever watched
*  It's just girls with big asses
*  Just sexy girls. Yeah
*  I'd say just sex that's normal sex fetishy as you get it's
*  I've never
*  Never been into any of that. No choking nothing. It gets so weird joe. It is weird. There's so much
*  But i'm not even choking in real life either. I've never
*  Never been into that anyway. Yeah, I don't know why guys are into it. I don't relate to
*  I don't know that i'd want a guy to like want to do that to me. It's dangerous
*  Yeah, yeah, but because if you escalate so think about the escalation in porn
*  Well, what if a guy is into choking girls and then he gets bored with just regular choking?
*  It's like I want to use a rope like I promise i'm not gonna hurt you
*  I'm just gonna use a rope now. I want to you. What if it's just like a wire?
*  Just like a wire. Yeah, like i'm not gonna it's just make a little mark on you
*  Okay, what if I blindfold what if I hit you like and then things get weird? What if I murder?
*  Yeah, and then it relates. I mean that I was watching that golden state killer documentary and that's what that guy did
*  He started just doing break-ins and then that wasn't really itching it the scratch anymore scratching the itch anymore
*  Then he moved on to rapes and that was doing good for a while and then slowly he started murdering like it didn't just start
*  Out murder you saw his progression. It's like it. Yeah, this stuff can get really scary
*  I mean, I like being I think being choked is nice because I mean you were talking about it with david blaine yesterday
*  Like it feels good to like lose consciousness and like come out of it and be pushed to that brink of like
*  There's something
*  Uh euphoric about it. Yeah
*  I think there's the euphoric thing about getting choked out is like as the brain like rushes back to consciousness
*  There's probably a bunch of hormones and things that are just floating around in there they get fired up and also like there's there's like
*  Dopamine and all sorts of spikes. That's the other thing that they were talking about in this book
*  irresistible talking about the dopamine rush that people get from various addictions and
*  They were talking about Parkinson's drugs that this is really interesting because
*  Parkinson's medication apparently what it does is it spikes dopamine and it also
*  It it has a lot of really weird side effects like people get addicted to gambling they get addicted they give away all their stuff
*  there was a there's a drug called reequip and
*  Galaxos Smith Klein wound up paying this guy
*  Somewhere in the equivalent of like six hundred thousand dollars because he was a straight
*  heterosexual man with no problems with gambling and he had Parkinson's and he got on this
*  Reequip drug and he became a gay sex and gambling addict and he started having risky gay sex
*  Like really risky like he would contact people on Craigslist and meet the alley
*  And he was just gambling all his money away, but so much so that he won in court
*  suing them because
*  Google the story it's re equip and
*  The man I believe he's from Ireland and he won in court
*  It was like he wasn't a gay man was a straight man. Oh, right
*  All right, I mean I never even thought about it before
*  You know and then he became a gay sex and gambling addict. I had him in my act for a while, right?
*  I had the story in my act for a while like because
*  Apparently he would like like snap out of it like in the middle of doing stuff. Oh, yeah
*  Parkinson's patient wins lawsuit over gay sex addiction a
*  French man who also is French sad. I don't trust French
*  Look at his name Didier. That's too close to diddler
*  Didier Jean-Bart
*  52 of Nantes France sued the pharmaceutical giant Galaxo Smith Klein 2011 claiming the drug we
*  Reequip caused him to lose 82,000 euros gambling on the internet
*  He said he also became addicted to gay sex and risky sexual encounters
*  He said he was raped after starting the drug in 2003 and attempted suicide eight times
*  It's a great day Jean-Bart who was accompanied by his wife during the emotional ruling told the French press agency
*  It's been a seven-year battle with our limited means for recognition of the fact that Galaxo Smith Klein lied to us and shattered our lives
*  Parkinson's disease destroys neurons deep within the brain that releases the feel-good
*  Neurotransmitter dopamine reequip belongs to a class of drugs called dopamine antagonists or
*  agonists that relieve Parkinson's symptoms such as shaking stiffness slowly slowness and trouble balancing by activating dopamine receptors
*  But the drug has drugs have side effects that while rare can be serious
*  Yeah
*  But it's a weird things like even if you have the urge to do it you are not in control of your own actions when you
*  Requip finally give me some just give permission to do some stuff that I've always wanted to do
*  Have an excuse. Well, I wonder if it works on people who don't have
*  Parkinson's like what does it do to people who don't have Parkinson's?
*  Oh, right. I mean that's terrifying you will you will I would always hear that in the side effects of drugs
*  Like if you have are suddenly gambling out of nowhere and you're like, what is that?
*  This is a drug for a heartburn and if I'm gonna
*  Gambling out of nowhere. Come on, but it's totally it's scary these drugs
*  I mean that I'm trying to get on a new antidepressant because I've just been so just I'm tired of having these low
*  lows that just don't aren't necessary and are just scary sometimes because the things I think and the things I
*  I just have these thoughts that come in that can't stop and they just can't work
*  I can't be funny when I'm depressed
*  So I got to get it back on something
*  But I'm so scared of all these weird side effects and the things that it might make me do
*  Rightly so and so I'm I mean how long have you been on antidepressants?
*  I mean I was on them for years and years ever since I was like I
*  Got anorexic when I was like 18 and then I was so depressed from that because it just like starts eating your brain
*  That I got on stuff and then ever since then I've been I've struggled with depression. I think even before then I was a really depressed
*  Kid, I look at pictures and I'm just like staring despondently into a corner
*  Like on holidays. I'm like, oh, I was just depressed and so
*  now I'm looking into maybe having ADHD because it's often misdiagnosed in women because women don't really have the
*  hyperactivity part of it and it just makes us kind of depressed and have low self-esteem and
*  Messy and all the things that I am that you know
*  I'm sorry though about like messing with your brain chemistry with these drugs that like maybe they don't have the right stuff that they're giving
*  You and it might be causing other problems or exacerbating the current ones
*  No, because I've been off them for a while now and how long you been off them?
*  For a couple months. So you're not on anything and I've been gone through years of not being on stuff
*  Are you exercising? Yeah every day. What do you do? I run four miles a day. Okay, so you're getting a lot of exercise
*  Yeah, I do. I try to exercise a lot and it's still fucking with you and I eat healthy
*  Yeah, man
*  I just get all the sudden I just get these fucking thoughts that come in and then I'm depressed for like four days so badly
*  That I just I'm I could file for disability as a comedian because I cannot be funny
*  Okay, my brain doesn't work. You can file for disability. I should be able to
*  Yeah, because I can't do the thing that I I mean I feel disabled. I feel like that's when I start thinking
*  Okay, I got to find a new job. I can't do this. I can't be broadcasting every day
*  I have nothing interesting to say and I just that's not true at all. Everything you said today has been very interesting
*  Thank you. Well, I'm not in a bad place today. I'm actually out of it
*  I don't know it just comes on every like four days out of the month. Did you wake up?
*  You felt like I'm in a good place. Oh today. No, I've been in a good place since Saturday
*  I woke up on Saturday and I snapped out of it
*  But you know when I sent out that tweet the tweet that led to me even being here was because I was just
*  Suffering for like four or five days with like really bad depression where you know, I called Gary Goldman
*  Do you know what he went through? Yeah, he's been through like serious serious
*  Yeah, I was I I had a text drafted Neil Brennan
*  I wanted to talk to other guys that like have had to have had to go places and we'll actually did ketamine
*  No, yeah, he told me was wild. He said he went to a doctor
*  They you know, they put you in a chair like a regular doctor's chair and they induce you into a psychedelic state
*  He goes and I mean I was tripping balls. I go really he goes
*  Yeah, I went to the doctor's office and they give you fucking ketamine and you trip balls and I'm like did it help you?
*  He goes, yeah, he goes. Yeah, it helped ketamine apparently has a big effect on people that are
*  Depressed and some people are taking it, you know, like a spray like a mist. I don't know if it's nasal spray
*  Yeah, yeah, just like a body splash fucking Whitney has something like that. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's just I don't think it's a body spot
*  In front of you and walk through it your nose or your mouth, okay
*  Ketamine mist like a very low dose of ketamine. Yeah micro dose of ketamine
*  Well, I'm gonna talk to him about it, too
*  But it's so funny because when I when I'm in it I'm so in it and then when I'm out of it
*  I just forget that it can get that bad and I don't even think about it
*  I forget that it can get so bad
*  But there's no triggers that are making it bad or good right now like things are really not like are very uncertain
*  My career is going great by all
*  You know if you yeah by all indications, I should not be depressed like yeah, I have a loving family
*  I have my health but you say your career is going great
*  Everyone's career hit a wall. Yeah, all of us that are comics we hit a wall
*  Yeah, and mark the only one is touring regularly is Bert. I know he's depressed right now
*  He's fucking told you told me just did 19 shows or 15 shows in nine days. He goes. I'm fucking exhausted
*  I gotta stop and he goes in his agencies trying to push him to
*  Organize a summer tour or a fall tour now and I will I relate to I think that Bert is a lot like me that if
*  He does stop and stops working. Yeah, it will be so much worse than it was
*  He'll freak out and you know, he loves to drink too. Yeah, you know, he's got a lot of different things that he's sort of
*  Kind of whatever is going on in his head that he's trying to
*  Squash he does it with a lot of different things whether he works a lot or he just I mean he tours and we tours
*  He tours Bert will tour in a bus and hit a different place every night
*  And then it used to be that you invite people to go out and know with him
*  Yeah, maybe he has this expectation to fulfill as the the party animal and so he is always
*  I mean I feel for him always having to be on and be that guy and be shirtless and be down to party
*  Well, he was doing a special and they were handing him shots and he was like I can't do shots
*  I'm doing my special and they're like fuck you drink
*  He's like you're ruining my special. Oh my I'm filming a special here. This is for fucking Netflix you idiots
*  Yeah, what are you doing? He was mad
*  But if he's but there's part of me that goes maybe he should be fucked up if he's done all of the preparation for this
*  Fuck you've been fucked up right why the night you tape your special would you do things differently? Yeah
*  I don't do anything differently when I take specials. Do you
*  Get depressed. No, you never felt that I mean maybe like very low-level depression. Yeah, that's great
*  Yeah, cuz I feel work out like a terrorist. I know and what is that about?
*  I think I'm very primitive. I think my brain like what my
*  Genetics, I think I come from a long line of savages and I think the only way I feel good
*  Really feel good is to do very violent things. Yeah. Yeah, so push yourself
*  I need to I run hills. I beat the fuck out of a heavy bag
*  You're actually loving fucking love pushing yourself
*  But then how much do you love it when you're done I mean isn't that love it best feeling it's how I enjoy it while
*  I'm doing it, but I get to a place where I don't enjoy it. Yeah, that's I have to hit that place
*  You have to push yourself. Yeah, I don't I don't work out to like where it feels pretty good. Like there's none of that
*  I want to see you like walking a mall someday like doing a gentle mall
*  With tiny little weight hand with my dog we do hills
*  You know, I put like a weight vest on
*  I have a thing called an Atlas trainer
*  It's a backpack that I put Olympic weights on the back of it
*  Like has a like, you know, like you have a plate a barbell
*  Yeah
*  I get so like the dumbbell plates go over it and then I screw in this
*  Collar and I have like a Olympic plate on my back
*  And so I do I'll hike with those on with the dog and do you take days off though? Yeah
*  Yeah, I don't need is that hard to do no no, I don't think I'm addicted to exercise
*  No, you seem to have a healthy
*  But I'm careful lifestyle with everything I can get addicted to everything. Okay, you can oh, yeah
*  I had a real real problem with video games in the past
*  Eight hours a day like even more how interesting and irresistible is it that people who make those video games don't even let themselves play that
*  Yeah, how about that World of Warcraft story?
*  How about the one kid who's a football player who lost his fuck basically his life fell apart fell out of school
*  Everything just it can happen. I so you used to be that way
*  Yeah
*  We fucking set up a local area network in the back and we have all these computers back
*  Yeah
*  Then we set up and I had to stop playing them
*  Because we would be in here and I would be playing five six hours a day after podcasts, right?
*  And it was like for months and I had my stop and I had to get out of here
*  I'd be sweaty my adrenaline be all fucked up recently
*  Was it like a year and a half ago, yeah, buddy two maybe two years ago, what about drinking for you? What about no drugging?
*  No, no never never compulsive. Yeah. Yeah drinking the problem with drinking is it always has a
*  Negative physical effect. Yes, so that I'm not into things that fuck with my body
*  So when I do something negative then it fucks with my real addiction, which is the exercise addiction
*  So if I have if I have an addiction at all for physical exercise addiction
*  But it's not an addiction like I have to do if I don't do it I freak out
*  It's like if I don't do it, I don't feel good. Yes, like I like to be calm. I like to feel good
*  I like to be friendly. I like to feel like even
*  Mm-hmm. I don't feel even if I don't work out if I don't work out for four or five days
*  I just feel like real tense and like short trigger like short fuse
*  Something that sets you off with like your wife can sense it your kids can sense it if you haven't worked out like
*  What's gonna what's something that I don't let myself get to that? Oh, that's good. Yeah, I don't let myself get that
*  But how do you stop yourself?
*  This year. Yeah, I definitely do a lot of meditation meditation
*  Flow tank sauna. I do a lot of breathing exercises in the sauna
*  I do a lot of that, but I just know me I know me and I don't like me when I don't work out
*  Yeah, I don't like me if I don't meditate and I don't let myself get away with but it's also I also
*  Since the time I've been us a young boy. I've been doing savage things
*  So from like my whole life, I've been in martial arts. So my body is just like what are we hitting today?
*  Come on. What are we choking? Come on. We gotta go
*  And if I don't do that my body's like any day now we're gonna we're going to war like shit is about to happen
*  It's going down so your body starts getting and it's like a battery like you're storing up all this energy
*  And if you don't if you don't release it, it's like it's overflowing. It's coming off the top. And so I I
*  exercise just to maintain homeostasis
*  To maintain balance to maintain like just just just to be just have clarity
*  Yeah, so that's just the best version of yourself if you're pushing yourself 100%
*  I am the best
*  Person I can be when I when I exercise a lot now
*  What if you go through a time where you don't get a lot of exercise in you just can't fit?
*  Exercise I don't know fit into my schedule. What does that you figure you figure out a way?
*  You think that is the schedule like there's no like do what I forget to eat. Yeah
*  Do I forget to sleep? I don't forget to sleep. So why the fuck would I forget to exercise?
*  It's just an excuse ever gone more than a week in my life without exercising. Yeah, I mean doing something
*  I have to unless I've been injured unless I have like a bad injury like a surgery or something like that
*  What about stand-up addiction? I?
*  Think I definitely have a stand-up addiction and I think that I really it really I
*  Feel like if I have any depression at all, it's this low level low from not doing stand-up for all these months
*  It's a low and then I realized it when I did I did the improv in Houston
*  Yeah, and and it was like oh my god, we're back and I said like fuck it dude
*  I'm I went with Brian Moses and Tony Hinchcliffe and we were like dude, let's fucking just keep doing this
*  Let's just keep traveling around the country any place that wants to have us and then I started thinking I got really high and I started
*  Thinking what if I gave it to somebody? What if I got it?
*  I gave it to somebody and I can't do that
*  That was the thing that I feared what I feared the most is giving it to somebody
*  Yeah, I've given it to like some a guest that gets really sick. I know that's that's the fair. Yeah
*  Outdoor shows some people that are getting it it fucks them up for months
*  I know people don't ever recover people still haven't recovered that got it back in March. They have still a fatigue
*  They can't get out of bed. Yeah, their hair's falling out there. I mean these side effects they could last who knows forever
*  It's really scary. It's a weird fucking disease. It's a weird disease
*  It doesn't really make sense because it's not like any other disease like everybody who gets the flu you there's like it's real similar
*  It's not like one person gets the flu and it's nothing where another person gets the flu
*  And they can't smell anything for six months like people are they're losing their sense of smell
*  I know they lose their sense of taste like for months like Michael
*  Yo got it real bad where he was hospitalized and he is
*  He's still suffering for fatigue from fatigue like two months later
*  He would get tired walking up a flight of stairs
*  So you get like lung scarring and all kinds of weird shit happens. Yeah, okay
*  You're not scared of getting it no
*  What about all that shit? You're just scared of giving that to someone. Yeah, you just feel like your body's gonna be okay. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, I'll be okay. Do you get the flow? Yeah, but barely yeah, if I do so much though
*  I do like no IV vitamin drips all the time and I'm on all these vitamins and
*  Constantly working out. I mean I can get sick, but I don't get sick much and when I get sick
*  It's like it's goes by pretty quick. Yeah me too, but it's not but it's um, I'm keeping my body healthy
*  I eat elk meat and all this healthy food and it's like
*  your body if
*  Your body's in tune and your body's healthy and your immune system is strong. That's the whole point of having a strong immune system
*  it's supposed to be able to fight things off and I
*  Haven't gotten like a real cold in years
*  Because I take care of myself and I do a good job
*  But if I was working on a television show and I was not getting good sleep
*  Yeah, I was traveling a lot and I was not getting good sleep and that's when it can hit you and that's what it hit
*  Michael yo, yeah, he was just over. Yeah working. I mean Michael yo was he was he flew to New York
*  He was doing morning and did no sleep right flew to New York morning radio
*  television shows two shows a night at
*  Gotham two shows the next night same thing morning radio TV shows hustle and doing everything you can flies home
*  No sleep, right then drives to Vegas with his family kids in the car screaming
*  Yeah, and then he hangs out with his wife's family in Vegas and then flies back the same day
*  so two in front was just four hours there four hours back then
*  Auditions the next day and auditions the day after that. So he's practicing for auditions getting ready stressed out then it hits him
*  Boom hit some hard. Oh, yeah that
*  Mean that used to be the way I lived my life too. He gave it to his mom his mom kicked it in a day
*  Oh, really one day. Yeah, cuz she wasn't sick. She wasn't worn out. So her immune system did its job
*  What about you and sleep? What's your sleep? You're good at sleep. Yeah, you never had to take anything
*  No, what do you do? What's your kind of routine to wind down?
*  Do you keep the phone on your bed and like yeah, I don't I mean occasionally I'll have the phone by the bed
*  Before I go to bed, but I just conk out are you monitoring your screen time after reading this? Yes
*  Well, I was monitoring my screen time already. Can you get sucked into Instagram? I mean, what's your app that you just get?
*  No, YouTube. I like watching videos. Yeah, it's distracting. Yeah, I just get bored and I don't do when you work out
*  What YouTube? Yeah, like when you're like on a treadmill or something. What are you doing?
*  Are you just like in the moment trying maybe I'll watch it fights
*  Okay, if I'm watching something I like I watch fights or I listen to a book and I work out
*  But most of oh, yeah
*  I was wondering like about picturing you reading a book like do you just like sit in a chair and like flip through a book?
*  Like how does Joe Rogan read a book most of the reading I do is audiobooks. Okay, so most of me not reading
*  Yeah, well, that's reading is like scientific articles. I read like things that you can't get in audiobooks
*  But I do most of the most of the information that I get from books is either driving or in a sauna
*  I like listening in the side put air pods on you can use air pods in the sauna even at 180 degrees
*  Jesus they don't conk out. So I do are you in there 30 minutes? Okay, I used to but that's another thing
*  It's like I keep escalating that you said it's 20 minutes
*  Now I moved it like I don't be a pussy you make it 25 minutes and then it's like 30 and I'm not satisfied 30
*  So now it has to be 31. Yes, so you understand my porn thing. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
*  I just don't have the porn thing that way my porn is like if I watch porn, it's normal
*  It's people that are horny. They fuck that's that's the or yeah, or it's like, oh, we probably shouldn't be doing this
*  You know like that kind of porn, right, you know
*  Stuff like that, but nothing nothing crazy. Okay. Yeah, but I get it like I get all of it
*  Like the video game thing I get more than anything because I've had like real
*  To hear that even recently you've struggled with that because you seem to be someone who doesn't have to deal with but it's all because I'm
*  Calculated about it. That's all it is
*  Yeah starting to affect your well-being I went cold turkey with you go you quit it you can't quit
*  And then we played again when we had the guys who make doom we had them come in here and we played for a day
*  And even that day I was like I got out of here all shaky. I was like, I can't do that again
*  I don't do that again
*  Do you do you feel like you're white-knuckling it?
*  I'm missing out but you have just amazing discipline
*  Well, the video games are so addictive because they're so immersive and the one we're playing is quick champions
*  So you put these headphones on like if Jamie was playing with me if he was over here
*  I could hear him over here hear him walking and the video the graphics are so incredible and it's a three-dimensional game, right?
*  So you're running down these hallways and people are shooting rockets at you and you're jumping up off these things and you're running through
*  The water and people chasing you is
*  It's exciting that's as good as going on a hike no
*  Why?
*  Because first of all because you're you could do it all day
*  No vitamin D. No vitamin C. You're doing it all day, right?
*  Yeah, hours and hours and hours and you get exhausted afterwards and it becomes a compulsion like you leave here
*  You're driving you think about all he should have shot me then. Yeah, I should have got him and that time I fucked up
*  I shouldn't have gone into the lava. I should have
*  You have all these crazy thoughts in your head about the game and it's like I
*  They're really fun. That's the problems. They're really good
*  But for me at least they waste too much time and I get too sucked in and then it becomes unhealthy
*  Right because it becomes a like you can only exercise so much, you know, especially like the way I'm doing
*  Yeah, tell us how much that is because you definitely hit
*  The summer half a day, yeah, that's it. That's it. No more than that
*  These people that are at the gym for four hours at a time. I'm sorry. That's an addiction
*  Maybe that point you're and let's your training for something. How are you doing?
*  You can't hit the bag for four hours, right? I guess people are kind of like goes me in about I'm doing like I do rounds
*  Like so I'll set the timer for three minutes. It's like a timer
*  It's like ding ding ding ding ding it goes off and it lets you know every 30 seconds
*  So I have this ringside timer and it says an interval timer
*  So every 30 seconds it gives you a being it gives you like a curves gym, right?
*  So sort of so in 30 seconds, you know
*  You're sprinting for 30 seconds and then you're you're you're doing it at a slower pace for the next 30 seconds
*  And then you're sprinting again and there's a red light
*  There's a red light and then there's a yellow light and it's a red light is when it's time to stop
*  The yellow light is when you're calm and then in blue light is go so it has these three lights, right?
*  Go means sprint yellow means coast red means stop. And so it's like this very regimented, you know exactly when you're done
*  So when I'm doing like especially like rounds in the bag
*  You can only do it so much because your body breaks down because during those the blue time. It's just chaos
*  It's 30 seconds of just assault. You can't keep that up. Yeah, it's just too crazy. It's just
*  And then when it's over and then the next 30 seconds, it's calmer
*  It's like you're just sort of like getting your heart rate down and just going through the techniques and moving and then the blue light
*  Comes on again thing
*  So you can't you can only do it for so long, right? Yeah, but when it's over I'm like, ah
*  Chirp chirp chirp birds and love and everybody's my friend. Yeah, I feel good that way after a
*  After a hard workout too. I mean, I mean you need it you get the endorphin rush
*  But you also you beat the demons down. Mm-hmm
*  That's the thing is all the aggression just goes out of me like all the the pent-up stress and I just think that my body's
*  Conditioned to do this. It's been doing it for so long that if I don't do it
*  It just like goes when is it coming? When's it coming? Yeah, when's the war? When's the chaos?
*  And when's it coming you need to do you?
*  Cry ever I cry for happy things. Yeah, most of the time I cry when I'm happy for good
*  But I cry if I think about you know, like people that I miss and you know stuff like that. That's good
*  I definitely cry. Yeah
*  Well, I cry a lot for like things that make me happy
*  That's that's really yeah, that's cute. Yeah, I cry for people. I cry when I'm happy for people
*  But yeah, I cry. I feel that yeah, I'm not scared of emotions. Yeah, you know, I'm nice. Yeah, I'm
*  Scared of weakness. I don't like weakness, but I don't think crying is weakness. I think it's weak to not want to cry
*  I think it's not it's weak to not want to embrace the full spectrum of life
*  You know and life is filled with beautiful things and amazing things and it's also filled with horrible things
*  Like they're all there and to deny that I think is to deny reality
*  It is and that is to be delusional. I'm afraid of being delusional more than I'm afraid of crying
*  I think it's really important that you just said that you cry and you think it's important
*  I think so many people that listen to you do not so many men don't cry Joe, you know that they do
*  I think I don't think you know
*  Well, maybe they don't but I just don't think they'll allow themselves to and I'm I put myself in that category
*  like it's really hard for me to cry like I have to I
*  Have to be talking to someone about my I have to have that kind of mirrored back to me my emotions
*  So that I have license to cry but it's not something that that comes naturally to people but I think it's important to do
*  We have a child cried on the podcast is real recently. Really? Yeah
*  There was a guy who was on Josh Dubin from the he's a lawyer and they were talking about the innocence project
*  he works with the innocence project and they got this poor man who was an immigrant I believe he's from Guatemala who
*  Was unjustly accused of murder and they they got him out and you know
*  They were just going through the whole story about all the prosecutors are trying to keep him in jail
*  Even though he knew he was innocent and they they finally got him released and they're talking about this thing and I just start crying
*  Yeah, this poor guy is thinking about this guy who like makes his way to America to try to do better for himself and
*  It winds up getting caught up in this this fake murder
*  Accusation and yeah. Yeah, I cried about that. Yeah, I just I think men need to cry more and
*  And I have another one of your folders yeah men crying and then I'm seriously turned on by men crying
*  I love it. Can I really put that out there? I the one time my ex-boyfriend cried in front of me you got hot I
*  Was blowing him while he was like still like sniffling like still what his tears were like hitting me on the head
*  I'm not joking you it was I felt so inappropriate doing it
*  This is so hot that you were opening up and you were
*  Loading and then I don't have to deal with these feelings on in another way
*  Which is you being mad at me or you like bottling up your anger?
*  I mean these feelings have to come out somewhere just was so
*  erotic to me to see a guy like
*  So sensitive I think it's very weak of people to be afraid of feelings
*  Yes, there's nothing wrong with feelings, but there is something kill you there's something wrong with being a bitch though
*  Like this is a difference. This is what's important. There's something wrong being weak
*  There's something wrong with like shirking your responsibility or not doing the things that you know
*  You're supposed to do because you want to cry and wallow away all your day and feel sorry for yourself
*  Like I I do not support people feeling sorry for themselves because that's it. There's a perspective. There's a
*  Particularly with men there's a perspective you can change your perspective
*  You can you can just take action and do things there's nothing wrong with feeling sad
*  There's nothing wrong with feeling emotional
*  But there is something wrong with feeling sorry for yourself
*  And there's a lot of men who feel sorry for yourself for no fucking reason really
*  feeling sorry for yourself is
*  important why because
*  We that's that allows you to feel those feelings to say you know what I had I had a shitty childhood
*  A shitty mom and I got a I got a fucked up deal
*  I was I that guy from Guatemala that came here like he should feel sorry for himself his life got
*  I don't know if he should feel sorry for himself. I definitely think he should feel the pain of what happened to him
*  I mean, there's no way he can't and I definitely think that you know
*  He should feel happy that he's been released and that these wonderful people work really hard
*  And then I also think you should feel some anger that these motherfuckers wanted to keep him in jail when they knew he was
*  Innocent I mean I think there's nothing wrong with all those things but to be
*  To just be paralyzed by that and not do anything and then use it as an excuse to never live your life fuck that
*  That's the difference and that is a choice and that is also something that you get you learn as a man
*  There's people that can
*  There's people that you can count on and there's people that are gonna fall apart and there's a difference
*  There's there's moments in your life where you can be dwarfed by that moment or you can rise to the occasion
*  Okay, and who you are forever is dependent upon how you react to those moments and you could just decide I can't
*  Everything's just too hard and you just be a bitch or you can go. Yeah, this is hard, but I'm gonna do it
*  Anyway, I'm gonna get through this and then you learn. Oh, I could do it
*  Oh, I could move forward and the people that learn that they need to tell other people that they learn that and then other people
*  Can learn it as well. It's it's a reaction to pain a reaction to bad feelings
*  but to take action to be a person who actually
*  Recognizes that these feelings are normal, but you still have to keep going you still have to move on with your life
*  That's the difference because that makes sense
*  There's too many people that just use whatever happens in their life as an excuse for why they're a failure
*  Or uses an excuse for why you know other people do well
*  Well, I can't because this happened when I was young just right just fucking get up and go just go
*  I think you can do that after you acknowledge like you can let yourself feel sorry for yourself a little bit
*  Don't sit in that too long
*  But if you always because I think I'm just speaking more to myself because I've had to actually seek out
*  therapists who teach me how to feel sorry for myself because so much of
*  Me is like what are you complaining about? Look at your life shut. Come on. You don't have anything to cry about
*  Don't feel sorry for yourself. Don't do that. And then I never get to feel sad
*  They go my god that sounds really hard and I go well, it's people have it worse. It's fine. No, let's go back
*  You were scared then you didn't get the support you needed. That's really that's not fair
*  That sucks that that happened to you. Will you feel that?
*  Will you feel that you needed a more support back then when you didn't get it and you were scared and you didn't know
*  Any different because you were a little girl
*  They take me back there and they go feel feel sorry for her feel sad for that girl
*  And I have to go back and kind of let myself go feel sorry for myself
*  Is there a relief in doing that yeah
*  I think it allows me to stop pushing all my feelings down and being like I gotta be brave
*  I can't complain because what are you crying about you?
*  You have a roof over yet. You have parents who love you
*  But once they do that, is there a build up afterwards like a build back up or they're like, okay now that you've acknowledged
*  The fact that you're validated or you you have valid feelings and that there's a reason why you felt fucked over
*  Is a reason why you felt abandoned now that you've like let's look on positive aspects of Nikki Glaser
*  Let's look at life. Let's look at let's have some perspective. Do they do that?
*  Um, we haven't gotten there yet because we haven't heard all the trauma. That's the worry
*  The what my worry is that there's merchants that there's they there's there's something very valuable in
*  Selling pity there's something very valuable in in dwelling on these moments of your life that have been bad
*  And I think there's something in what you're saying that is valid before you were dealing with this where you're saying look at your life
*  Like you've got it better than a lot of people. What are you complaining about like?
*  Not that you should look at it that way
*  But that there are positive and negative ways to look at things the thing about
*  Having bad child having a bad childhood and having bad childhood experiences is
*  That it makes you a more interesting and resilient person
*  And that is undeniable. Mm-hmm
*  And that I think is something that it's very difficult for people to come to grips with when they look at their childhood
*  And they look at bad aspects of their life. They want to dwell on I'm like, okay
*  Get that out of your system
*  Then I want you to look at it this way that has given you a depth that most people don't possess
*  Yeah, and that's why you're interesting
*  I know everyone that I know who's interesting has had some fucked up childhood and as a parent
*  It's weird because I want to protect my children from adversity, but yet all of my favorite people
*  That's gotta feel because you want to make the best you want your kids to be funny you want them
*  Yeah, that's usually the case. It's like whenever I see someone who's just like sometimes you meet someone who's like stunning
*  But they're all so funny and you're like what how and then you're like, oh you were molested. Okay
*  That makes sense you had you had to go through something fucking awful to develop a personality
*  So you're right. I mean I I'm so grateful for
*  Those times when I was little and scared and confused and felt abandoned and all these things and I had great parents who did
*  They couldn't have done better. It but I was just a sensitive child who needed a little bit more but
*  But I I don't think it's it's serving me anymore to just suck it up
*  And say what are you so sorry about? What are you so sad about? You shouldn't be so sad because I really struggle with that
*  That's why I keep asking like are you depressed Joe? Do you know anyone?
*  I need to find people who are depressed that my life is so good though
*  Yeah, the problem is if like if I was depressed it would be like really disheartening for everybody
*  But that has a life that's not as fortunate right, but I'm I think my depression is also is chemical
*  I mean, I think it's just like my brain was born that way
*  There's nothing my parents could have done differently to make me not suffer with depression and that that I just have to I have to feel
*  I have to feel sad like oh that sucks that I have a brain that tells me to kill myself
*  once a quarter and
*  That I have to have those thoughts and I think those thoughts are right and I know that I'm not gonna act on those thoughts
*  But that sucks that I even have to have them
*  Is there a correlation though between how well your life is going like when your life is going great and how good you feel?
*  No, no, so that's that's the best my life has gone is some of the worst times
*  That's where there's a real solid argument for the chemical imbalance, right?
*  Because there's some people that I know that have had depression
*  But they've only had it when their life was in the shitter
*  Like when a girl left them or when they lost a job or things started going then they got depression and I'm always like
*  Hmm, what is the difference between depression and not doing well? So you feel bad? Yes, there's a difference
*  The chemical depression that you're discussing that's the real shit
*  That's like the real mental like there's a there's like a clogged pipe or something
*  Yeah
*  It's not going through and it doesn't and I and you look at your life and you look at everything that's going on and you
*  Just it doesn't make sense why you feel so sad or why you feel like such a fraud or why you feel like
*  You should kill yourself. I mean like right what what is that?
*  I don't know and and and and the thoughts are so they're not even like I
*  Sit down and go I want to feel sad and like think of ways to kill myself
*  It's like I'll just be sitting there and I'll be like kill yours like like whisper like I'd not I don't hear voices
*  But they're just they're not thoughts. I want to have the thought is like wallowing it really it
*  Yeah, I mean I really I compare it to feel it getting a cold like it just I feel it coming on
*  I'm like, oh shit. There's a lot and I don't know what you get these right when you close your laptop after kink.com
*  Usually that's what I'm feeling pretty good
*  That's what I'm feeling the best is after I've done that
*  I don't have that depression that people have of like regretting
*  I mean I'm disgusted about talking about all these things that I'm into when and I and and
*  Honestly, I only masturbate once every two weeks. So this isn't like an addiction for me
*  It's just but when it comes on it comes on a freight train. Yeah when I open my laptop
*  I am to go going into war at a anal graduate
*  Three like it just women who are going through some kind of master's course Tom
*  Segura sent me a video the other day
*  I'll show it to if you like but I don't remember what I sent him
*  But he sent me a video of this young lady were just saying hey laying on her back
*  And she's just punching herself in the vagina. What it's just go
*  And it's just going it's just going in and I'm like what in the hell
*  I have learned so much about the plasticity of
*  Vaginas and assholes. It's crazy King calm. It's crazy. It doesn't seem like it should be real
*  A lot can go on. Yeah a lot can fit up there that you just can't even believe
*  There's just something so like oh my god. Wow
*  Yeah, it looks like she's playing that prices right game where you punch through she just keeps going in there. Oh
*  She's so angry her face oh
*  That's what I'm saying
*  No, no, no, no, no
*  Doing it for a long time too by the way
*  Yeah, Tom if you ever need like something fucked up to look at holler at Tom, okay
*  Tom's yeah, Tom and Christina's got some fucking weird shit got his finger on the pulse
*  Oh, yeah, did you see the one of like the balls being shit out of the ass? That was so that was kind of
*  Weirdly beautiful well very unusual yeah first of all to have balls that will make it all the way to your ass is weird
*  And then not just make it all the way to your ass, but go inside like all the tucked inside like he's laying eggs
*  This stuff he puts on to it
*  Mean that guy's been practicing that girl that was just violently fisting herself
*  Had to like prop up her camera across the room and then go scoot or somebody else is filming it
*  Oh, yeah, that's yeah, but the guy with the balls up his ass apparently
*  He lets guys fuck him in the ass with his balls in his ass and his favorite thing is fucking guys
*  While he has his own balls in his ass
*  Yeah, okay
*  Okay, like hey listen you can't judge I
*  Certainly can't it makes me feel less alone than there are people out there that are in the weirdest stuff than I am
*  There's people in a weird shit
*  That's the weirdest thing about human sexuality is the spectrum of it like how much?
*  How we like one thing that you would say to another person would turn them on another person would never call you again
*  Yeah, fucking freak yeah, they'd run away from you. I know and that's why you know so much of stuff on kink.com
*  I'm just like get off of her feet. I don't need you to be doing that
*  Why are you that hurts her nipples take those off her nipples like that all the extra stuff?
*  I just want very I wish I could just I need to just produce my own porn. I think maybe that's your future
*  Possibly I mean I don't really want to be in it
*  But I would like to get behind the camera and make the videos that I'm craving isn't the thing about porn though
*  Is that like the girls never really make the money?
*  It's always the producer and the reason why people are tuning in is for the girl
*  Yeah, but the girls never the one who's getting rich. It's always the people but I don't know if anybody's getting rich anymore
*  I mean, maybe I guess they must be they must be making some money, but fans yeah
*  Yeah, but that goes to the girls right mostly yeah, but when I was when I first bought
*  Not the house. I'm living in now, but another house in the past. I had a neighbor who was balling out of control
*  He always had these like like really nice Mercedes-Benz parked in his driveway and Porsches and shit
*  he always was wearing like big fat watches and shit, and he was a porn producer and
*  He was laughing around about you know how much money made from porn
*  But then the internet came along and it was so quick
*  It was so quick where the internet killed his business because this is you know we're talking about I
*  Guess it was like the 90s the early 2000s
*  He was making all this money, and it was DVD sales right and then all of a sudden the internet came along and online
*  porn and bandwidth just kicked up to the point where you could actually stream it and
*  They foreclosed in his house, and I'll never forget that I'll never forget like finding out that that guy was losing his house
*  And I was like wow because that guy was always like so flashy like everything was like gold chains
*  And he had a fucking silver tooth, and he was doing coke all the time and always had girls over his place
*  He was just making so much money. Yeah, it was from selling porn
*  It was not the girls weren't making that money. No. There's like I mean there's been a few girls
*  I'm sure that have made a lot of money in porn, but it's real rare. It is rare. There's like you know like
*  Yeah, it's not it's not the girls that I'm seeing on kink.com in fact
*  There's a great documentary on Netflix called hot girls wanted that talks about oh, I heard about that
*  I haven't it's so it's so upsetting these girls
*  They find these girls like post ads on Craigslist
*  And they find girls that are fresh out of high school that just want to get out of their small town
*  And they're promised to make a thousand bucks a day
*  You know if you do like six shoots, maybe and they burn out within like four months
*  And they make they shoot all these videos that are up forever forever
*  And then they and they get really sick their vision they get like
*  They get over too much use down there, and they have to go to the doctor
*  And they have different abrasions and certain things and that's how they get and they then they're doing really fetish II type stuff
*  There's one girl that is in it that has to do like a brutal session which kink.com has a lot of brutal videos
*  Which I hate that word in porn because that's usually like do you just see girls that you're like oh?
*  She she could not have left that shoot feeling empowered about herself no matter what I mean
*  That is it's just so sad what they say and do these girls and in that in that movie
*  There was one girl that was like yeah
*  I went to a brutal session today, and I had to and she you could just see like the life
*  Lost in her eyes, and these girls just last they I mean a year is a really long time for them to last
*  They think it's gonna be like this glamorous life. I mean they're so young, but that's well when you're 18 years old you're
*  Basically a kid yeah, you're not really I mean you're an adult only on paper and in size
*  You know but you're a kid like your minds not formed yet, and your ideas of what what's okay?
*  What's not okay? They don't they're not pay for your plane ticket to go to Miami
*  Live in this house with a bunch of other porn stars
*  It's like this shitty fucking apartment with the producer who lives with you, and you're taking care of his dog
*  I mean it's it's you got that documentary is really incredible and and makes you second-guess where where your porn comes from
*  That's why I got to pay for mine
*  But it's also the way people look at you forever like if you have a sexual
*  Relationship with a person and someone does crazy shit to you
*  That's just you what you wanted and you both did it and that's okay like you know and
*  People maybe people will laugh, but they don't have to see it all the time right the thing about
*  Porn with a woman is if a woman does like some crazy gangbang or something like that
*  That's always gonna be there and some guy is you know like hey that girl
*  Are you gonna marry check out this link and someone sends you this link and you go? Oh my god, and you see
*  You see her as if she's right there right now doing this
*  I know you don't see her as if a person is a person who made a mistake when she was 18 and did this thing
*  But now she's 30 and your lover. No you you still she's broken and damaged
*  Get over that
*  Hopefully, but a lot of people are a lot of people can't yeah do that a lot of people they won't be able to
*  rationalize or
*  Objectively look at this and go listen she made some mistakes some people you know some people went to jail for shoplifting
*  And then you know they realized you shouldn't steal and then you know they get out and then they live a normal life
*  No one goes. Oh, yeah, but look you're a shoplifter forever, right? Right although
*  You know I relate to some of these porn actresses just in the sense that I've said things and
*  Done things on stage or like that. I'm like oh, no. That's always going to
*  Someone's going to my husband someday might watch this yep, and be like look what you were into and what you admitted
*  Yeah, but you are a grown woman. You're not a child
*  Right and a man like one but a man who's into that like who's into you would go
*  She's just being honest. I'm just being honest. Yeah, I think that's what I just try to be and I that's empowered
*  I mean it really it's kind of fucked up to be empowered that way
*  Because you know what I mean because the people wait a minute you're empowered by watching girls get gang raped and gagged and fucking
*  pissed on itself
*  No, no, but uh, but I'll get there
*  You can you're a grown woman you can find a man who recognizes and respects you for what yeah
*  You're shit. You're into as a grown woman, but when you're 18 years old you're not even a no you're not a grown-up
*  I know just not you know you're a person who's like legally responsible for yourself because you're an adult
*  It's fucking weird
*  It's a weird thing because even just regular porn just regular sex
*  It's strange that we all want to have sex but no one
*  Wants to see the person that they have sex with having sex with someone else on film. I know
*  Even though you know that they have had sex before you're like blah blah blah blah blah
*  No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, it would be interesting to hear I mean how
*  Boyfriends of people who have done porn I mean some guy I think some guys can just handle it and they can be okay
*  I like it. I I like when I I like hearing about if I'm with my ex-boyfriend
*  Not porn, but I would if he made like sex tapes with other girlfriends. You'd want to watch them ha ha ha I would
*  Yes, yeah, I love it. We gotta put these in a bank vaults
*  I would watch them all the time. I would want to hear about them all the time. I'm really into that
*  I really love hearing about
*  ex-girlfriends or even
*  You know I hate to even say this because it just sounds
*  Ridiculous, but and maybe I'm not into it anymore
*  But when I did the last time I had a boyfriend years and years ago
*  I wanted him to go have sex with other girls and like tell me about it really yeah
*  And
*  And Dr. Drew has told me that there's something wrong with me, but that's what I like like that's not it
*  It's not wrong with dr. Drew. How about that? Yeah, maybe yeah? He's not perfect. He's not no
*  but I
*  Yeah, I like that. I like
*  He said that that Nikki he made me look him in the eyes and tell tell him I'm enough
*  You are enough Nikki look at me. You are enough. You are enough
*  I don't want my ex. I don't want my boyfriend
*  To bang someone else because I don't think that I can be enough
*  It's because I like you think it's hot
*  I just think it's hot and I and I don't feel threatened by it
*  I really don't because most of the time if you let your ex if you let your boyfriend bang someone else
*  They don't really want to it's like almost like
*  Giving them the license takes away the fun of
*  Cheating so it's kind of hard to find guys that are into this and I don't always want this now listen to this podcast
*  They're gonna come floating in your DM saying this for years and no one's hitting up
*  But the guys actually don't like this because they want they want their women to only want them
*  And it's not that I don't want them. I want I if I'm I want girl
*  I'm very turned on by guys who other girls want to fuck like I like having a guy mean like he's mine and you
*  You can't have them if you want like I get him and I know you want to fuck him
*  But you can't but actually you can and he's gonna tell me about it later
*  And you're gonna think that you're gonna like steal him from me, but you're not we're gonna talk about you behind your back later on
*  And I want her to have a really good time. Dr. Drew's right now. Just screaming taking his headphones off
*  You're enough. You are enough. I know I'm enough, but I just there's it's just
*  What did he how did he how did you guys resolve the conversation?
*  Well, he was the one that was told me that I need to go see a therapist that like helps me feel my feelings
*  I like found my therapist cuz dr.
*  Drew was like you need to go to emotionally focused therapist cuz you don't feel your feelings and you need to find someone who like really
*  Mimics your feelings back to you mimics
*  Yeah, because I don't really let myself get sad or get mad and you know
*  I just I kind of just I'm always running from one thing to the next cuz I don't like to I don't like to feel at all
*  Hmm
*  Yeah, but it's but he just said that yeah my that compulsion to have but it's always been there like I whenever I'm with
*  The guy I want to hear about like when was the last time you hooked up what happened?
*  Where what did you do? What like I want to know all the things and they think it's a trap
*  They're like, oh you're gonna get jealous and this is gonna lead to like fights later on
*  But I want to like hear about it and talk about it. And I don't know it just it really does it for me
*  I
*  It's a weird thing and he rejects that yeah
*  He thinks he thinks that it's it means that I have low self-esteem, which I'm not denying I
*  do
*  But that's not what it is. I don't but I don't think that's where I mean, maybe that's where it comes from
*  But it does it is I think it's a sexual kink. Yeah, it's not I'm not a cuck. I'm not in the corner like
*  Like like sad about like a girl be a cuck
*  Yeah, I didn't know a girl could be a cuck sure they could
*  My wanna would stop fucking my boyfriend like I can see that but no I'm like in the corner like do it and I don't
*  Even want to be involved. I'm just like, haha. I love it. She's getting it and like and I'm not
*  I don't know why I'm not just I first of all
*  I've been fucked by enough guys who haven't wanted to be with me afterwards
*  So I don't think that my boyfriend's gonna fuck someone and be like I need to marry her if anything
*  He's gonna be like I need to get away from this chick. Like it'll it'll make him not want to fuck
*  Yeah
*  That usually does it based on my experience when you have sex with the guy
*  He doesn't really want to hang out with you afterwards. That is hilarious
*  So the way to keep your man is to let him fuck other girls that way
*  He won't want to be with them anymore. Yes, and if he does want to be with them go be with them
*  Why I don't want to keep you from that
*  But I just I have a lot of self-esteem in terms of like I'm a cool chick
*  I feel like yeah, I'm a lot as you said on the last podcast and I was never gotten out of my head
*  I am a lot and that's a good thing that that bothered you when I said you're a lot
*  It didn't bother me, but it I felt seen
*  Scene I just felt like I yeah, I felt like wow he I don't know. I I just I I
*  Didn't know what to think of you
*  Before we have hung out and we really only hung out on the podcast
*  Which is like a real hang? I mean, this is no different than if we were alone together and just hanging out as comics, but
*  Yeah, I just felt like my god
*  You really you just show you showed me a part of myself that I was maybe denying cuz I just
*  Picture myself like I'm such a cool chick. I'm so fun and easy
*  Like why does anyone like me and then you go well, you're a lot and it was just like
*  Fuck like maybe I'm not the total package that I think I am and that's okay
*  I'm a lot is not bad. It's not okay. No, it's not when I say you're a lot. It's like whoa
*  There's a lot going on there. It's not it's not bad enough
*  Are you enough? Look at me say you're enough
*  You make me
*  Say you're a lot
*  You're a lot the whole podcast because well now I know I'm a lot yeah
*  You know until I said no idea Jesus I thought I was kind of easygoing and chill, but I am totally not and I'm alive
*  I am chill. I'm really fun
*  And I let my boyfriend bang other people but like or I would be into discussing that happening, but
*  Yeah, I'm a lot and that's okay. It's okay. Yeah, you're fun. Yeah, you're hilarious. I can be really fun
*  I think that's also it has to be a part of why you're such a good comic
*  It has to be those things have to be connected yes
*  I know all that madness is comes out in the creativity and it comes out your writing and it comes out your performance
*  So yeah, that's part of why it's so good. Thanks, man
*  But you have to know that right? I did it does what we do is crazy. Yeah, there's no way around it
*  We're all crazy. It just put every my crazy is different than Doug Stanhope's crazy
*  Which is different than you just keep going down the line
*  Everybody's got their own Ali Wong's got her own crazy. Everyone's got their own crazy. Yeah insecurity. Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, I but for you when it comes together. It makes great comedy. Yeah, I'm intense. Yes, and it does
*  I'm really intense. I am
*  And I can I'm already like going over things. I've said here and I'm like, I am never gonna find a fucking husband
*  You know true. I will 100%
*  Thanks, man, yeah, no doubt yes
*  Now listening to this and I'm like I need to find her
*  Thank you, yeah
*  I'll be I'll be the person I end up with will take me as I am
*  I'm not I can't I can't change for anyone anymore. I've been doing that too much
*  But yeah, will I get the tonight show after this interview? But that's good. You don't want it
*  Fuck would you want to do with that thing? I mean, I would like to host a late-night talk show someday
*  Well, they will be doing it on the internet. Mm-hmm. No one should ever try to censor you no way
*  Right makes you fun and interesting and special is you all of yeah all of you that you showed here
*  Not some weird procter and gamble version of you that's gonna sell tampons on some late-night bullshit show
*  The fuck out of here with that that would be a waste of you if you want to do the Ellen DeGeneres show
*  It'll be a fucking waste of you, right?
*  If they get rid of Ellen cuz she's so mean and they bring in Nikki Glaser and you have to pretend you give a fuck
*  About dancing for all these people. I like dancing. I bet you do
*  Talk about getting gagged and I know but I can
*  Because I've admitted this these things but but that is what you should talk about
*  I know but I could be more than those things
*  I could save that for here. No, you are all those things. You can do other things here as well
*  Right. I mean here as in the internet. Yes. Yes, you can do other things that you could talk about
*  Everything you want to talk about not just little segments
*  You have to save parts of it the the the parts that are disturbing for some people
*  Save that for the people to get it or my patreon
*  I'm gonna say that
*  That world is fucked that that world of like censored
*  Like you don't know who the one of the reasons why the Ellen thing is so fascinating to people people find out that she's mean
*  They're like like, you know
*  That's not all she thinks about and talks about when she's doing that show, right?
*  Like if we found out that Jimmy Fallon was secretly doing heroin and fucking guys you'd be like I knew it
*  I knew you couldn't be that that same guy all the time. It's just too
*  Too that's what he's not. Why do why why is that the way it is that I don't think why do people I don't think?
*  They do then why aren't advertisers investing in people who are being honest in in but they are they now they are podcasts
*  Yeah, I have a lot of ads. No, I know you do but this is leading the charge people but this is this is
*  This is mainstream now. Mm-hmm, like the world of television
*  Like the censored view of things it's not viable anymore because it's not real humans
*  So that's why the ratings are terrible
*  The ratings are terrible because it's not compelling because you only scratch the surface of human potential of a human
*  Personality of human interest you only just you dabble in this very shallow pool and you don't we're swimming
*  Look at us in here swimming. Stand up. Yes. It's ankle high. You're not swimming
*  You're lying on your stomach in a fucking kiddie pool where other people are jumping into the ocean of ideas and that's the difference
*  But don't we rest getting in so much trouble with who I?
*  Mean yeah some ads look I'm sure I know for a fact
*  I've said things on this podcast where I've lost sponsors, but then more of them come in they take their place
*  Yeah, but you're not a bad person. You're a good person
*  That's what I keep going back to because sometimes I feel like a bad person
*  Not about the things I talked about you know, you're not no there's nothing about you. That's a bad person
*  You're just honest about the way your brain works and everybody's brain works differently. We're all weird
*  We're all weird and different, but you don't know who's weird
*  That's why the Ellen thing is so interesting to people because like oh, she's mean she's secretly mean
*  So she should be tends to be nice, but she's mean you know like if somebody
*  Just pretends to be this version of someone that we see in a Mary Poppins movie
*  Or we see in some sort of a Disney television show like that's what freaks people out like like
*  Why is that person that like I think mr.. Rogers was really like that? I do too
*  I think we were getting that's he was honest. Yes, that was his art really was him, but that's so rare
*  But if you found that mr.. Rogers is a secret cunt
*  You like to spit on people at red lights, you know like you'd be like what mr.. Rogers
*  That's why people are freaking out about Ellen because it was just the opposite of what we thought. It's a scam
*  Yeah, people feel deceived
*  It's also a tyranny of being like the one person who's in charge of this whole empire and all these people hundreds of people work
*  Around really Helen can I get your tea Ellen? Would you like crackers? Ellen? Would you like this? Yeah? Shut up? Get away get away from me
*  Yeah
*  I'll have to say for people who don't know Joe Rogan off the show is
*  You're like
*  Exactly that I was trying to try to make a joke, but I'm like there is no joke to be made here exactly the same
*  I don't think I could be I don't think I could fake it that long
*  Right like I've done fifteen hundred and whatever the fuck are these things and look I've displayed bad behavior
*  I've displayed anger and stupidity. I've said stupid shit
*  Greta
*  Really
*  It's the thinking about being mean to people that's what that's a people or like talking about people
*  I know that's that's what I freak out about too. Well that's comes well there we go
*  People who are actually mean don't worry about hurting people's feelings
*  They just say it and they don't go back and go oh, no, what did I say?
*  That's the mark of actually being a good person
*  You say honest things that actually hurt people and then you get hot I get high and I go
*  I said it that way, but I really did mean at the time, but I don't want to hurt that person
*  Yeah, I just want to kill him take that out and do you apologize to you? I have apologized before
*  Yeah, I've done all those things
*  Look when you're doing what we're doing and we know this is where are three hours in now, right?
*  It's 338 right now crazy time flies
*  When we're doing what we're doing we're we have no script. I mean we only shared a couple of text messages
*  I didn't even talk to you on the phone. There's no guest prep
*  I'm not I'm not getting interviewed before here and what do you want to talk about and you have a list of things
*  Yeah, we go wild. I know anything can happen. I was like trying to prepare for this
*  Like what am I gonna talk to do about it drop that yeah, there's no agenda
*  Well, if we did that there's no way you would have been so wild the way you know exactly so
*  You're gonna this is a it's a fucking you're thinking
*  I do Joe. Okay before we can I really came here?
*  I needed I need advice from you in like a real way and you just like okay
*  What you just said to me really meant a lot by the way, I needed to hear a I'm not a bad person for the things
