# Joe Rogan Experience #1376 - Artie Lange
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 04, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjMGOaDPav8)
*  Network
*  The timer's on all right, we're rolling
*  First of all before we get started. I want to say thank you to Luis J
*  Gomez for hooking this up. We shout out to the Legion of skanks without them. We would be nothing. Yes
*  What's up Joe Rogan brother
*  Hey, I'm alive. You're a lot look man. I've been following this whole everybody's been following you
*  Yeah, but that's first of all, thanks for being so nice. You're very supportive Joe
*  I mean that means a lot to me. I'm happy to see you healthy. Yeah, you look good. Your face looks good. Yeah thin
*  You look healthy. You look like you're you're vibrant. Yeah. No, I'm present
*  I talked to this hell and David Tell came to visit me in rehab and he said
*  You're present. You don't want to leave every five seconds. Yeah, which is what cocaine does to you, right? You know, so
*  No, I feel good. I feel good. I mean it's I got nine months clean. That's amazing. Yeah, that's amazing
*  Two days ago was nine months. What's the hump?
*  Like what do they say you have to get over before you can stay clean? Well, first of all
*  My drug history is insane. It's it started when the first time I got high and I tell these young kids cuz you know
*  I'm 52 now. So I was in you know, I was in rehab and jail
*  and a halfway house the last eight months and
*  with some of the craziest motherfuckers you've ever met in your life and
*  They all have stories but once they know my story because I had some success in life
*  Basically as a full-blown junkie, they're fascinated by it. Right and
*  The first time I got high was 1979. Okay, Jimmy Jimmy Carter was president
*  So when you tell a 22 year old kid that they're like blown away that I'm even alive and I am too
*  I was I hit a home run in Little League. I'll never forget this and I
*  I
*  My buddy's older brother we used to call this kid sick Jack
*  I don't know what happened to him, but he he had to me a joint and I took a puff of the weed and from
*  Eleven years old I knew I
*  Loved it so much. I just loved being I loved the feeling of being out of control
*  You talk to a normal person they go I hate being out of control. I loved it
*  I love like Wow and you have an excuse for it. I was fucked up. Yeah, that's the thing
*  Yeah, and excuse for being wild an excuse for just being a screw-up till you know
*  and my old man was a lunatic he was not a drug addict or an alcoholic, but he was a
*  Criminal, you know, he was a low-level criminal
*  he came to the streets of Newark and got to like the 10th grade in high school and
*  He was like my favorite human being of all time. He was like my older brother, but I saw him do a lot of bad shit
*  You
*  Know I saw him fight all the time
*  He was a boxer when he was young and just a real street smart guy and his life was chaos and
*  I loved the chaos. I was addicted to risk. That's why I'm a gambler too. So
*  When cocaine came into my life a few years later
*  I was 16 the first time I did a line of blow and that was really fun because now you're up all the time and and
*  That started basically a 35 year drug run that didn't end to like nine months ago
*  I mean, I don't know if it's ended, you know, that's the thing. I don't put pressure on myself
*  I'm like it's one that one day at a time stuff. It sounds so cliche
*  But I take it one minute at a time I can't guarantee people I'm never gonna get high again
*  I just know I'm not gonna get high in the next 10 minutes and I don't want to get high again
*  There's there is your risk of saying that you don't know if you're ever gonna get high again
*  Like you know, well the direct opposite is true. That's what they tell you in a program like narcotics anonymous
*  And again, I'm not some big program guy and I didn't turn to some god guy anything like that
*  But I'm a little more spiritual I would say and you know, it's all stuff, you know
*  You should tell me the last time I was on the show, you know, you're telling me to try to live, right?
*  Like you know exercise anything anything to get you through today. That's positive, you know, I
*  I
*  In other words by by saying you'll never get high again and I used to do that all the time
*  When you're really bullshitting yourself and everybody else you put a lot of pressure on yourself
*  You know like I like to say even these young kids these poor kids man are looking at a lot of jail time
*  Prison time they're living under a fucking bridge some of these kids and they got nothing
*  That's why you know the careers of me and you have a congratulations on your everything you've done
*  Joe man, you're just you're a solid guy a great talent, but um, you know
*  The careers we have are such blessings. I mean we're living out a dream
*  you know and these kids have nothing and for a 23 year old kid to say in a in a
*  Group therapy session anywhere. I'm never gonna get high again
*  It's daunting to say you're never gonna do anything again. And even for me at 52 years old. I love it
*  You got to say I love I love being high. I love the chaos
*  I love the the lifestyle you get addicted to the lifestyle too because you live like you don't live like everybody else
*  you know and I had a means of making money legally and
*  You know these kids had a Rob to get all the shit and and so that was enabling too
*  We live in an enabling world
*  But to say you're never gonna get high again is so much pressure to say I don't know and
*  Just work on the next day and for me, it's like I take it minute by minute literally
*  I got high like we're here on the Lower East Side of Manhattan right now
*  I got high everywhere here back in the 80s. I used to come here with my my buddy's older brother and
*  Get mescaline hits
*  Loots back in the day, you know weed in Washington Square Park
*  Blow so there's triggers all over the place
*  So I just say if I can get this one more just get one more block without fucking up that turns into a
*  Day and then time you know so it's it's harder to say for yourself. I I
*  I'll never get high again. What was the longest you went before this nine-month stretch?
*  It feels like the last time I had nine months clean. I was nine months old
*  No, I
*  I'm an okay in the in the late 90s. I came out of LA County Jail
*  Well again the first time I got arrested for I got arrested for attempted bank robbery when I was 17 years old
*  I wrote a bank
*  Tell her a joke note that said I have a gun and I went to jail and I got a probation. I
*  Asked us tell it for fifty thousand dollars. Whoa, and and
*  She started to give me the money and she put she she hit the sound alarm
*  I was with my girlfriend at the time. I was 17. She was 18. So a SWAT team showed up to her house
*  We just left and we had the money. I didn't take the money
*  She started to give me the money but again, this is my fucked up personality flaw
*  I I was like, wow, I'm gonna get 50 G's, you know, and she started to give it to me
*  But then something said I can't do this. I took the note. I gave her and I crumpled it up
*  I said, I'm just kidding and I threw it in a garbage can I get in my girlfriend's car and she drives away
*  She goes what happened there? I didn't even tell her I go out and that's not it's bullshit
*  They had her name because she had an account. She's an adult. Oh, geez and a SWAT team shows up at her house
*  So we both get arrested we're handcuffed and I go to jail she I say and her old man I think was connected
*  it was like a mob guy and
*  He sat me down and he goes when you rob a bank, you know, take my daughter
*  He didn't have a problem robbing the bank
*  He had a problem that I took his daughter
*  Don't take women when you rob a bank and I go I wasn't trying to rob a bank goes
*  No, he goes I know you you're a craze your craze and he was
*  But but again, I just loved the the the action yeah, that's why I love gambling so um,
*  I go out to LA I get mad TV now making 10 grand a week and I got a bad cocaine problem and
*  I started gambling the first Tyson Holyfield fight. I lost
*  $25,000 I thought Tyson was gonna fucking kill him and Quincy Jones who produced mad TV got us
*  Ringside seats at the at the at the fight and I lose
*  25 grand on a fight another eight grand at the tables
*  I get blow I take it on a plane back to LA at one o'clock in the morning
*  I take a swing at a cop and I go to LA County jail
*  For trying to assault the cop
*  And he found an eight ball. Okay, so I had an eight ball of coke on me
*  I take a swing at a cop and that's my last day at mad tv. Oh, Jesus. What year was this?
*  This is 1996 right after we did that sketch at mad tv, which is like 95 I think that was 96
*  It was 96. It was the second season. Okay, uh, which is funny to watch because it's so fucking long ago
*  Um kids about about a month after that. We did we taped that sketch. I got arrested. Wow, uh, and uh,
*  So I go to LA county. I come out of LA county. I'm on probation and I gotta take urine tests and everything so I got clean
*  So to answer your question, I had almost a year
*  Clean at that point and then after that it was off to the races again
*  so nine months is the second longest i've had clean since i'm
*  11 years old now, what are you doing for thrills? Like do you have to replace the joe rogan podcast?
*  Do you have to do something to replace well the feeling of gambling or because you're not gambling, right?
*  That's an excellent question. No, I can't I can't do anything because it escalates right? That's all right
*  It escalates if I put a five dollar bet on a roulette table right now by tomorrow morning, I'd be running guns to cuba
*  I i'd have a human trafficking ring
*  Everything the badness just gets worse and worse because I can't have a beer, you know, right, right?
*  And that's hard to that's hard to admit to yourself, too
*  You know, I mean I can't have one beer and it took me a long time to grab that concept
*  Some people can't so uh, you had moments where you could have one beer in your life
*  Like have you ever gone when I grab a slice of pizza have a couple beers and that's it
*  Yeah watching a game, but the problem is I mix vices
*  I I tell us when I was a longshoreman at the port in north. Okay, uh for a couple of years
*  I was the orange juice beer this happened twice. I had a bookie. I used to gamble with
*  So drinking and coke and gambling does not mix well. That's why I give you free drinks at the casino because you're you know messed up. Yeah
*  So i'm from monday night football
*  The bookie took bets up till eight o'clock kickoff was nine o'clock
*  So at 5 30 right after I got out of work, I would call the book and I would say
*  Give me give me a thousand dollars on the giants play the cowboys. Give me a thousand on the giants
*  Then I start drinking
*  7 30 comes around I forget I made the bet two separate times. I bet on the other team
*  At 7 30 I called the book and I said give me the cowboys so all I could do is lose the vig
*  Oh, jeez loose so this happened twice. So the bookie
*  bookies
*  Tape all your calls and they destroy the tape at the end before because the cops get it
*  But what they do is they have the calls on tape in case you have a like you have a dispute
*  Like I'd have bet that he goes. Oh, I got you on tape doing it
*  So I said to the bookie. Why did you let me do that? He goes because you got to learn a life lesson
*  I go. Thanks. Mr. Bookie for giving me a life lesson, you know, i'm trying to win money
*  And he goes I got a tape of you at 5 30
*  Making a bet so at 5 30 i'm like all articulate. I go yeah, give me the giants laying seven
*  Over the cowboys. Give me the under over 41. Give me a dime, which is a thousand dollars. He goes here's you at 7 30
*  Give me the fucking cowboys
*  I want the cowboys in the under parlaying and you hear him try to go you just bet the giants fuck you
*  No, I didn't
*  I put some chick on the phone
*  Give him the cowboys. I'm a cowboy. I met some girl who was a cowboy fan took me in a you know
*  So he's a bookie's trying to give me life coaching to oh my god
*  So so what happens is if I would go have the one beer on a tuesday night in february at a sports bar
*  Then I realized virginia tech is playing
*  In a college basketball game. I bet virginia tech then I have two beers then I got coke then it's over so
*  Your question is a great question. What do I do for thrills? What are you replacing it with?
*  That's that's where this business which is taking me back now, I think 11 times. This is my 11th comeback
*  Um, I have fans that I got that, you know through maya tv and the stern show, of course that are so loyal
*  Stand up stand up this this business doing what we're doing right now talking to another funny guy who I love
*  uh bullshitting
*  Making money doing comedy. I have a gig tonight in poughkeepsie. I'm going to poughkeepsie
*  You know and i'm gonna get on stage
*  And talk to people for an hour and make a lot of money doing it. Are you doing bananas?
*  Uh, no, i'm doing a place called laugh it up
*  Laugh it up in poughkeepsie. Uh, so um, uh, yeah, I did the bananas thing a bunch of times but so so, you know
*  That that's that's that's what i'm grabbing onto right now because women i've lost three
*  I say this all the time. I lost three fiancés because of heroin heroin saved me a lot of money
*  I dodged three torpedoes with that the heroin was way less expensive than a divorce
*  Uh, so you know right now I cling to my work comedy is the only thing that hasn't abandoned me
*  Yes, you know in a lot of ways and you know, there's businesses
*  You know that keeps taking me back, you know, a lot of people are addicts
*  They get really addicted like marathon running right? Have you ever thought of doing something like that?
*  Uh, okay, I'm telling you it seems like a crazy idea, but you if you could think you could run a block
*  Then you run two. Yeah, next thing you know, you run a mile. Yeah, next thing you know, you're i'm gonna do a 5k
*  Well, I do I do a bit about this in my stand up back. The first time I tried to get off heroin
*  this this um
*  This trainer who I hired this kid he said
*  You know, uh, I guarantee you a heroin high is not as good as a running high and I said to him
*  Have you ever tried heroin?
*  And he goes to do something to say he goes he goes no I go well then you're not qualified to be in this fucking conversation
*  Because i've done heroin and on occasion i've run and it's not even close
*  Yeah, the only way you get a running high you got to be in really good shape and you also got to run more than 20 feet
*  Yeah, you'll run a lot. Yeah. I mean, I mean do you run is that what you yeah?
*  Yeah, I mean I would love to get that kind of thing in my life again. I'm way healthier
*  than I uh ever was in a long time. Where are you living?
*  I live in Hoboken, New Jersey. Yeah, there's gotta be a place near there. Yeah. No, there's nothing
*  That's the thing about nowadays young comics like
*  Forget about the drug culture if a 25 year old comedian has some gluten he starts to freak out
*  Like they go to they go to alcoholics anonymous. They have gluten my mistake
*  So there's nothing but healthy shit going on in hoboken. It's nothing but young people
*  jogging
*  Pilates yoga, you know get in it
*  I'd love to
*  I mean, you know
*  It's something to get addicted to yes you can get addicted i'm for sure addicted to exercise
*  I know that i've known that about you for a long time, but it can help you. Yeah. Yeah
*  well
*  That that getting something like that in my life would be
*  The ultimate turnaround. Yes, yeah, because I love sports. I'm a good athlete
*  I was an all-state baseball player and I uh, I could shoot hoops. I was playing a lot of basketball in jail
*  Were you yeah, I was running full courts man. I got an outside shot like crazy
*  And uh, but i'm the kind of guy I have here. I coordination I could gain weight playing basketball. I don't even move
*  I just shoot the ball, right?
*  The running thing is something I you know, I got to release an endorphins. Yes what you just said see
*  That's a very insightful question because the whole
*  The whole thing is substituting die. Yeah with something else finding something else you're obsessed with. Yeah
*  My life i've always been obsessed with things but luckily none of them have been bad, right?
*  You know, it's just been but it's the same personality the same personality that could have led me to be a junkie
*  Let me to just get obsessed with martial arts or comedy or I wish I got addicted to martial arts and heroin
*  Yeah, I mean I I struggle with video games
*  Pool like any anything that's uh, like that I could get better at i'm obsessed with you know, it's funny. I uh,
*  everything in my life
*  Went back to drugs, you know, I love shooting pool too. Yeah. Yeah, you're good
*  Yeah, we played when we were at my studio. Yeah, I I found though when I did cocaine
*  I was better at pool because I focus
*  A lot of guys take amphetamines
*  Yeah, and and you have this hand eye coordination gets better. So you're playing nine ball or something
*  I actually wrote a I have a movie script
*  I'm trying to write called booger sugar nine ball where a guy gets way better
*  He becomes the best nine ball player on cocaine
*  So he has to keep getting money playing pool to school the best guys from back in the day
*  They were all taking amphetamines like buddy hall and all these like world champions. Yeah, they were all they were all drug addicts
*  They were playing days and days at a time. Yeah, well the movie the hustler with the with gays
*  They play for and I think that was booze. That was just booze, but these guys really did do that
*  I mean these guys played for they got on pills and they played for days. The key is what you said obsession
*  Yes obsession. I get obsessed over a woman. I'm dating. Yes, I get obsessed over
*  You know if anything I like yeah, I don't want to stop I want to keep rewarding myself the situation
*  You know, you're you're you're a very successful guy
*  So is someone going to be able to tell you I was making all this money
*  And I'm taking care of people around me supporting people around me. And so who's going to tell me to stop right?
*  You know, that is always a problem. That's a problem. Yes, man people. It's a real problem
*  Yeah, like I'm I make millions of dollars a year. Yeah, fuck you. Something's going right. Yeah, I'm not going to stop
*  Then what happened is I got I got legal consequences like I've never had before
*  so your situation now like
*  You can't if you test positive at all for anything
*  You're fucked I could go to jail like even if like I smoked a joint in this room with you
*  If if it came up, I mean that's that's you know, everybody again. I'm on this thing called drug court, which is like probation on steroids
*  Uh, it's kind of new. It's only 20 years old. The premise of it is
*  There's not a lot of guys with my charges I right now I have a third degree possession charge right now and um
*  because the the uh
*  The charge in la is so long ago that was expunged off my record. So technically I got a first time offense third degree
*  Not a lot a lot of guys with that little of a charge get drug court drug court is for people who can't stop robbing people
*  Because in other words they were putting everybody in jail for robbing stuff and they linked that behavior back to drug use
*  They were stealing that support their drug habit. So they get all these robberies on their jacket and and they go okay
*  To try to help you instead of giving you prison when you give you this thing called drug court
*  But you got a report like like I gave five urines this week
*  You know, so if I if I got high first of all my situation because i'm well known
*  The second I I give clean urine clean urine clean urine and then 130 it's all over, you know, yeah the news now are they
*  Why do they give you such a harsh sentence if it's just possession? I I I don't really know
*  Are they trying to make an exam? I I think that's part of it. Yeah, because you know
*  Every time when I got the first charge was just regular probation
*  And I got no new charges or anything. It was all these technical violations because I kept pissing dirty
*  Uh, and eventually after I failed that they gave me drug court, but you know again
*  I got no problem with the people in the legal system. What is what is your feeling? I'm like what works?
*  How do you get someone for you? Is it being scared? Is it that's crashing?
*  But you got you gotta want to do it, right?
*  And you want to do it right now?
*  But was it because they threatened you with so much?
*  I mean is there what i'm trying to get at is is there like a method to this that makes any sense?
*  They're supposed to be but the okay the the premise I think the best thing about jail for a drug addict is
*  It actually locks you away for the drugs for a little while because
*  You see now cocaine made my life chaos for a long time
*  But when heroin came into the game forget it
*  Lights out heroin is if I saw some kid thinking about trying heroin for the first time
*  I would tackle them
*  I would do anything to get them to stop because the only way to stop this this opioid crisis is prevention
*  You know doctors became pushers with oxys and stuff like that, you know
*  Drug companies, it's a lot of money, you know, yeah on the legal and illegal side of it
*  so
*  Once once heroin gets in your system
*  You need it every eight hours
*  You need it every eight hours like it's oxygen. So you you become desperate withdrawals are insane
*  So is it insane like what is it like it's insanity well, okay
*  When I became
*  You know again my story on a howard stern show the big headline at the end of why I left that show was
*  And I I speak sometimes in NA meetings and I try to get this through young people's heads
*  Uh
*  I was basically a full-blown junkie on the biggest radio show of all time
*  Yeah, I mean that's that's the headline that's that's what you know, so nodding off on the air
*  But I also had a full-time stand-up comedy schedule
*  So my life became the kind of chaos that not many human beings have ever seen
*  So I would I would have gigs in pittsburgh phoenix in detroit three weeks in a row
*  Then I got to get back at 6 a.m. To be on stern
*  Now I was by the end I was so paranoid to bring drugs on a plane
*  But I needed the heroin to get on stage because the sickness picture the flu times 10
*  That's what the that's what withdrawals are
*  And there's there's aches all the emotional pain you're masking comes back. So it's withdrawals are a living hell
*  So when you see the withdrawals coming you see the heroin getting out of your system, you're like, okay
*  It's going to get really bad
*  Then you realize
*  Most people can't leave the room
*  Then you realize you got to do five radio shows a week and then you got to fly to detroit and do stand-up on a saturday night
*  So when I landed in detroit, I wouldn't have heroin so my life became a dance of like I would land in every city and I would say
*  Uh, I would I would get in a cab and I'd say to the cab driver. I need I need heroin. I got a score
*  Otherwise, I can't do this show. Sometimes a guy would recognize me and and want tickets to the show
*  I would go to the worst part of detroit. Okay, not or the worst part of anywhere anywhere any city
*  And try to find heroin because in an hour I got to be on stage and in 20 minutes
*  I'm going to be deathly sick when I say sick like shit in my pants throwing up
*  So this is you're getting there with no connections. No connections
*  Now I started you ever not score. Uh, yeah, I used to call them. I used to call them
*  Dope sick sets because withdrawals they call it dope sickness and I one time I was on stage in orlando, florida
*  I had to do an hour half an hour into my set. I realized i'm gonna shit my pants
*  In front of 2 000 people
*  So I said, okay in my head and like, you know with your act
*  Sometimes you got jokes you could do like a robot
*  So i'm just i'm just going through the motions and you say this it'll get a laugh you say this it'll get a laugh
*  I realized i'm gonna shit my pants
*  Okay in front of 2 000 people so I said there's two choices. I can either say guys
*  I gotta go to the bathroom
*  Listen to some music
*  And go shit or shit my pants in front of 2 000 people. Did you shit your pants? No, I I I
*  I said play a song and I ran the back. Did you tell them are you gonna shit your pants?
*  I came back and I said I I was gonna shit my pants
*  So okay, these are stern fans. They go it would have been funnier if you shit your pants, of course
*  So now I got stern fans who know it's about to shit my pants the last half hour of the show is like them
*  Yelling shit your pants. Yeah, they're a particularly ruthless band
*  I remember I saw you at the lex the luxor in vegas
*  Yeah, it was one of the first times I ever saw you in front of a stern fan
*  Right like the stern fan group, right? They're they're ruthless. It's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy
*  And then they say they love you, but then they're screaming shit out
*  and uh
*  You know in vegas is another again
*  So so that became my life the chaos was insane
*  What do you think was encouraged to like did people encourage like did they enjoy the fact that you were off the rails?
*  Some people did yeah some people did and because of that
*  Do you think that like you identified with that? Like this is who I am. This is what I do
*  That's a great question
*  Absolutely part of me said maybe this is my thing
*  Yeah, you know and that's that's you bullshitting yourself because that's also you saying it's a reason to continue. Yes
*  You know, I could keep fucking up because this is how I make money
*  Yes, and this is my a lot of money a lot of money. Yeah, I mean I okay
*  The the most money I ever did making stand up stand the most money I made it was actually at mandalay bay
*  Superbowl eve 2007 this is an example of my life in one night. I made 140 grand doing stand
*  Okay, I got 70 grand for two shows. I did two shows
*  I'm on the plane flying back from vegas. I'm doing the math between the gambling the drugs and the hookers. I lost 145 000
*  Okay, so
*  So when I got home my accountant thought I was gonna give him a check for 140 grand. I said I need five g's
*  Oh, Jesus christ. I made
*  140 000 in a night one night my father climbed roofs for a living. Okay
*  He never made that in 30 years and and then i'm going back to co-host the biggest radio show ever and
*  I lost 100 but I had a ten thousand dollar hooker who looked like a young carmen elector and uh
*  and uh, uh, I I lost money playing craps I lost on the game
*  And uh and the drugs I bought Jesus. I was down 145 000
*  So after I paid out my commission to the to the agents the weekend cost me like 40 grand
*  Have you put this in a book?
*  Yeah, I don't know if that story's in a book i'm right I wrote another book in jail too
*  I wrote a fourth book good. Uh, it's called ripping and running and i'm trying to get a deal
*  I'm trying to get a deal for it right now. Fuck wouldn't give you a deal for that
*  Jesus christ, that's just one fucking story of of i'm sure
*  Yeah of madness. Yeah, that's the thing about those stories is they're so great like it's such a catch 22, right?
*  It's like the stories are so amazing and and people love you for those stories, but they also want you to be clean
*  Well, here's the thing. So so that's the catch 22, you know, and then i'm saying to myself
*  So so so again the answer to your original question is a is the if I want to be honest with you right now
*  The reason the thing that got me the method i'm using now are consequences
*  If I didn't have jail hanging over my head, I don't know what would happen today, but
*  I think i'm far enough out of getting high like I got it's the drugs are finally out of my fucking system
*  There's other drugs they give you
*  That are basically legal dope. There's this thing called suboxone, which is an opiate blocker, but it's dope
*  You know, what does it do to you? It it stops you from getting high on heroin, but it stops the withdrawals too
*  So you also get high, you know, it's an opioid
*  Yeah, but it's legal
*  So if you're on what they call suboxone maintenance
*  you uh
*  You can pee with that in your urine and you'll be all right if they know you're on it
*  But you're getting high through a doctor you're getting high. It's like methadone, right?
*  Methadone we used to have these guys that would come to the pool hall. We'd call them the methadoneans
*  Yeah, they would go down the street. They'd get their methadone. They'd come to the pool hall and they'd just be zombies
*  Okay
*  Another story about methadone for a little while I took methadone at a methadone clinic while I was on howard
*  Because I was desperately trying to get off heroin
*  But look again the only difference between methadone and heroin is legality like like once the courts are cool with one for some reason
*  And the other one's illegal. I mean if if you have no
*  Legal issues, why not just keep doing heroin? It makes no fucking sense probably better for you
*  Heroin is the one drug that doesn't affect any organ like the way people die on heroin is you
*  You overdose but like look at keith richards. I mean he just got good shit
*  He got pure shit and he never odied and died
*  Uh, so like he's almost preserved. It kind of doesn't affect your liver nothing like that
*  So there's no real health consequences other than overdose other than really other than od and the withdrawals because it becomes a part of your body
*  like
*  It's it's again. I'm not recommending it. It's a living hell
*  It's a living hell the lifestyle and the people that get into your life because of it
*  but so
*  A couple of times I went to a methadone clinic that opened at 6 a.m
*  Because the guy was a fan of stern he would let me come into the methadone clinic at 5 30 again
*  I took a a shit. They give it to you an orange juice. Okay, take a shot of orange juice with the methadone
*  Twice I threw up on the air and one time
*  Again, I was never funnier off the shit than this
*  Howard was talking I think it was rosanne bar and howard said hey you look thin she was on the phone
*  and i'm nauseous like
*  Okay, so listen to this timing i'm nauseous from the methadone
*  I feel like i'm gonna throw up and I got a live mic, you know, right and uh, and she goes
*  Yeah, howard i've been exercising and uh, he goes what are you been doing?
*  She goes well I get in I get in a uh, a two-piece bathing suit now as soon as she said that you hear me go
*  As soon as well and howard thought I was doing it to be funny go shit, what are you doing? I go
*  As soon as she said I get a two-piece
*  My comedic timing was better
*  So so so now i'm doing that for a while and i'm at but at that point I know legal
*  What the fuck i'm even trying this for right, you know, and suboxone look suboxone helped save me and helped me get off it
*  But eventually you got to get off that too and you kick how hard is that? Is it hard to get off it?
*  Okay, there's something called fentanyl out. Yeah, okay, which is elephant tranquilizer. It's synthetic
*  It's like spice like synthetic weed
*  All these kids in jail, by the way, these young kids they smoke this k2 shit
*  They and they they stop while they're talking to you like a kid will be talking to you in jail like that jail jumpsuit
*  And he'll just be like he stops. It looks like he got hit with volcanic ash or something
*  Because they spray these chemicals on the weed and it does something to them. They start dancing like julie andrews
*  All these bloods and crypts are dancing to the sound of music
*  I
*  The hills are alive
*  It's really it's weird so fentanyl is like the heroin version of that it's synthetic heroin
*  Yeah, uh much stronger people are dying from touching it
*  Like they touch it it gets in cops are dying or cops are getting overdosed from these guys
*  At the border that are sweating right it comes from china
*  There's always conspiracy theories about china trying to kill us and who knows it's weeding out a lot of junkies
*  I was in a rehab which I got to give a shout out to this place turning point
*  In paterson is where I really got clean. I was there for three months
*  I did a month in jail and then I did three months of turning point a great place
*  They really helped me out a lot my counselor sarah shout out to her
*  but she uh, you know, I got clean there, but it was in paterson in the hood and
*  The gangs would fight each other to get the corner right across from the the rehab. Oh, jeez because people come out
*  Yeah, people come out and they get high two kids. I was in there with you know, went and got they died that day
*  Jesus they just leave and they died that day from fentanyl. These are junkies. If you get a certain amount of time clean
*  Your your willpower, you know your your resistance resistance goes down and uh,
*  So they would take what they used to take and then they were out there so
*  To get off the suboxone is is very difficult because you got to kick it. You got to kick it, you know withdrawals take
*  Average four to five days and i've done that in jail twice. So if you have fentanyl in your system
*  And you take us a box
*  you go into what they call precip withdrawals, which are like
*  The regular withdrawals times a million like you feel like you're going to die you start to hallucinate this happened to me twice
*  I went to I went to jail
*  Uh, not knowing that the coke they put it in everything they put it in the cocaine
*  They put it in the marijuana because they want people to catch a habit
*  And if a couple people die because if you got a habit now, you got to keep going back
*  So you're buying what you think is blow. It's not it's it's blow with this fentanyl in it
*  Heroin is brown when you get it. It's brown when you get it
*  Fentanyl is white. So if it's really a lighter color
*  It's it's got fentanyl in it, but people want to get high so bad
*  They take the risk if you're a junkie, you'll take that risk
*  So I did not know I had fentanyl in my system it was in the cocaine I had so I get to I get to jail
*  And I see this kid in the bullpen at the jail
*  And he was a dealer I knew from the street and he owed me he owed me a favor and
*  These kids smuggle drugs in in there in the band that I rug sweatpants
*  They have it right here
*  And if you see a kid going like this all the time and kids walking over to him, you know
*  He's got something so I went over to the kid and I said, what do you got?
*  And he goes I just got subs suboxone I said give me one because I you know, I couldn't deal with the anxiety and
*  He gave it to me. I didn't know I had fentanyl in my system
*  I took a suboxone with it and in 10 minutes. I was writhing on the floor
*  Right just just just so they threw me in a cell and I had a I had a kick
*  I had a kick with those kind of withdrawals and on a jail cell. How long does it last five days?
*  Five days now the co's when I was kicking at SS County Jail the co's there are I love them
*  They're great guys are tough motherfuckers. They got a tough job and they they were very supportive of me
*  And they protected me in there. They were they were good guys
*  but um
*  So they were giving me food. They were trying to keep me hydrated and shit. There was a doctor there
*  It was really cool. But I I was naked
*  Because you're also on a suicide watch if people kick from heroin again all this emotional pain comes back on you
*  And a lot of people commit suicide
*  So they give you what they call this turtle shell they that you're naked and you go on this turtle thing
*  That's like a velcro thing
*  So I kicked for five days in that thing just just rolling around the floor. I started to hallucinate
*  My old man's been dead for 30 years. I kind of swore. He was talking to me right in front of me
*  Yeah
*  It's just and then and then knowing that then I get it out of my system
*  I get out of jail and i'm and I and I get high an hour later
*  You know
*  so
*  you know
*  If if you keep doing that there's something wrong. So what happened this time that changed?
*  I I they they kept me away for longer than I ever was
*  I was doing I was doing like two-week bid a week bid in jail
*  This time I was in jail for almost two months and I kicked then I went to a long-term
*  rehab and I got locked away from it and
*  Uh, I started to think clearer and think about the consequences and think about my mom
*  And the fact that my mother is this great italian woman
*  uh who uh
*  You know, I thought she just needed money for me
*  I took care my old man on his deathbed said take care of your mother and as an italian guy from north jersey
*  You think that means money doesn't mean anything else
*  So I kept giving her money not knowing she was worried about me dying, you know
*  All the time
*  So she I thought about her pain and I said I can't do this anymore
*  So I just started to think clear and then the one day at a time comes in
*  So that's the difference the difference was I was locked away from the dope
*  longer than I ever was
*  so not only did the physical withdrawals go away, but
*  The mental which was charlie parker the great jazz musician who was a heroin addict died when he was 35
*  He said they can get it out of your body, but they can never get it out of your brain
*  Charlie parker died at 35 charlie parker was 35. Jesus christ the coroner said he was 66
*  Yeah, but but he had the most profound thing I ever heard someone say about heroin
*  He said they can get it out of your brain
*  But they can get it out of your body, but they can't get it out of your brain because you remember it
*  Yeah, you know remember that it's a way to deal with shit and it's a maternal thing, right?
*  It's like almost like being in the womb. Absolutely protected and
*  I've never done it. But when I had knee surgery, they gave me a morphine drip. Oh, yeah, give me a button
*  Yeah, I was in the hospital. I could hit it any time I want. I just hammered that thing
*  Yeah, of course, you just just glide off to the most beautiful wonderful feeling. Well, that's the thing about drugs. They work
*  You know, it's instant it's instant, you know, you don't want and again, that's something else in our business like uh,
*  Uh, I you know, I don't want to wait for anything. I want the money now, right?
*  I want to come now. I want to fucking get high now. I want to I want to gamble now
*  That's the part of what makes you a great comic though that impulsive wildness is what people enjoy in comics
*  Yeah, like all my favorite comics kinesin joey diaz. Yeah, all of them struggled. Yeah, all of them
*  Yeah, it's it's a prior. Look at richard prior. Yeah, lennie bruce lennie bruce. Yeah hicks
*  All of them all of them mitch mitch edward sure robin williams everybody everybody had drug problems
*  Yeah, it um, I give you greg gerardo. I'll give you a great greg gerardo story. All right. Okay, so
*  This to me sums up a comedian who's also a drug addict. All right
*  2006 william shatner roast comedy central, right?
*  Gerardo was just hitting with the roast he was getting to be a big deal
*  But I had party with him a couple of times and you know, we both had the same problem. So uh,
*  So we were the only two guys coming from new york city to do the chat in a roast
*  This was oh six for comedy center. So i'm at the jfk
*  First lounge first first class lounge waiting for my plane and I know greg is supposed to be on the plane
*  He shows up five minutes before the plane takes off and he goes already man. He like hugs me sweating
*  He goes i'm tweaking like he was on taking amphetamines
*  So I go he goes i'm not getting on the plane. I go dude
*  You're like the best guy at these roasts now. You have to get on the plane. This is your career
*  And he goes I can't get on a plane. I go you have to get on the fucking plane
*  So I had all this vikadin I smuggled under my under my sock
*  I said take a couple of vikadin and have a beer so I got him a beer and he started to calm down a bit
*  I literally held his hand. Okay, I held his hand and got him on a plane
*  I changed my seat to sit next to him. He was too paranoid to go to the fucking bathroom
*  So I would guard the bathroom so no one could come in and I we get to la now
*  We got to go to a dress rehearsal at cbs radford
*  Farrah faucet was on that roast. So now he's still freaking out paranoid and he he wants he goes i'm gonna hug farrah faucet
*  I go you can't go near farrah faucet
*  I go not only is your career gonna be over he goes i'm gonna hug farrah i have to kiss her
*  I go she was too easy from us. I go you can't kiss farrah faucet
*  I go great you can't kiss farrah like i'm gonna get arrested
*  I go your career is gonna be over and you're gonna be arrested for sexually assaulting farrah faucet on amphetamines
*  So I go you just gotta calm the fuck down we get through the dress rehearsal
*  And he goes, please don't tell anybody and now i've been there so I know it isn't so I go
*  I want so we go back to the hotel. I I leave my room. I sit by i'm like florence fucking nightingale
*  i'm giving him like hot com presses and shit the morning the next morning the
*  Cars coming to get us to take us to the show at noon
*  And he comes out of it. He comes out of the bathroom. He goes, I I think i'm I came down he hugs me
*  He's crying he goes. Thank you so much. I go dude. You would have done the same thing for me
*  Okay, so now we go to the roast. He's the first roaster up
*  First thing he says he goes arty langs here. How about a hand for arty lang and everybody applauds
*  He looks at me goes look at you arty you fat fucking drug addict
*  That's the first thing he said and I went like this I went bro like this and you want like this
*  That that look that's a comedian yes, that looks a comedian
*  I just saved his fucking life. I'm crying. I practically made out with him
*  I stopped him from sexually assaulting one of the charlie's angles
*  The one yeah, yeah the one fire for he goes up and kiss fire for something
*  I've never said that to another human being
*  Very few people hardly ever have
*  I said the first thing he says is you fat fucking drug addict
*  He had to throw fat in there too
*  And then he gives me a it gives me oh my god, oh my god me one, uh
*  Again, this is something things you wish you had on tape
*  About 1998 ish me mitch edberg and greg giraldo both did sets
*  We all three of us did sets at the comedy zone and there was an old diner on
*  1923 called chelsea square diner. I don't know if it's still there anymore
*  The three of us was me greg and mitch and if you if you ask why god spared me out of that three
*  I have no idea. It's just sheer luck, but god spared me for some reason. I don't know why
*  And I remember talking the three of us were talking about about drugs and headberg
*  He told us to a couple people and I didn't know mitch as well
*  I did a couple of gigs with him
*  But uh, you know, he said you know a lot of people are trying to get me to stop i'm never gonna stop
*  He said i'm just just don't waste your time
*  I i'm never gonna stop doing it. I love it that much
*  and
*  you know
*  at the time
*  I didn't realize how dark that was and he died, you know, he's been dead almost 15 years now
*  You talk about a real genius, you know
*  and um
*  Like he just was like I I just I know I can never stop
*  Like that's how much it takes it takes over to the point where you know
*  You know, you might die out. He goes. I don't care. I want to do it this way
*  Jesus, you know
*  so
*  Again, well, he remember when he almost died from gangrene. Yeah, because he was shooting into the same hole
*  He was going through he might have been with a towel. I don't know
*  And louis black they did a tour together and again, that's one of the sadder stories yet
*  The security at the airport smelled the gangrene
*  Oh boy, that's how they found out. Yeah, and they found shit and I think he beat the case
*  I think they felt like paraphernalia or stuff
*  But you're talking about you know, one of the best maybe the best joke writer ever and he just doesn't he just like I just
*  Again when you live in this life
*  like
*  Stand-ups most of us dreamed of doing this
*  Our whole lives and now you're doing it
*  Who's going to tell you to stop anything?
*  I think with him too, they were inseparable the stand-up and the heroin together. Yeah, like miles dave said like, yeah
*  We're playing the trumpet, you know
*  Again, you're talking about extreme personalities. Yeah, john belushi
*  Yeah, and again like you say you have the same personality, but it just manifested itself in different ways
*  I was lucky when I was a kid. I knew junkies
*  I had my friend jimmy's cousin was selling coke when I was in high school and I watched him rot away
*  I watched him shrivel up and and I remember
*  I I was also I was very paranoid right and I didn't I didn't want to ruin my life
*  I was always worried about ruining my life. Yeah, so i'd see things like that. I'd be like all right
*  Stay the fuck away from drugs. That's an amazing
*  Amazingly mature attitude at that point because I was a direct option. I said that's going to be part of the success
*  Yeah for me was self-preservation. Yeah
*  And look that's a smart way to think but I I tell I tell when I speak I tell these kids because they're like
*  How did you make it man?
*  Like how did you make it in show business like they google me and they see me, you know on the tonight show
*  Yeah, they go. How did you do that? Like in rehab they were like, you know
*  They're watching my movies on youtube. These kids are magicians with the fucking thing
*  And I stand up and they go how did you do this like being a junkie and i'm like, I don't know
*  I can't even remember well, that's part of the problem is that you're kind of rewarded for being so wild and being wild
*  You're you're it's and accentuated. Yes by the drugs
*  And by the craziness and gambling and all of it. Well the way I say the way ray romano wrote new jokes about having kids
*  And a family. Yeah, you know a lot of comics you you comment on your life. Yes, that's how you get new material
*  so my life was not a wife and kids my life was
*  This craziness with drugs and gambling and that's that's where I sort of I mine that
*  For material and it's also the audience loved it
*  They loved the fact that you're out there living that life like buchowski or hunter thompson
*  Anyone who's out there living that life? There's like it's romantic. Yes. Yes
*  You're not living like the average schlub
*  No, ray leotis says it in goodfellas like, you know, we we we were rock stars
*  Yeah, you know all these guys who had to wake up and go to a nine-to-five job
*  We don't know that life, you know
*  Uh, and uh, and I dude I saw the other side when I was at this halfway house
*  um
*  Uh with all these crazy motherfuckers. I had to get a job as part of the program
*  So I pumped gas and I I I worked on the back of a garbage truck for a while throwing garbage
*  And I pumped gas as a kid and you know, you know the money we make for being on stage
*  I'm going for you know from that money. I may I pump gas 40 hours one week. I got a check for 280 dollars
*  You know, so that's what that's life man. Yeah, that's real life. That's real life. Yeah
*  Okay, the story about this kid in the halfway house I had three roommates one was a carjacker
*  The other one was an arsonist. Okay, this other kid was a was a judge. This kid was my bunk mate
*  He lived on the top bunk. I was on the bottom. He's like 22 years old. He had some he had a form of Tourette's
*  Every 11 seconds my hand to god. He made this sound hey
*  Every 11 seconds
*  Hey
*  All night. All right
*  To get to sleep he watched porn on his on his phone
*  So he loved the specific kind of porn and he would keep showing it to me
*  He's jerking off on the top bunk and I gotta go pump gas the next day
*  I'm like my life is fucking over and uh, he he loved watching these really fat black jigs get fucked by small white guys
*  Okay, so this is what you hear all night you hear this fuck me with that honky dick
*  Fuck me you little white pussy
*  Hi
*  Is even in like jails like because he's in the old days people would just let him on fire right and throw him in a dumpster, right?
*  But now it's a disease
*  Right, so he's got a disease
*  So but he the kid I go you're on the fucking internet
*  You can watch the hottest chicks on the planet. He would jerk off these guys. Those chicks look like the 86 celtics
*  That looks like bill walton
*  But then it's like this enormous like oprah looking chick with a little like richard simmons looking guy and he goes hey
*  Hey
*  Did you ever ask him why he's into that?
*  Sort of but no explanation made any sense
*  Okay
*  This other kid I was in jail with I was in protective custody. So if you're in protective custody at jail you you
*  It means you're a murderer a snitch or some sort of celebrity
*  So you're up there with hardcore motherfuckers
*  So this this black kid who was next to me in the cell great kid. I love them
*  I love them
*  But when me and him were both out of the cell together for wreck time
*  I noticed the guards were real protective of me. They're like no they would make him go in the shower and lock the shower while I
*  Walk past them
*  He had some sort of ghetto tourette's or something like because every okay
*  He'd ask you a question about your life and then he would interrupt you by going word up
*  Like every so i'm gonna ask you a question just start the answer. Okay, what's your name? Joe word up?
*  Where are you from?
*  Word up born new jersey word up
*  He kept every 11 seconds. He went word up
*  Word up
*  I love the guy. Why was that? Okay, because i'm locked in myself 23 hours a day
*  One of the guards told me he got chopped up three women. Oh
*  Word up
*  Cut up
*  Yeah
*  So that's the you're rubbing elbows with these guys. Jesus
*  I think he chopped up three girls the most affable
*  I like the kid. I still basketball with him like the
*  The golden state was playing
*  And uh, yeah, because you're you're in solitary confinement. Was he able to have conversations?
*  He he was mentally ill obviously, but but he kept he kept like I heard him on the phone
*  The other thing about jail man, they have tablets now they have the technology so I for one hour a day
*  I was out of my cell
*  And you could play basketball or whatever, but you're in these cages. So they give these young kids
*  Who are in jail for a long time tablets? They could call anybody on the outside
*  So they call their girlfriends, which is always a bad thing like it starts out nice
*  But you hear the build like how you doing baby. Wait, who's that?
*  Who's that in the background who the fuck is that and they start screaming at him and they get violent and
*  I go don't call your girlfriend
*  And when this kid would talk to anybody's life, he kept saying word up
*  Every five seconds, so when you're you're trapped with these guys in your cell for 23 hours a day
*  I add my own solo protective custody of you have your own cell. So and what are you doing when you're in that cell?
*  Well, I wrote I wrote I wrote
*  Again, that helps being creative too. I wrote yeah, and uh, I
*  Read a lot. I had a great lawyer my lawyer at the end sent me a lot of reading material again
*  This was stern fans. Oh, you talk about a crazy. They're also the sweetest people on the planet. They were stern fans all wrote me letters
*  We're rooting for you. I hope you get better
*  They sent me books that they knew I liked
*  And you know you kill time 23 hours a day. So you have a bathroom a patent pen
*  Yeah, so you're writing things out. Yeah, you do write stand up
*  Did you write a lot of stand up and I wrote I wrote this book
*  I have a rough draft for a book, which is all stories. Like I was just telling you, you know, I mean
*  This book I've written three books and they're all crazy stories
*  But this one if I do it the right way
*  Which it's hard to fuck up because it's just repeating these stories. It's gonna be insane
*  I'm sure but I want you to you gotta release an audio version of it. Like there's no way
*  It's gonna do you justice print and form where I have to interpret how you're saying these things the first book
*  I had out too fat to fish which debuted number one of the new york times best of us
*  That's another thing with drugs. I was I read halfway through the audio book and I couldn't do it anymore
*  I was always in withdrawals in the booth. So I quit I just quit in the middle of it
*  So who who read it? I hired two guys with speech impediments. Oh
*  on purpose
*  One guy couldn't read he was reading a book
*  One of the guys had trouble reading and he had to read a book. Oh my god
*  Is that available right now? Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna buy that tonight. I'm gonna buy the audio version
*  Halfway through I just stopped
*  Halfway through I get to chapter six and then I just do a thing. I go guys I quit
*  And they put that in the audio book. Oh, I'm not doing this anymore. Oh my god
*  I'm sweating i'm leaving you hear me like leave the booth. The next thing you hear is
*  Then I had a thing come happen with
*  The studio the studio time took like four four extra months. Oh my god
*  The publisher ran the mask over here. So we're going over time
*  If someone's gonna read the book, they have to not read, you know, who david goggans is
*  The he's a navy seals or yeah, i've heard that name
*  He did a great thing with his book where he wrote a book but in the audio book
*  He had his business partner read it and then he would talk about it afterwards
*  Okay, like almost like a podcast form, right? Right. That's interesting
*  Yeah, because the thing about these stories like the way i'm hearing you say him
*  This is how I want to hear it in the book. Yeah, I don't want to hear you read your book
*  Right, right. I'm saying like absolutely like it's almost like you'd be better off
*  Instead of writing a book if someone just transcribed what you're saying
*  Yeah, yeah, well I tell a lot of these stories. I tell them stand up too
*  Yeah, but if somebody could just get out of the way
*  Yeah, if you can get someone who can interview you who's not going to get in the way
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, like these conversations like just talk and then you just go with it and then that's a good point
*  Well technology is changing that game too. That's a
*  Putting out the idea of like a multimedia book. Yes, you know, yes
*  Well, this is what goggans did he put his book out you could read the book, right?
*  Then the the the audio version is the book plus
*  So it's the book plus him explaining like these stories are actually fucking crazier than i'm even writing in the book
*  There's more to each one of them. Well, you know what's interesting about that the way i've written all three of my books with my buddy
*  My my the co-author anthony boza who wrote he's writing for em and he's writing em and em's book right now
*  And he wrote slash's book right before me tommy lee
*  And uh, he was writing a book with me and cortney love at the same time the kid almost jumped off a building
*  He would listen to cortney love ramble
*  And then he'd come to me i'd be nodding off and then I was just
*  The kid didn't know he was coming or going he wanted to jump off the chrysler building
*  So so
*  And he's got to require the two of you to make a living
*  Oh my god, he needs both of you. Yeah, so oh my god
*  It's funny when me and nick depalo had our own radio show for a little while
*  And uh, we got this big contract and the first time we did stand up at the tower theater of philly nick goes
*  Yeah, my life's great. My entire future depends on arty line
*  Well, that was the attitude that he had on the show too
*  I watched the show because it used to be on television right right was the net was one of the networks that was on
*  Direct tv. Yeah, i was watching. I was like these two are not getting along
*  Like I know both of you
*  And i could and nick is such a grumpy old italian now. He's so funny. But yeah, very funny great joke writer
*  No, absolutely. Yeah, but um, it's two of you guys though
*  It was a weird mix like one guy is like this sort of grumpy guy who likes to complain about things
*  The other guy's getting high all the time
*  Gambling everything that sounds great. Sounds great. Well, maybe you need a third person to like fucking mediate. Yeah, like a law
*  law enforcement
*  Some of you you both respect. Yeah, uh, but um
*  Yes, so so the way we wrote the books was
*  Uh, I would record I would tell the stories like i'm telling them to you into a recorder, right and then we transcribe them
*  Yeah, and so it's almost like you know, the premise was the way mark twain wrote like like you write like people talk
*  That's great. But the original recordings need to be preserved that that's say it again and again
*  Yeah, those recordings exist. Oh, see that's telling the story. That's what you need to release
*  Like that that's what everybody wants right? See the the polished productive
*  Uh produced version of these things is never as good when I try to polish myself. It never works. It doesn't work with anybody
*  Yeah, this would be what people love is like this this conversation we're having right now is just you talking right?
*  This is what people love like they know you have the story. You can't wait to tell it. Oh wait
*  Let me tell you this and then boom it comes out and it's live. It's like hanging out shooting bull
*  Yeah, it's alive. It's alive and when it hits their ears, it's alive
*  Yeah, if there's something missing when people are trying to overproduce things and say that again already, but this time
*  Oh, no, yeah
*  Well, that's why the the hbo show I did for a few years crashing. The appetite was really smart with that
*  He just sort of let me tell talk. Yeah, you know and it worked
*  Um, that's a good point. The stories are the stories are like it's not this stuff's not even the tip of the iceberg
*  It's just like um
*  It's it's chaos that I can't believe I put myself through. I mean god god did spare me
*  I should be dead a million times overdue
*  In a lot of different ways, you know a lot of different ways
*  Just how it was well you're in a very unique position now because you did get through all that
*  Yeah, because you did get through all that and now you're in nine months sobriety and you've got these great stories
*  And you're funnier than ever. It's like it's a very weird position for you to be in because you could help a lot of people
*  With the story i'd love to well again
*  You know when you talk about the method thing with getting clean the 12 step program
*  Which a lot of people obviously if you're not in it
*  You know, it's a legendary iconic program aana
*  But you don't really know what the 12th step is the premise is once you get to the 12th step
*  You by you helping other people it helps you in other words because that's what you're talking about that's a productive way
*  To use your time. Yeah, i'm going to go help this guy like someone in na
*  I'll say there's a guy dying and his family needs us and you don't even know the guy you go and you try to help him
*  So by the end of helping him for five hours, you maybe save him, but you're also saving you because you do so the premise is
*  I'll give you this was very poignant. Uh, one of the speakers and at turning point this guy in rehab really explained it perfectly
*  um
*  At the beginning alcohox anonymous. It's also a great story great american story
*  These two a stockbroker and a a doctor couldn't stop drinking and they realized just by talking to each other
*  They could stop they helped each other
*  So they they devised these 12 steps. So they would go around to hospitals. This is in the mid-30s
*  And uh, they would say to the people at the hospital
*  Is there anybody in the drunk ward like a hopeless alcoholic and they go?
*  Yeah, and they go they don't have any family here and they'd say like his wife is here. She's you know, desperate
*  Can we talk to her?
*  so
*  They would go to the wife the guy's in a hospital bed in in alcoholic withdrawals just a delirium
*  And they would say to her listen, we found the cure for alcoholism. We think we found a cure for alcoholism
*  Can we talk to your husband?
*  And she goes, you know what? I that sounds like a total fantasy to me. You could try we've tried everything
*  I don't know how you're going to cure him and they said no, no, you don't understand
*  He's going to cure us
*  Like by talking to him, we're going to get better
*  Like he's going to cure us and hopefully along the way he gets it
*  Wow, you know, so so that's that's like a simple premise, but that's a stroke of genius in a way
*  It's like you're using your time for something insanely productive and you know, like you're a generous guy you like helping people you're a good friend
*  You know
*  It's you get you get a little bit of a rush you get a lot out of help get a lot
*  I tell people i'm more good selfish generous person
*  Well, they think like the 12 step they say it's true altruism where you know true altruism is
*  You know not the way these big corporations give back but you get nothing in return, right?
*  But in a way that's bullshit because
*  It helps you you get something back. I want to help people I get a rush
*  Like it helps me if you that that feeling you get if you give somebody you love a gift
*  The gift you're trying to give them is look
*  We're trying to get you better and by the time you spend all this time working on them
*  You've stayed clean. You know, it also does it radiates they'll do the same thing
*  They realize that somebody helped them and that it helped you to help them
*  And then they'll do it to someone else and they'll feel it as well and it also spreads the culture of being generous again
*  You're right on the money. That's very insightful because that's what a is. It's a domino effect
*  Yeah, the culture of being generous is very important and the culture of being friendly. You gotta get culture being supportive
*  Yeah, the selfish people they die alone. It's a fucking horrible way to live. Absolutely
*  There's a lot of wealthy people i've met through this business who are just angry motherfuckers
*  They're broken and they don't have anyone to call on there's no one. No one loves them
*  No one hugs them when they see absolutely nobody gets excited. You need that well this business is a particular thing during the the tv era
*  Which I think is kind of gone. I think now we're in the absolutely the internet era is what's happening
*  but the internet era is a much more generous era because
*  it actually helps everybody to have all these shows and no one's competing against each other in a sense because
*  You know it used to be like there was one host of the tonight show and everybody stabbed everybody to get that fucking job
*  Yeah, and that was those late night war the movie with the letterman the stories about cars
*  Now ruthless eos with johan rivers if you tried to go up. Yes. I mean that's how everybody was that way
*  Like I think back then there was a famine mentality because there was such a few there's a few slots
*  And there was hundreds of comics and everybody was just fucking fighting in the trenches with knives. That was the no look again
*  See you though as a good person with character. That's your attitude, which is great
*  You live that lifestyle like in those what you're saying is important
*  Like this is the biggest podcast going if you were hosting the tonight show and look i've been on the tonight show with jimmy
*  Fallon a million times I kill every time but to have me on the mainstream and I love jimmy
*  But to have me on a mainstream show talking like this there's consequences to that corporate wise
*  Yes, they can't do it. They would fight you to have me on. Yeah, so you're in a you're in a situation where
*  Me and you were two guys who've known each other a long time
*  Who respect each other's work and his people and i'm a guy?
*  I mean, let's face it. I'm trying to get back on my feet and you you come to new york and you let me do this
*  That's huge that's something you couldn't do in new york a day early
*  That's why i'm here. I was supposed to I was supposed to land today at four in the afternoon
*  It's downright touching listen. I love you, man
*  I'm happy that you're doing great right now
*  And if I can help put some wind in your sails and keep you moving in this great direction
*  I'm happy to a lot of people telling me like you got a lot of you got a lot of fans in re-app
*  Everybody goes I heard john rogan. I heard john rogan rogan was talking about you and it's always positive and that dude that that
*  Helps me get out of bed some days it does and i'm saying your point is well taken
*  If you were hosting the tonight show you have all these people bad that you can't have arty on right now
*  It's crazy right now even though he needs it, but you in this position you can you could do whatever you want
*  You can do whatever you want and well, we're here right now in lewis's studio
*  Because I mean I guess in some way we're supposed to be competitors or something like that, but we're not no
*  Lewis and I are we're all friends. Yeah, the podcast community is one of the most open supportive communities
*  And right comics now every comic has a fucking podcast and because of that
*  It's like everybody's supporting everybody everybody's helping everybody. Hey dance holders got a new hbl special everybody go watch it
*  Hey, you know, uh re chauffeur's got this thing coming out everybody go check it out. Everybody's helpful and everybody's supporting
*  It also helps that everybody you just mentioned. They're good guys. Yeah, you know, but it's this community
*  It's a different feeling that ever existed during those tonight show wars. No, not even close not even close
*  Those guys hated each other they did even stern when stern with anybody in any other market
*  I saw the howard situation
*  for for eight years that world and uh,
*  how it even says like, you know howard was this
*  Insane ball of talent and ambition and if you got in the way of that train man
*  If you were his competitor, he would go after you your family everything everything
*  It's it's it's I you know, I saw that first hand and you're talking about
*  It's it's it's
*  It's scary, but you're right. This is that's a major positive about this situation
*  but I think even the way howard did it if like
*  I don't think you could do it that way today. No way nobody would accept it. No way. No way. It's a different world. It's uh,
*  There's a lot. There's a lot of people who would check them on it
*  Yeah, you know before it got crazy
*  But you know you talk about every comic everyone has a podcast
*  I used to go to when I went to jail a couple times I get my own cell and they go
*  Why does he have his own cell?
*  Well, because you know, he's on a big radio show and then why do you want your own cell now?
*  Because I have a podcast the guard says well, so do I I have a podcast
*  They do everyone has one, you know, I mean again everybody shoots video
*  It's it's a very I mean look it also inspires a lot of talentless boars to do this. Yes
*  You gotta have something you gotta have some sort of you know
*  but but it's open-ended if you have something to offer and
*  And and someone is a good person and you want to help them you can do it with this platform
*  Yeah, and the the entry it's not expensive like you could you need an iphone and just some sort of a lipsyn account
*  Well, i'm starting another one. Yeah, I know so
*  It's called arty lang's halfway house. I love it. It's great. And the premise is these stories with mike boshetti
*  and uh
*  And and and a lot of the guys I met in these crazy times with these crazy stories
*  They're the most unique stories on the planet. Well, you were doing a podcast from your apartment for a while, right?
*  For two years, but I was on you know, I was running I was on drugs. Yeah
*  I mean, okay. I did a I did a podcast in my living room. I was late 18 times
*  Puerto rican comedians were beating me in my kitchen. That's hilarious. That's hilarious
*  Yeah, I I I was late 18 times that's hilarious I wouldn't you know people are waiting outside
*  And I caught traffic by the bathroom, I would say
*  Uh, so that's how out of control it was my friend jay is one of the producers of uh, the doctors and they were going to fix
*  Your nose. Yeah, but they're worried that if they did it
*  They'd have to give you painkillers, right?
*  Well, that's that's a big thing too like uh with the drug court thing if you get any type of surgery
*  They gotta do paperwork also the guy from botched wants to do it too
*  I'm actually in a bidding war to fix my nose. What happened to it?
*  Uh, a bunch of things 30 years of drugs, right?
*  Okay, you want to hear stories?
*  Uh, first of all a bookie. I was dealing with a few years ago had a guy who used to work for him who?
*  Uh got this idea to try to get money out of me and he he sucker punched me at my this kid was a 19
*  Year old boxer and uh, he came I was going to my car one day and he thought I was like he saw me on tv
*  He thought I was like a billionaire
*  and um
*  I'm going to my car and I hear arty and the kid hits me with a right hand, right?
*  I just like I mean like you could never get off on a regular fight, you know
*  Like like the way kyson hit trevor burbick
*  And right here right here right on my and collapse and collapse the bone right here
*  Knock me out for 10 minutes at least 10 minutes
*  and uh
*  and and you know that situation got solved the way it got solved but uh,
*  You know, I what does that mean? Well, I just had to deal with it in my own way
*  I made up with the guy through, you know, intermediaries on the street
*  And everybody's fine and we moved on but the kid laid me out the kid
*  I mean, it is a 19. I just boom and uh, so that's one thing
*  30 years of drug use but this is one of the craziest stories
*  So there was this stripper I used to go on the road with and she would meet me in city
*  She's actually from boston. She was from she was from southy and she was hot
*  But when she like talked orange sex, she sounded like mark warburg
*  That accent so gross
*  Fuck me your wicked heart fuck, you know
*  But she was she was beautiful and over the years like I would meet her at hotels she would call me on the road
*  And she was a drug addict
*  We used to snort drugs together. So we're at a hotel in st. Louis. It's about it's kind of about five years ago now
*  No, no less three four years ago
*  and um, we're snorting oxycote
*  So to to to to snort the pills you got to crush them up
*  So we're in this hotel room this nice hotel room. I got a show that night at a big theater
*  and um, uh
*  I go I take a shower she takes out like like about about five pills and starts crushing them
*  Now it was a nice hotel. So we had room service the room service had a salt shaker. That was glass
*  So she couldn't crush one of the pills. She takes
*  She takes the salt shaker and starts hitting the pill with it and the salt shaker breaks
*  glass breaks, okay, so then she takes a credit card and and
*  You know makes it into a fine powder a fine dust not knowing there's all glass in in the powder
*  She cuts out like four lines
*  She gets called down to the desk
*  To go to I bought her a gift so she goes down to get the gift I come out of the
*  Out of the bathroom, I see the lines and I take a I take a pen that I cut down
*  And I snort one of the lines and there's glass in it
*  I snorted glass and oxycote. Oh shit. So it sounded like a zipper
*  I just went I saw one picture of your nose where was enormously swollen. That's after the kid punched me
*  That was after he punched that was after the kid punched me. Yeah, you know
*  He he tweeted it out he was trying to be a jerk off he put he took a picture of me with my phone and tweeted it
*  He was he had a bad plan, but it that way to try to get money out of me
*  uh and the bookie
*  um who uh, it's a long story, but anyway, uh, he uh
*  That that was after I got punched. Yeah, so that got out all over the place. Yeah, and again, that's my life
*  That's the chaos that was my life, but I snorted a line of oxycote and that all glass fine
*  Cut up glass it sounded like a zipper. It's like
*  And then my nose just started to it just
*  It just went nuts. It was bleeding
*  And I went to the hospital. I had to cancel the show and I wanted to strangle the girl
*  And that's when it caved in
*  That it all it all that that started the process if you watch the show crashing
*  You I'm on that three seasons. You could see my nose morphing into what it is now
*  Like from a regular nose to like what it is now and again part of me
*  I I tell young kids a part of me doesn't want to get it fixed because every time I look in the mirror
*  I go, this is a life
*  this is this is
*  What happened to me? Yeah, it's a reminder maybe to
*  To not fuck up again. Yeah, and maybe it tells kids that so it's just such a dangerous thing to get it fixed and then to
*  Be in that kind of intense pain and then have the temptation to take a pill the premise is while you're in the hospital you get
*  What you need because you can't get it's an operation. So they gotta put you out. They put you out
*  Yeah, but then afterwards look I had my deviated septum fixed right and they gave me a couple different painkillers that I didn't use
*  I I got out and I was I I didn't use them when I had knee surgery either
*  Okay, let me ask you something see see this fascinates me
*  So as a guy who gets obsessed with stuff right and you feel that euphoria at that morphine drip
*  Yeah
*  The the obsession over that feeling is not as strong as you not wanting to fuck your life up not even close
*  Yeah, I know I know it feels great. But my brain is like uh-uh. Okay out of here
*  Cover your cover your hand tuck your chin bob and weave get the fuck out of the corner. Right get out of there
*  Right. Okay. Here's what a drug here's what a drug addict is. This is where they claim. It's a disease
*  I'm smart enough to realize that too, but I do it anyway. Yeah, i'm the direct opposite
*  I never I never got into the drugs at a young age, but still you feel that feeling
*  Yeah, you know what I mean? Like like like, you know that that's something like like, you know to me the sick person is
*  Why don't you want to feel like that all the time? You know?
*  Yeah, it's crazy. Like some people have a a painkiller prescription all these pills in a bottle and they don't finish it
*  I think that premise to me. Yeah, I sold mine. Yeah
*  I was like that's what I took percocets. I think it was percocets when I had my first knee operation after the morphine drip
*  I got out they gave me percocets. I took it one day and it was it made me so stupid
*  Okay, I remember sitting on my couch going god. I'm so dumb right now. I can't think okay. I got to I
*  I took in one day. I counted because I was obsessed with I took 123 percocet in one day
*  Oh my god, so I got pancreatitis
*  Jesus christ, I was on the liver list and then my liver came back
*  Oh again, you talk about you're on the transplant list
*  They they were about to put me on the list. The doctor said to my family said to my mother's sister
*  He's gonna need a liver
*  This is like this is five years ago because I I got out of control with the percocets
*  Which is why I went back to snort and I was trying to snort. I was taking oral for your health. Yeah, right
*  It's better for your liver
*  So once that once you snort the glass how do they get it out of your nose
*  Well, I had to go to the emergency while I was in the hospital for like four days
*  What do they do? They cut it out?
*  They yeah, they had it they had to go in they do a surgery where they knock you out
*  They gotta go up and they clean it out and then I had surgery again a couple years ago to do it
*  So there's no like I can breathe good and everything now. I don't know, you know, but again
*  It would take a piece of your rib. That's what they do
*  They take your cartilage from in between your rib, which will eventually grow back and then they would prop it up
*  They do it to fighters. Yeah
*  The guy at the doctors I went to go see him the guy
*  And he was like, I don't know
*  He goes he never saw he goes he never saw a worse nose. Wow. He looked in the nose. He goes
*  I never saw a worse nose. That's incredible. Yeah. Congratulations. Yeah
*  I'm very goal oriented but if they did fix it, you know
*  The real issue would be what it feels like when you get out of the hospital, right?
*  And you know how whether or not that would disrupt your progress enough the point we absolutely back
*  Well again, i'm making more more mature decisions now because I could have went right into this
*  but uh
*  And again, the doctor at botched was was cool about it, too
*  You said you need more clean time at least a year before you even try it
*  Yeah, well good for him for thinking that way instead of just I mean look a big episode for them
*  And again, if I can't if I couldn't breathe it'd be one thing but I can breathe all right and like well
*  You know, I never looked like david beckham. Anyway, what do I care? Yeah, it's gotta give you some material on stage as well. Absolutely
*  I say stop to smell the roses in life and they had cocaine on them
*  It uh, it's it's it's been an odyssey of craziness
*  My life has just been an odyssey of craziness now
*  We tried to do this in la one of the reasons why I had to come to new york is they they wouldn't your parole officer
*  Would not let you right now probe the probation i'm on doesn't let you travel more
*  You can't leave the state more than 24 hours. So when you go to do a gig like and come back that night
*  I used to do that. Anyway, right I used to I I don't love staying like poughkeepsie. I'm in poughkeepsie tonight
*  And it's a two hour, you know, and i'm coming right back. Yeah, I like that one show the other thing
*  I used to get you know, whenever I tried to come back
*  I'd get greedy and I would start doing two three shows a night for the money
*  I'm doing I do one show mostly in a night so you don't get burnt out
*  I do you know you time it out you pace out your energy. Yes, do the one show and I come back
*  I take the I mean because the money is good enough. What what do I you know, I mean, right don't get crazy
*  Yeah, yeah, don't get crazy. Don't put your your health at risk. Don't don't stress yourself out. The good thing is is that
*  You know that sort of mature thinking you have about not wanting to fuck up your life. I'm starting
*  Each day I get more and more to thinking that way. Mm-hmm. So it's improving still. Yeah, even though you're nine months in it's a constant
*  It's so it's I mean that's like like endurance like you're strengthening your endurance your resolve
*  Mentally more than anything. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's it's almost all mental at this point. It is. Yeah at this point it is
*  You know, you just gotta I mean again something spared me and i'm 52
*  I would love my legacy to be someone that helped people but you know
*  Even when you already have whether you realize it or not and I guarantee you if you keep going you will I hope so
*  You will no, it's 100 percent if you if you keep going with these stories with your your
*  Personality and your sense of humor. This is 100 percent going to help people and not just a few
*  Fucking millions of people, you know, robert daddy jr. Uh,
*  I I when the paperback version of my first book came out I wrote a
*  Paragraph about him to where you know again about the the ruthlessness of show business people say show business is very forgiving
*  Well, if you're that talented of an actor like robert daddy jr. They they let you come back. Yeah
*  Uh and um
*  Through his assistant he contacted me and um
*  Was so was so nice like, you know, and again at this point he was iron man, you know, and um, he uh
*  You know and i'm this comedian. He's a big stern fan
*  He had read the book and he appreciated that I that I was complimented to him in the book
*  And again, there's an example of the 12 step stuff. He really was like he goes on through
*  He said basically to me i'm here for you
*  If you need me i'm here for you joe walsh from the eagles who I met through the stern show same thing
*  Hmm, you know, that's amazing, you know
*  Like like these guys are like because it um, it helps them
*  It helps everybody so so robert downy helped me in a way just by knowing that he got better
*  Because you talk about chaos his life was I remember talking about him on a stern show when he got found
*  You know the stripper with the wonder woman outfit and crystal
*  Yeah, stripper dressed like wonder woman and crystal meth in somebody else's house
*  Like you know, but i've always wondered like a guy like that. That's so fucking talented
*  He's he's talented in this weird explosive sort of creepy. He's unique. He's a unique guy
*  If you watch his movies, even though he's in a shit movie, he's great
*  Yeah, like you always look at what he's doing. He makes unique choices as an actor
*  I've always wondered if like the engine behind that is the same engine of addiction. Absolutely impulsive wild
*  Reckless sort of energy and now he just contains it in progress and success like he's constantly working
*  I mean, I don't know him personally just just through that contact. I just told you about but
*  uh, it seems like he's
*  Like way into the program of a a or n a yeah, I mean and again
*  It's also like the premise of going to a meeting. Um, uh an na meeting
*  I try to go to five or six a week now and that's not even you know
*  They they want you to go to 90 and 90 there's a lot of comedians in recovery, you know
*  I won't mention who they are but you know, it's an anonymous thing
*  But there's so many guys were 20 years ago. There was a stigma attached to it. There's not anymore
*  I think people understand now. It's not being weak. Yeah, people used to think it's weak
*  It's like it's these are behavior patterns. They're thought patterns and you get stuck in a rut of them
*  You get there's a smooth carved path
*  That your behavior just slides right in and goes and it's hard to hit those fucking brakes and stop that path
*  Yeah, and you use the behaviors to manipulate like if you have a talent like a sense of humor, you know, it's funny
*  I one of my po's said to me
*  Uh, you're gonna tell me you never used your sense of humor to obtain drugs
*  I go, I don't know what drug dealers, you know, but jokes as payment like listen noodles. I want that ounce of cocaine
*  I have no cash but knock knock
*  Well, it's not gonna work you use your sense of humor to get the money to buy
*  The
*  Indirectly what what what the people at the task evaluators of drug court a lot of these these rehabs do is they link exactly what you just said
*  They link every behavior back to yeah the drug use. Yeah, like what why why act in this way?
*  Why being charming if you can be charming? So you can't be charming. So we'll just rob you. Yeah, you know
*  Well, I was talking with this
*  About this with a friend of mine recently about girls about like basically every comic really became funny
*  Because they were trying to figure out a way to get girls. That's the first thing pussy 100
*  I mean with men you try to explain it to women like like for me
*  Like like you're up to about 11 or 12
*  All you want to do is hit a home run a little league and then one summer
*  You see a set of tits or something and then it's all about pussy. That's it. You just got to try to get pussy
*  Yeah, and and then that is talk about an addiction
*  Yeah
*  Oh my god
*  If you get involved like the girl I was telling you about if you get involved with a chick who's got a drug problem
*  With opioids and is good looking till you want to fuck
*  You're talking about adolf hitler you're talking chicks are manipulative already
*  But if you have a pussy and a drug problem
*  What did richard priors say because I don't know why bitches always complaining. They got half the money and all the pussy
*  That richard priors that's socrates type shit that sums up life that that literally should be on his fucking grave
*  They got half the money and all the pussy
*  I'll give you another story. Okay, you ready? This is being a drug addict
*  I was with this other girl at martha's vineyard
*  This is like 20 years ago and I went to visit john belushi's grave on big belushi fam
*  I had an eight ball of coke on me and everybody at belushi's grave
*  I was in paris once where I got arrested for drunkenness. But anyway, uh, I they do this at jim mahr's grave people leave bottles of booze
*  Like heroin needles sometimes loaded on jim mahr's grave. So people have beers and everything on belushi's grave
*  So I took the eight ball of coke out and I took half of it and I left a couple of rocks
*  On top of belushi's headstone at like three in the afternoon and I said that's on me john
*  Four o'clock in the morning. I went back and got it
*  It was still there. Yeah
*  At four o'clock in the morning me and the girl ran out of coke and I said is it raining she goes why I go
*  Come on. We're gonna go back
*  Oh my god, I went back and got the cocaine. Oh my god. He didn't need it anymore
*  The gesture was already in place. Could you imagine though the the retarded the the level of retardedness?
*  That is your life at that point. I'm with a girl at four in the morning and I know is it raining
*  She goes why because I left the coke on the thing and we're both hoping he can get you know
*  Oh my god another another guy a young kid
*  The other great thing about a meetings is you you will someone could say the most profound thing from any walk of life
*  like some some professor who's a genius and mit could be in a meeting with a cook at a
*  Diner and the cook says something because he's got a different perspective on it. This kid said once
*  Who's a janitor the best part about cocaine is going to get it
*  And that is totally that's the smartest fucking thing. It sounds so simple. But when you hear someone has it you go
*  I always said i'm surprised a lawyer a prosecutor hasn't tried to convict somebody on this yet
*  They call dui driving under the influence
*  You're totally under the influence of drugs driving to get them. I don't care if they're in your body yet
*  You're under the influence of drugs. You want to get high you're speeding to get to the dealer
*  So if you kill a kid
*  on the way to get coke
*  They're going to test you it's not in your body, but you were totally under the influence of cocaine
*  You know, I mean, I mean that's like I'm from I just have opened up a whole new
*  Can of worms. I don't want I don't want my brothers together
*  But i'm saying like am I under the influence? It's not in me, but it's on influence by completely
*  Yeah, and it is it's like it's like a kid on christmas morning
*  If you're a drug addict you anticipate that see I equated it with fun the gambling, you know
*  Yeah, because what's gambling? It's just instant fun. Yeah, you're bored to death
*  No, you still watching sports. Yeah, I don't like it as much
*  Of course not
*  I used to bet again. I like pure gambling people who uh
*  People who bet on stuff and handicap it that's like a job who wants a job. I don't want a job
*  About all the research on a fucking game. I just want to bet find out who's injured. Yeah
*  Yeah, I don't want to do any of that shit
*  That's not action because then you kind of know what might happen
*  I I used to I used to go to the mirage sports book in vegas
*  They have a line on everything you could bet on two kids playing wiffle ball in minnesota at the mirage
*  They have a line on everything. It's just it's just the it's heaven for gamblers
*  so
*  I would bet on sports. I knew nothing about and do cocaine and like four o'clock in the morning
*  I'm going around people at the bar going. Hey, did you see the high school across scores?
*  I got ramapo versus dom bosco prep
*  I would bet on lacrosse because I knew nothing about it. Wow, I would put each super bowl from
*  2004 to 11. I had 10 grand on the coin toss
*  10 grand on the coin toss and seven of the times I probably
*  Five times I probably lost so before the kickoff I was down 10 grand
*  Now how far behind are you if you all lifetime if you want to look at lifetime gambling how far just gambling?
*  Yeah, yeah
*  Because everybody's behind like I don't know any point two million. Wow
*  Probably three point two million is what I've lost gambling. Holy shit
*  If I had to be I do that math in my head a couple of you know, yeah
*  I'd say i've got about three over three million specific 3.2 is very specific. Yeah, because I I updated in my head
*  Because i'm obsessed about that too
*  I
*  I had an uncle I had an uncle I used to do this joke of my eye
*  My uncle was a degenerate gambler and he said, you know our when I was a kid
*  I was into the jets
*  And then I got into girls and then I got back into the jets because I realized there's times when a girl won't fuck you
*  But the jets will always fuck
*  He's so right, oh, you know, so you can't figure it out
*  I don't want to like the coin toss is pure gambling heads or fucking tails. Yeah 10 000
*  When that's about to happen, I can't describe it. What's the rush when it gets heads and you call the heads?
*  It's like pussy. Yeah, it's almost like it's not like pussy, but it's something it's it's close to it
*  Yeah
*  And then so now how do I keep that fucking going?
*  And when you were on stern too, it came up so it was almost kind of encouraged because it was a thing again
*  Howard gets a bad rap sometimes I don't mean encouraged by him
*  Again again howard tried to help me a lot and he was he was good to me
*  I just he he didn't like again when you're in a junkie's life eventually you don't know what to do
*  Right, you don't know what to do if you don't live that life like howard and I a lot of our
*  Rapport on the air worked because he was the most disciplined human being ever and I was the most undisciplined
*  It was like the odd couple
*  So he from the first time I went in there with norm mcdonald. I had the story about getting arrested at mad tv
*  He just he goes I said I love out of control guys are fun
*  Yeah, so when I got on the show, it's four and a half hours you're filling every day
*  It was part of my life
*  So I would talk about going to vegas and gambling and you know, but I i'm on the you know, i'm on the air
*  You're the camera's always on you on that show. So i'm on the air committing felonies like like I got i'm talking to bookies
*  dealers hookers
*  I there was a guard there after heath ledger died as a joke. I said I had the same dealer as he ledger as a joke
*  And it was a joke the dea shows up at at stern with the with the with the windbreakers on says
*  We've got to talk to arty pull me out there on a commercial. I'm like i'm at work, bro
*  And they said and I I was joking around I told him I was I was joking around
*  And one of the guards who worked there said arty man, you are one entertainer. Fuck up
*  He goes the guard was like he told him so he goes the dea
*  Dea
*  You made it you made it what the fuck you doing the dea is here
*  Goes motherfucker
*  The dea and howard just looked at me he gave me the look great giordano gave me
*  In my head I sometimes when I think of greg, you know, you have all these moments where like like just that moment that one moment
*  Aren't you fat fucking drug addict?
*  You can't kiss farrah forst
*  Who tells another guy that
*  And the crazy thing is if you see greg on
*  Stage you see with the microphone you would never think he's out of control. No, because he was so smart
*  Oh, absolutely writing was so good. Absolutely. He seemed so educated and smooth. Here's not okay
*  The last movie chris farley ever did was dirty work. So i'm in the movie
*  and
*  After right after dirty work right before he passed away
*  Uh, he hosted siren at life. So norm was still doing weekend updates
*  So norm caught me up and said listen farley's out of control with coke come to the party after the show because I got you
*  Gotta help me watch him like that's how bad he was. I was watching you had to help watch
*  I had to help watch him. Okay. So this is this is how fast norm is though. This is a testament to norm's wit
*  So
*  So i'm at the party and norm is talking to somebody and i'm watching chris
*  I'm on coke i'm coked up. So so so
*  I see farley disappear into a bathroom with andy dick. Oh, okay him and andy go into a bathroom
*  They come out five minutes later. They giggle him
*  Norm comes over to me and goes what's going on with chris. I go bad news, bro
*  He goes what I go. He went to a bathroom with andy dick
*  I said there's only two reasons a man goes into a bathroom with andy dick and neither one of them's good
*  And norm looked at me without missing a beat and said holy fuck. I hope he's high
*  You see norm say that holy fuck I hope he's high it's a great impression to norm
*  holding his stomach
*  Good news. He was high
*  Chris farley showed up on the set of news radio one day to visit andy. Yeah, i'm sure he did
*  He had the complexion of wet cardboard
*  I've never seen a man look more unhealthy dude. I went to a strip club with him in taranto
*  He shot the movie at taranto. He had chicks hanging. I mean he was just like, oh out of control
*  Yeah, and when he died and that chick took a picture of him with the foam coming out of his mouth laying on the ground
*  Yeah, that's where you knew it was gonna end. That's the people you're around exactly exactly. Yeah, it's like yeah
*  Uh, so one quick mitch edberg story
*  So I opened up for mitch edberg like 22 years ago and he comes up to me after the show and he goes
*  Hey arty, man, you're a fat guy. I go that's what he said. I go I could lose a couple but what are you talking about?
*  He goes I wrote a joke that um
*  I can't do because i'm not fat but I give it to you
*  I got it goes you know when you're a kid and they tell you to wait a half an hour after you eat before
*  You go swimming and i'm like, yeah
*  He goes you should say you've never been swimming because it's never been more than a half an hour since you last ate
*  And I go that's a great joke and I I could have that joke he goes. Yeah
*  So then he comes back and he was smoking a lot of weed
*  So he comes back totally serious. He goes. Hey man, you're right. That is a good joke
*  I'll make you a deal if I gave like 100 pounds before you do that on tv. I get the joke
*  I'm like, all right, whatever. So, okay, so cut to like a month later. I'm with norm mcdonald having dinner with people
*  And norm does that joke about me? He goes. Hey, man, it's uh, arty's never been swimming
*  It's never more than a half an hour since he last ate i'm like where the fuck did you hear that joke?
*  He goes he goes I heard a fat guy do it at the comedy store. I go really so I see mitch two weeks later
*  I go mitch what the fuck bro. You gave me that joke norm said he saw a fat guy do it at the college
*  So he's all fucked up and he goes hey arty man, you know, listen, i'm sorry, you know, I I I get fucked up
*  A lot I forget shit. I probably gave that to a lot of fat guys
*  I
*  He was the weirdest joke writer ever because it was all silly non-sequiturs
*  Everything was a non-sequitur. No bits transferred into other jokes joke joke joke joke joke
*  It's great to watch mitch like I I I get such a kick out of watching him now
*  Uh do a set where he starts off bombing
*  Like like he'll tell a joke and the audience doesn't get it
*  Yeah, and he'll go like, okay, you guys don't like me yet
*  Uh, i'll keep trying and then he gets him and then the first big laugh he gets he's like a little kid
*  He goes, yeah
*  He was my favorite to listen to I listened to his album on the way to the airport
*  Oh, because lax traffic so horrible and it was so silly. Yeah, it's silly and just and smart at the same time smart and silly
*  One of my favorite jokes ever is uh, somebody said do you want a frozen banana?
*  I said no, but I want a regular banana later. So yes
*  Well, he did a joke once he did this joke on tv somewhere and you can almost tell he paused before he did it
*  Because he got a lot of trouble. He goes my fedex dealer is my fedex man is a drug dealer and he doesn't know it. Yeah
*  I mean that's like fucking you know, all right, I used to do drugs
*  I still do drugs, but I used to do
*  Well, the crazy thing about him is he would do you know an hour 10 minutes of that like
*  How the fuck do you remember what you said and don't say when you're on heroin? No, no
*  Well, well, that's the thing. I forget shit all the time
*  Like I said, like I bet on the other team. Yes with the bookie
*  I would bet on the other team but he was high when he was doing shows, right?
*  And and and at the end the last time I saw Mitch was two weeks before he died at stern
*  And then I went to go see him at carolines and it was like you're watching this
*  This genius shell a shell of literally a shell like like he was he was you know
*  Taking drugs from people in the audience pills. I took a birth control pill once because I thought it was a viking and some woman gave me
*  I didn't have the baby it worked but uh, he was like scratching at the walls and shit
*  I'll give you I'll give you a little more quick norm thing. So when dirty work came out I got awful reviews
*  And the reviewer of my hometown paper said arty lang has all the charm of a date rapist
*  That's what it said. So norm goes like this. He goes. Hey, man, that's fucking great
*  I go why he goes a date rapist has to have way more charm than a regular rapist
*  And that made me feel better, uh, yeah, so I mean listen man, uh
*  I'm alive. I don't know
*  You're healthy you're happy
*  You know one of the things that I i've noticed when I started seeing you do these little instagram videos. It's like your your eyes
*  Yeah, your eyes are there your present which is that that was what was interesting
*  There was a sparkle to your eyes that wasn't there the last time that I saw you right?
*  Well, everything changes man. You look at someone's eyes, especially if you're like can't fedemite and stuff. They become peed. Yeah, you know, uh,
*  Yeah, you're putting poison in your body so you know I stopped doing that listen if you ever need anything from me
*  I'm here just just reach out. I actually want my mother's got glaucoma
*  You know that guy you have on the show david st. Clair. Yes, I I need I need a
*  Contact for him because my mother needs that that optic nerve thing. She heard about yeah
*  I don't know what they're doing with that yet. Yeah, they're they've got something where they're going to inject bacteria
*  That's somehow or another
*  Altered into your eye and it's going to fix people's vision. Well, that's how wide your audience is
*  My mom said oh joe rogan had a guy on about optic nerve. Yeah, so uh, I gotta david st. Clair is his name
