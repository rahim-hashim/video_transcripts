# Joe Rogan Experience #1561 - Kermit Pattison
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 10, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8M1ZRYt-2Q)
*  Welcome. Thanks for doing this, man. I really appreciate it. I'm very, very fascinated by
*  this subject. Well, thank you for having me. It's great to be here. So this is a long journey
*  for you to have written this book and to be involved in this project. Can you talk us
*  through how you got involved in this? Sure. It was completely unintentional. I had started off
*  working on a different book on the evolution of human locomotion. And I mean, just as an aside,
*  humans are weird primates in a lot of ways. But one way we're weird is just we were slow,
*  we're weak, but we have this ability to walk and run long distances, which is kind of unique. So
*  I thought, okay, I mean, I'm not certainly a lot of other people have noted that before. But as
*  far as I was concerned, no one had really written the deep history of that. So I was going to go
*  sort of investigate the anthropology of where this weird human capacity came from. And, you know,
*  so I thought that the early human history like Artie would be this, you know, a little sliver
*  of background before I got to the interesting stuff. But anyway, I started reading the Artie
*  papers and they kind of undercut a lot of the things that I had the research community had taken
*  for granted, or at least challenge them, let's say. And so anyway, I started talking to the people
*  on the Artie team and then thinking, Oh, tell me about how you found this thing. Oh, that sounds
*  pretty interesting. And then so I thought, okay, well, maybe Artie, maybe it'll be a page, it's
*  more than this little line, then, you know, a little, little more. That's five pages. Actually,
*  this is a whole chapter. No, this is three chapters. Oh, this is, and then at some point after this
*  agonizing time of reappraisal, I said, you know what, this is much better than the actual story
*  I was working on. I mean, this is a discovery that is has been announced to the world, but it hasn't
*  really been described in detail. And it's interesting at a whole number of different levels. I mean,
*  there's the anatomy, it's just the exploring the natural history of the human body, literally from
*  head to toe, because the skeleton was so remarkably complete, they had a skull, they had hands, they
*  had feet, and the hands and feet were almost complete, which is unheard of. I mean, you're
*  lucky to find any skeleton at this age, and to get something that's that complete is really unusual.
*  And so there are other parts of the skeleton too. But so it sort of became a way to sort of tickle
*  this interest I had in like the natural history of the human body and human biology. So that's the
*  science of it. And then the discovery story, the sheer adventure story was just astounding to me
*  when I started talking to the field crew in particular, and hearing about how they all the
*  challenges in the field. And oh my god, I mean, this is like collision of cultures in the Ethiopian
*  desert, you know, the indigenous Afar people and the highland Ethiopians, and then the foreigner,
*  you know, the Americans, the Japanese, you know, coming in and all, you know, meeting and the
*  additional meetings were not friendly, you know, I mean, we got guys coming out, Afar guys coming
*  out with guns and saying, you know, get the hell out of here. And so that part is fascinating. And
*  then the drama of discovery and there's bullets flying overhead. And there's this excitement of
*  finding one little piece and another little piece. Anyway, to make a long story short, I kind of
*  stumbled on this and every time I turned over a rock, there was something interesting. And then
*  it got, you know, more interesting once this whole saga kind of moved into the lab, because, you
*  know, there's this old cliche in the science and that is it's not so much what you find, it's what
*  you find out. So in other words, when you find a skeleton or something like that, the truths that
*  contains the scientific revelations aren't immediately evident, you know, you look at the
*  skeletons, oh, that's, you know, this, that, I mean, these people spend years studying this
*  thing, measuring, you know, thinking about it. So there was also this other detective story that
*  sort of followed the field. There's a lab detective story that sort of followed the field detective
*  story that went along with it. And then, and of course, when this thing finally was revealed to
*  the world, there was this, again, another clash, you know, this time a clash in the world of
*  science and academia about people taking issue with the interpretation or denying its importance
*  or trying to trying to bury the skeleton again, if you will, you know, with inattention and denial.
*  So anyway, long story short, it just, you know, I didn't set out to do this, but it just sort of
*  dawned on me that this was like a huge scientific saga that was still mostly untold.
*  We should fill people in on exactly what we're talking about. So we're talking about a skeleton
*  that was discovered that is 1.2 million years older than Lucy. So yeah,
*  the skeleton is yeah, it's 4.4 million years old.
*  The oldest known human relative.
*  Well, it's the oldest known skeleton that actually this is an important distinction I should make.
*  So, like I said before, skeletons are rare.
*  This is the oldest skeleton. There are three other members of the human family that are older.
*  But the thing is, they're much more fragmentary. They're not anywhere near as complete.
*  Like there's one, another one from Ethiopia found by the same team that found the skeleton we're talking about.
*  That's, you know, some teeth, you know, like a toe bone, a few other broken elements of the skeleton.
*  There's another thing, another species called aurora from Kenya, which is about 6 million years old.
*  Again, you know, much more fragmentary, some teeth. I think they've got a couple thigh bones, partial thigh bones.
*  And then there's a skull from Chad called Salanthropus that's about 6 million, maybe 7 years old,
*  depending on who's dating you, believe. And that's a very nice skull, but it's a head without body.
*  So anyway, so there are people sometimes get confused by this. So Artie is indeed the oldest skeleton.
*  It's by far more complete than this other stuff. But there are some fragmentary things that are older.
*  And they all become part of the story, too.
*  And what is the scientific controversy? Do you think it's, is it based on real skepticism?
*  Or is ego involved in this? You're laughing.
*  Ego? In science? What are you talking about?
*  It's unfortunate, man.
*  No, no, these are scientists. No, no. Yeah, yeah.
*  There's a lot of egos involved in science, unfortunately, right?
*  Yeah, there's a lot of egos. There's a lot of disbelief because the skeleton was so surprising in a lot of ways.
*  And so contrary to the predictions that many people in science had made, that there was kind of like a, you know,
*  a head explode for a lot of people.
*  So we should break down those particular things that are different than what was expected, right?
*  First of all, it walked upright.
*  Yeah, so it walked upright. So it's primitive. I mean, if you saw, you know, if we could go back in the time machine and look at it,
*  you know, this thing, the species name is Ardipithecus ramidus.
*  That's kind of a mouthful. But Ardi is the individual skeleton that they found.
*  That's, you know, the individual like, like you're Joe, you're the individual and your species is Homo sapiens.
*  That's how you think about this. Ardipithecus ramidus species, Ardi, the individual skeleton.
*  So the interesting revelations with it is it has upright posture.
*  So it's standing upright, but it's still got the opposable toe.
*  So this is a creature that was in the trees, you know, clearly climbing, but it also appears to be upright walking with this opposable toe.
*  So it has seemed it, you know, everyone knows that sometime deep in the human past, there was some kind of a boreal ancestor,
*  you know, some kind of ape. But, you know, the question has always been, well, what, what kind of ape?
*  Does it look like a modern ape or does it look like, you know, something we've never seen before?
*  And so the surprising thing about Ardi is it's actually quite different than the living apes.
*  So, yeah, so it's got the opposable toe walks upright.
*  Are there proportions? Chimps have shorter legs than they have arms.
*  Is Ardi's proportions similar to that?
*  No, Ardi, I mean, it's certainly more ape like than than than than any of us.
*  But it's there's a couple of interesting things about its proportions.
*  So all the other living apes have longer arms than they do legs.
*  They spend a lot of time climbing. That's, you know, that's, you know, long arms, long.
*  And they have, you know, they're different proportions, but they all have that in common.
*  They got longer forelimbs than hindlimbs.
*  Ardi was a big surprise because it actually had longer legs than forelimbs.
*  I mean, you know, it definitely has bigger hands, has longer arms than we do.
*  But, you know, that was a surprise, at least was to me and I think to some of the researchers.
*  And, you know, I was talking before about these kind of surprises that appear after the fact.
*  Well, that that was one because the bones are broken.
*  You know, these guys on this research team, it's called the middle outwash research project.
*  They spent a lot of time reconstructing this and then estimating how well the
*  lengths of the pieces that are not there and then run all kinds of regressions and
*  a lot of calculations and stuff.
*  But so that revelation was sort of a delayed, you know, delayed bombshell, if you will,
*  that it actually had these limber portions of that were more like a biped.
*  And so ours, our legs are longer chimps have longer arms.
*  So is this like does it have almost equal length arms and legs like
*  Jamie actually just put a photo of it up here and I'm getting a chance to take a look at.
*  Oh, it's fascinating.
*  So it has long legs, almost like a person, but longer arms than we do.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Longer arms than we do for sure.
*  I think I don't remember the exact name, but I think the calculation they did was that legs
*  are I think the arms.
*  Yeah. I want to say it's like 90 something percent.
*  So it's pretty close to one to one of length, but indeed the arms are a bit shorter.
*  So the surprising part was that it didn't walk at all on its knuckles,
*  being that it was that old.
*  Yeah. So humans are, we come from the African apes.
*  That's pretty clear from genetics. That's been clear for a long time.
*  There are two main groups of African apes. There's gorillas and there's chimps.
*  And chimps also includes this other species you might have heard of called bonobos.
*  And within that was just like debate about, should we divide them into some
*  subspecies and stuff. But don't worry about that for now.
*  But anyway, what they all have in common is they knock a walk.
*  So they got these long fingers and when they walk, they do this.
*  If you look at a video sometime, you'll see it.
*  And because our two closest cousins both do that, there was a perfectly plausible theory that
*  human ancestors did it well. So we evolved from a knock a walking ancestor.
*  There was even a cover story in Nature that the headline was almost that.
*  Humans evolved from a knock a walking ancestor.
*  So that was the theory. And then so here with Artie, we have a creature that's,
*  it's not the last common ancestor with the African apes, but it's certainly getting closer.
*  It's getting a big step closer. And the people, the anatomists who specialize in these things
*  say that there's like no hint of knock a walking. Not only was it not knock a walking
*  to get around, but also it has no vestige of a knock a walking ancestry.
*  So in other words, there's no like residual anatomy that would suggest that.
*  That it ever. Yeah.
*  So it was bipedal from the very early days.
*  Very, very early days of the species evolution.
*  Well, it's bipedal.
*  All you know is what you find at that 4.4 million year old window.
*  What comes before that is.
*  Speculation.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's these people that do this, it's intelligent speculation, obviously,
*  but you don't know what you haven't found. And so now the, I mean, there's a debate about
*  just how long ago the last common ancestor of humans and chimps lived.
*  It's probably at least, you know, anywhere from 1.5 million years before Arte to,
*  you know, some estimates put it even further back than that. So.
*  Yeah, there's another school of thought that's kind of emerged that says, well,
*  it still could be a knock a walking ancestor.
*  You know, that gave rise to humans and Arte, but it just, all the stuff had disappeared by the time
*  you got to Arte. Anyway, that's kind of a counter argument that we can get more into that later.
*  I don't want to get too esoteric on you, but.
*  But it seems so fascinating that it has these really long arms,
*  but that there's no evidence whatsoever of not only knock a walking in that species,
*  but knock a walking as an ancestry.
*  Yeah. And that blew the mind of a lot of people. And there's a school of thought,
*  of critic out there sort of. Okay. So this thing was announced in 2009. It, you know,
*  surprised a lot of people. When was it discovered? When was it discovered?
*  Okay. It was discovered that the skeleton itself was discovered in 1994.
*  And how did they discover it? Well, I can short answer or long.
*  Long, long, long stretch it out. I like it. I want to hear the whole thing.
*  All right. Well, I'll take you back to the beginning of how like the whole detective
*  story was framed. And then if you want me to speed up, just.
*  No, no, no, no. This shows all about just letting you stick. I want you to have air.
*  Okay. So this group went to Ethiopia. They started doing this work in, first went on
*  an expedition Ethiopia in 1981. Specifically for this purpose of looking for ancient man.
*  I mean, they were looking for fossils and they're actually, I mean, they found this
*  fossil, but they found a lot of other stuff too, you know, and like all up and down the
*  timeline of human evolution. So some, some stuff that's like recent and like, you know,
*  in the order of hundreds of thousands of years ago, just stuff that's like six,
*  you know, getting near, you know, six million years ago, these fragments I was talking about
*  earlier. So they had their research agenda is as broad. It's just like, what can we find about
*  human evolution? But anyway, one of the big burning research questions at the time was
*  what came before Lucy? Now you've probably heard about Lucy. Lucy was discovered in Ethiopia in
*  1974. It was discovered by a guy named Don Johansson, an American guy with his assistant,
*  a guy named Tom Gray. They find this thing. It turns out to be a skeleton. It's 3.2 million
*  years old. It's probably, I think probably the best, it's fair to say it's the best known
*  human ancestor. I mean, people who know nothing else about human origins will at least recognize
*  the name Lucy. And there's a lot of reasons for that, you know, in terms of how it's publicized
*  and, and et cetera, et cetera. But I'm sorry to bother you for a second.
*  Wasn't Lucy also controversial? Yeah, it's, it's, any discovery in this field is controversial.
*  So these are, these are, yeah, these are people all, you know, having the great,
*  the identity politics, the paleo identity politics of humanity. So there is no, there is no easy
*  consensus in this field. So anyway, so Lucy is discovered. She's 3.2 million years old. I mean,
*  this is a huge revelation at the time because she was, you know, like already a skeleton.
*  And, you know, it took, you know, the oldest skeleton at that point was a Neanderthal,
*  which was less than a million years old. So this was like a big, big deal when they find something
*  this old. So anyway, you know, that thing is studied, there's popular books written about it,
*  et cetera, et cetera. From like the 1970s into the early 80s. That's the time when Lucy was sort of
*  being intensely studied and revealed to the world. Okay. So meanwhile, Ethiopia is going into this
*  period of turmoil. So this, this one of the big elements in this story is the difficulty of doing
*  this kind of work in a place like Ethiopia. So right around the time that Lucy was discovered,
*  the ancient monarchy of Ethiopia headed by the last emperor, Haley Selassie fell. It's like a
*  2000 year old monarchy, you know, it like traces its roots to biblical times, you know, and,
*  you know, claims to be the descendants of King Solomon and Queen Sheba, you know, I mean,
*  this ancient monarchy, but it hadn't really modernized. And then it was toppled by, you know,
*  student activists, the military, this whole kind of coalition that wanted to modernize Ethiopia.
*  Well, what happens is a, the power is seized by the military becomes a Marxist dictatorship.
*  Ethiopia, this longtime ally of the Americans in the Cold War shifts to the Soviet block.
*  And now it's like a frontier of the Cold War. Suddenly, like, you know, the Americans,
*  the Europeans who were kind of welcomed as foreign research before, and now viewed with hostility,
*  people are thinking, you know, you a CIA agent, you know, research kind of shuts down for a number
*  of years because it just becomes too dangerous. Meanwhile, there's like this tribal warfare
*  happening in the desert where they're doing this stuff. So it's, but finally in 1981,
*  things have calmed down enough that this research team is able to go back and they go back and they
*  have acquired a new project area. It's big. It's like the size of Rhode Island, you know,
*  and in that project area, there's all kinds of, it's like the layer cake of time, you know,
*  anthropology depends on geology. Okay. So there's like this layer cake time, you know, where you
*  have, you know, things are, you know, 1 million, 2 million years old. I mean, giving a really simple
*  model here. And this project area is really valuable because it's a sprawling area, but they
*  have all these different time periods exposed. So in other words, there's rocks from, you know,
*  a million years old, there's rocks that are more than, you know, as old as 6 million, all up and
*  down the timeline of human evolution. So these guys go there and they see this place and they say,
*  holy crap, this place is like, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like gold mine. It's a gold mine,
*  like spread out all over all of this place. I mean, you, and we can, we can learn so much about human
*  evolution if we just spend all these years studying, you know, things. So then unfortunately,
*  they spend one season here and just doing kind of reconnaissance to see what's there. Then Ethiopia
*  shuts down again. The government says, basically puts a halt to research. It says, you know,
*  they want to rewrite their antiquities laws so they can better control these foreigners who are
*  coming to look at this stuff. And they say, okay, well, hopefully we'll let you back next year.
*  Anyway, it takes, it takes nine years before they can resume research. So finally this team goes
*  back in 1990 and they're starting to, you know, go find things and learn more about this area,
*  you know, that they have in their project area. And finally in 1992,
*  they find a first tooth of what becomes the species of Ardipithecus.
*  Uh, at that point, at that point, they're not, they're not expecting to find a skeleton because
*  that's just like, that's like hoping you're going to win the lottery tomorrow. Right. You buy your
*  tickets. I, yeah, right. Yeah. I'm going to win the lottery. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Um, so, uh, they find
*  a tooth and then they start finding these pieces, um, and, you know, walking kilometers after
*  kilometers, you know, day after day, and then find, you know, a few more elements. And anyway,
*  over a couple of years, they collect enough to realize that this is a new species. Uh,
*  this is something different, but at this point it's just like a few teeth, you know, a few bone
*  fragments and stuff. But anyway, then in 1994, um, they find the skeleton and that's kind of an
*  interesting piece too, because it's kind of against all odds. And I can tell you how that
*  happened if you're interested. Yeah. I'd love to hear it. Yeah. So anyway, they're, they're,
*  they're walking along. Um, and, uh, I should introduce some of the characters here. So, um,
*  the characters sound like a movie by the way, the way everybody lays out.
*  Yeah. We haven't talked about that, that, that personality, but I'll, I'll mention, uh, some of
*  them. Okay. So, um, one of the guys who starts in 1981 is a young, uh, paleoanthropologist. His name
*  is Tim White. He is, uh, a anthropologist from the university of California, Berkeley. He's a guy
*  from the American West. He's a very hard charging, uh, um, strong willed guy. I mean, profane, um,
*  encyclopedic knowledge and everyone who works with him will tell you that he is probably
*  the most intense fossil hunter who they've ever, ever met. That's, that's Tim. He would be the star
*  of our movie. He'd be the Harrison Ford character. Yeah. But he would, he would, he would, he would
*  tell you that like, it's ridiculous to compare him to Harrison Ford because that's complete bullshit
*  because he is a, he is famously skeptical. He's a, he's a relentless killer of ideas. You know,
*  I mean, he's got this encyclopedic knowledge and he's got, you know, hair trigger bullshit detector.
*  And, uh, that's why a lot of people are afraid of him anyway, but he's also very, very exacting in
*  the field. And, um, and, you know, so when they realize that they're in such a dense, uh,
*  they're starting to pick up fossils, you know, he, he organizes people to basically crawl,
*  you know, hands and knees in these areas. He lays down like these lanes in the fossil rich areas,
*  either, you know, carve, you know, lines in the sand with his little walking stick, or he sometimes
*  will put down ropes, you know, and it's like, you know, Joe, your job is to walk shoulder to shoulder
*  next to, you know, whoever. And all 10 of you are just going to crawl this space, hands and knees,
*  and you're going to pick up every damn thing that you see, even if you think it's a rock, put it in
*  there, put it in the can, because we're not going to know for sure until we get back and look at it
*  more closely. And, and, and, and, and anyway, so, so he's one guy, uh, he, you know, there's a team
*  working underneath. Um, another character in this whole thing is, uh, one of Tim's former students,
*  a guy named Burhan Asfa, who's Ethiopian. And he, uh, I mean, there's an interesting back story with,
*  with Burhan. He had, you know, been a student in the time of the revolution and like a lot of other
*  students, he was swept up in the whole political reform movement. And like a lot of other students,
*  he was horrified to see what happened when the military dictatorship came in. He was arrested,
*  he was put in jail, he was tortured. He was lucky to survive. He told me he went into prison on a
*  chain gang with like seven other guys. And when he's released two years or excuse me, six months
*  later, there's only two guys alive. Um, this is a story of that generation. And, uh, and, and, you
*  know, the suffering that Ethiopia went through at that time is, uh, is, is astounding and most
*  Americans would find it hard to believe. But anyway, he's, he's a member of this, this group.
*  Uh, there's a number of other Ethiopian guys. Um, so part of the mission of this team has been,
*  you know, obviously to find fossils, but they sort of made it a dual mission to train Africans. Uh,
*  we can talk more about that later, but, uh, you know, if you look at a lot of the old,
*  you know, uh, documentaries about human origins, you see people, I mean, oftentimes they're like,
*  a lot of European people, you know, Americans and, and, and, you know, the Africa is the country of
*  human origins, but historically, at least for a long time, Africans were not,
*  they were hardly represented in the ranks of the scientists. Um, but anyway, so this team had made
*  part of their mission to train Ethiopians, not only to be, you know, field crew, but PhD
*  scientists and Brahani is one of those people. And another guy, uh, who actually found the first
*  piece of art, his name is Johannes Haley Selassie. He came, he was trained by Brahani and Tim. And
*  so, yeah, one of these days he's out there with this group of people and they're crawling across
*  and he finds a little bit of bone, like, uh, little hand bone. Second, uh, I think it was a
*  second metacarpal, it's a bone like right here in your hand and it's broken. And they say, great,
*  you know, we, we got a piece. And, uh, so, you know, and at first, you know, in this fossil,
*  the sandwich, everything's broken in, uh, you know, the isolated tooth here, the little bone
*  fragment there, you know, no one's expecting that if you find a piece like that, there's necessarily
*  going to be anything else from that skeleton that you find because the stuff is just scattered and,
*  you know, came from God, eroded out of God knows where. But anyway, a few days later,
*  they go back, they do the crawl again, they start finding more pieces and then more pieces. And then,
*  you know, they're sieving, which is basically like, you know, taking dirt and, uh, shaking it
*  through a screen and then, you know, seeing what's there. And there's of course a lot of rocks and
*  all kinds of crap, but they start finding some bones in there and then, you know, light bulb goes
*  off. Oh, there's multiple elements of a skeleton here or multiple elements of an individual. Okay.
*  But, you know, still it's kind of optimistic to think there may be a skeleton, but anyway,
*  then they're finding piece after piece. And then when you start finding multiple pieces, then
*  a kind of suspicion grows that there may, you may be close to the original, uh,
*  spot where the skeleton came out of the ground. So anyway, then I'll probably talk too long here.
*  So no, no, you're not, but can I stop you for a second? This is all, I'm assuming this is all
*  fossilized, right? Yeah. So this is, this is, yeah, this is fossil material. So basically what,
*  what a fossil is for people to know, it's just basically a bone that has turned to stone. So
*  when stuff, you know, sits in the ground for a long time, um, you know, the minerals kind of come in
*  and, and displace the original biological material. So, you know, you could have fossil,
*  you know, all kinds of fossil stuff. I mean, usually they're, they're bones.
*  Here's the question. How long do bones exist as bones before they become fossilized?
*  I actually don't know. That's a good question. Uh, and I, my guess is that it probably varies
*  a lot on the, uh, condition, you know, like just the geological condition. Uh, and so I,
*  I don't know, but my guess would be that that answer varies a lot depending on that sort of the,
*  the, uh, depositional environment. Like, you know, we're,
*  and so I can't give you a good answer. Jamie will find it. I'm sure. But so another question is when,
*  is it always that bones become fossilized or is it very specific conditions? Like do bones for the
*  most part just deteriorate and be eaten by, you know, parasites and the environment and
*  bugs and whatnot? Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's pretty rare to be lucky enough to find something like
*  this. And okay. So in that part of Africa, there are a lot of predators, you know, and there's
*  hyena. I mean, now and then, you know, cause they, they find like, you know, along with these fossils
*  of things like already, they also find like, you know, ancient hyenas, ancient big cats, you know,
*  all these things that were like, you know, eating our, our ancestors, you know, so, uh, and like a
*  lot of these fossils, you know, have like tooth marks in them and stuff. So, so, so, you know,
*  something dies, a carcass lands on the ground, you know, boom. And, you know, it's probably consumed
*  by, you know, some big cat or whatever, or, I mean, one of the really ravaging things are hyenas,
*  you know, they come in and packs and they have these really powerful jaws and they can actually
*  chew bones down to splinters, you know? And so, uh, you know, now, you know, something dies. I mean,
*  after a couple of days, there could just be like splinters left. So it's not like they just kind
*  of clean off the skeleton for it. So anyway, they, they come in and then there's all this,
*  like this whole kind of like chain of other scavengers that move in. I mean, there's a
*  lot of ancient pigs and believe it or not, I mean, you may think of like nice little pig as being,
*  you know, this cute barnyard animal, but actually pigs are, uh, surprisingly annihilative scavengers.
*  I mean, you sometimes-
*  They're ruthless. They're ruthless. We have an answer for you. Um, fossilize, uh, preserve remains
*  become fossils if they reach an age of about 10,000 years. Okay. So it's 10,000 years, which is not
*  that long at all.
*  It comes off, it comes off the internet. So we know it's, we know it's true.
*  Right. So what is the, uh, the source-
*  Nationalgeographic.org I went to for that.
*  So National Geographic, it's a good source.
*  Yeah. So it's, it's, uh, it's a long time.
*  But yeah. So back to wild pigs. Yeah. Wild pigs. Well, that was famously a scene in the movie
*  Snatch, right? You remember that movie? Um, the Brad Pitt movie. It's a great, uh, Guy Richie,
*  uh, crime movie. The guy keeps pigs because pigs will eat everything. They eat the bones,
*  they eat everything. So when he gets rid of, when he murders people, he throws them in the pen with
*  the pigs and the pigs eat every part of the body.
*  Yeah. Well, exactly. So there's pigs and then there's, you know, like, uh, porcupines,
*  it's like, you know, little, little, you know, rodents that come in. So dung beetles. I mean,
*  so by the time, this is like going down through this whole thing. So, uh, by the time
*  there's nothing left to eat, there's not much left of this, the skeleton. And, uh, so anyway, um,
*  so that's, that's just preserving the bones. Now there's another thing that has to happen for
*  the endophosph, you know, it has to like be in a depositional environment that will encourage
*  the bone to fossilize and not just degrade, you know, and, you know, there's different places
*  that are conducive to that. I mean, one is like a place where there's like a lake or something,
*  you know, covering it with sediment. And, uh, this particular place they think was probably an ancient
*  floodplain. So somewhere near a river where there'd be like overbank flooding every now and then,
*  it would like put on these layers of silt over time. And then the stuff would just be buried in
*  the silt and then it would, would fossilize. But anyway, to answer your question, so, you know,
*  you could have like a herd of antelope or whatever, you know, a hundred antelope and, you know, they'd
*  all meet their ends in various ways, but you know, none of them could actually be fossilized in the
*  end, you know, so it's pretty, it's there. It's a pretty small minority of things that, um, that
*  have the courtesy to leave their bones for us. And then, so that's, that's one element that makes this
*  thing so hard. And then the other one is just, you know, you have to be, if, if you are the fossil
*  hunter, you know, the paleontologist, you have to come along at the right time when that fossil is,
*  uh, coming out of the ground, you know, so basically the stuff gets buried, you know, uh, you
*  know, in our, in our layer cake and, and, you know, it, uh, you know, other layers stack up and then
*  fossilize it, but then, you know, they come to the surface again, usually by geological faulting,
*  you know, like the, or erosion. And once the stuff comes to the surface, uh, some, some fossils are
*  like rock in the last, you know, for long, long, long, long time, but other stuff like this
*  particular skeleton are actually really chalky. And, uh, I mean, Tim White, the, the, the, the fellow
*  who was, um, sort of guiding this whole, this whole operation, uh, says that, you know, that
*  it's, you know, it was so brittle, he could like come apart in your hands if you didn't handle it
*  right. So they just happened to have the good fortune to kind of show up in this spot when it
*  was coming out of the ground just enough to be found, but it hadn't been on the surface for long
*  enough to sort of be degraded and stopped on by, stopped on by animals and, and, you know, blown
*  around, you know, cause once the stuff comes to the surface, it doesn't, it's on a slope, right?
*  So that, and they get these torrential, it's, it's, it's a desert. So don't get a lot of rain,
*  but when they do get rains, they can be torrential and then that just sends, you know, everything
*  downstream. So they just hit the Goldilocks zone. They just have happened to be there at the right
*  time. Yeah. And, and, you know, some of that is luck, but it's also, you know, you, you make your
*  own luck. It's, it's, it's, it's putting yourself in the position to find things, you know, to spot
*  them if they're on the ground and then to do the detective work to sort of, um, find the original
*  resting place. Like, so, so Tim White, this guy mentioned, he's the, uh, uh, the, uh, paleo
*  anthropologist. He, you know, when they, when they found this scatter of stuff on the ground,
*  the question is where, where'd it come from? Where's the original in situ site, which is kind
*  of what I left off when I was telling you that story a minute ago, because they're founding all
*  these things on the ground. So they're planting flags to mark where each one came from and they
*  see a pattern, you know, converging, getting narrower and narrower on this, this little
*  hillock. And, uh, you know, Tim compares it to, um, uh, you know, what the gold miners did in
*  California. He's, he's from California, you know, the 49ers where you sort of like see what the
*  pattern is and then sort of follow it up slope to the source. And that's what they did. And then
*  they start, they start to dig, dig in there. They found, um, some bones that were still
*  embedded in the original sediments. That tells you like, okay, now we found the,
*  you know, the original resting spot of this thing. And that's when they start digging and that's,
*  you know, I mean, it's very, it's a very slow process. I mean, it doesn't happen nearly as
*  fast. I mean, this stretches over days and weeks, but anyway, they start digging there.
*  And this is when they say, holy crap, this is like a skeleton. So between finding the initial
*  bone in 94 to actually pulling it out of the ground in a skeleton form, how much time is
*  this taking? Uh, okay. So I think they found the first piece of the skeleton in, uh, I think it
*  was sometime in November 94. Uh, and then meanwhile, there's, there's all kinds of stuff going on. So
*  there's certain, they're doing surveys elsewhere because I, as I mentioned before this particular
*  project, they've got, uh, stuff, sediments of all kinds of ages and it's huge. And so, you know,
*  they've got a lot of places to look and you don't know. Uh, so they're not going to start,
*  if you're in this line of work, you don't start digging until you have a pretty good reason to
*  believe there's something there because otherwise you're just going to waste your time and you don't
*  have much time in the field. You know, you got to, you know, pay to sustain these expeditions in the
*  desert. There's, you know, there's, uh, people running around with guns. I mean, we haven't
*  talked about this, but there's like this tribal, like literally tribal warfare going on there. And,
*  and so, um, so you don't, you don't waste your time digging unless you have a pretty good reason
*  to believe that there's something there. So anyway, uh, they find this first piece in November and
*  then I think, you know, they come back some days later and then start finding these other pieces
*  that I mentioned. And then, uh, then, you know, some weeks, it was some weeks later before they
*  started digging. Um, some of that was, uh, waiting until the, there was enough evidence to, to really
*  strongly indicate that there was something there. And some of that was just juggling the
*  conflicting priorities in the field. Um, and what, one of those conflicting priorities is actually
*  they were searching for another, what they hoped would be another skeleton quite close to this one,
*  just, um, maybe a couple hundred meters away because they'd found, you know, a nice arm bone
*  there the year before and then dug this hole and dug and dug and dug and they dug for years there,
*  but never found any more of that creature. So that's, that's kind of an example of,
*  you know, what is not an unusual experience, but you got to hear hopes that you dig and then
*  dang it, there's nothing there. But in this case, there was something there and it was a lot there.
*  So, uh, yeah, go ahead. Was there skepticism that it was all from the same individual?
*  Uh, yeah, well that's, that is of course unclear when you're starting to dig, you know, um,
*  but, you know, I think over the days and weeks as they were, you know, slowly pulling
*  pieces out of this, uh, excavation site, um, which is a very slow process. I mean, they're,
*  they're, I mean, literally working with like, um, dental tools, you know, I mean, there's a lot of
*  pictures of Tim there and, you know, chipping away at this and his students, you know, they're,
*  they're using, um, like brushes, you know, to brush because you don't want to go in there with
*  a trowel because you're going to, you know, destroy something. So over the days and weeks,
*  they discover there's no duplication of parts, which is a strong indication that it might be,
*  excuse me, one individual. Now, can I stop you again? Are they filming all this so that they
*  can like, so that if there are skeptics, cause with anthropologists and paleontologists, there
*  are a lot of skeptics, right? So are they preparing for this and filming every step of the way?
*  Uh, not every step of the way, but, uh, Tim White is a relentless record keeper. Uh, and he has this
*  humanist photo archive, uh, for one, he's also a relentless record keeper and he, you know,
*  when the excavation started, they actually, yeah, as you said, they did set up a video camera on a
*  tripod and train it on the excavation era and just let it roll. And this is, you know, back in the
*  days of, uh, you know, tick, tick. Yeah. I don't know if it's VSS or like micro something, but
*  anyway, so they're, they're filming all this stuff. So by the time I come along, you know, many,
*  almost 20 years later, uh, Tim lets me see all this stuff. And to me, this was like an absolute
*  goldmine because I, you know, this thing that I would normally have to reconstruct, you know,
*  after the fact, which, you know, I wouldn't be able to see the conversations that people told me
*  what they said. I'd have to greet that with some skepticism because how reliable was this person's
*  memory after 20 years? I mean, I couldn't really be there in any way, but now that I have this
*  videotape, I'm watching while these guys are digging up these little pieces. I'm watching while Tim
*  is, you know, exposing this smile of this ancient, you know, this ancient member of the,
*  of the human family and, uh, hours and hours of this stuff. So I can actually hear,
*  you know, the excitement and then all the other kind of cross talk, the jokes, you know, the fact
*  that they're playing the Grateful Dead in the background or Bob Marm or listing the BBC, you
*  know, all this stuff, you know, it's so, uh, to me, you know, as, as a reporter, uh, that was,
*  that was like the equivalent of them finding the skeleton for me, having this trove of records
*  was, uh, just, just such an astounding jackpot for me because it let me be there.
*  Yeah, that's amazing. So how many teeth were intact? Did it have a full smile?
*  Uh, the teeth, well, they were, they were in the jawbone. I don't remember. I shouldn't give you
*  a number because I don't, I don't remember, but they pretty much got most teeth of this creature.
*  I don't know, maybe not on this one individual, but there are, while this operation went on for
*  years and over the years, they collected a lot of fragments from other individuals. So I'm sure they,
*  they have pretty much all the teeth are pretty close to all the teeth. I mean, the number of
*  teeth they have is, um, uh, it's, I'm, it's, it's in the book somewhere and I don't remember the
*  number, but it's, it's well over a hundred. So with Artie in the skeleton, there is this,
*  is this the only example of this particular member of this, this, the, you know, this
*  evolution, this period in evolution or are there other of the similar timeframe that they found?
*  Other individuals or other species, other individuals. Yeah. So there's, there's a lot of,
*  uh, of individuals and of the species, but you know, again, they're just, uh, they're not,
*  they're not, uh, they're not complete. Yeah. And obviously, you know, they find like a, you know,
*  uh, a part of a jaw bone of another individual, actually they found a nice jaw or part of a jaw,
*  uh, just like a stone's throw away from where Artie was found. Um, they found like a foot bone of a,
*  of a bigger member. Are they kind of jokingly nicknamed big foot? And they're aging these,
*  they're aging these creatures based on the biological material that's around it.
*  Yeah. Well, this is, this is interesting. And this, this, if you read the book, this becomes
*  part of the sort of scientific detective story is all the techniques that are, that are,
*  that are used. And for me as a reporter, this was actually part of the, the origins of this story
*  was getting to learn about all these components sciences that go into paleoanthropology. And
*  there, there are a lot of them. It's definitely a multidisciplinary field, but one of the most
*  important, uh, uh, uh, disciplines, sub-disciplines within this is geology. And the reason is that
*  geology gives you the timeline to answer the question that you just, that you just asked.
*  And so there's different methods of dating. I mean, you can sort of, if you're in the field,
*  you can begin to make estimates about the age of the sediments based on the other animals that are
*  there. Like, if you know, if you find a certain type of pig that, you know, this particular species
*  of pig between live between this date and that state. So that kind of narrows it down. Um,
*  so they call that bio chronology. So that's one, but the real specific method of dating is, uh,
*  dating the volcanic ashes and lovats. And I can do, I can give you like a one minute tutorial on
*  that. Okay. So as I meant, so, so basically, uh, uh, you could think, think of geology as like a
*  layer cake, right? So let's just say like, here, the ancient layers that were laid down, like I
*  was describing, let's just say this one is a million years old. This one's 2 million. This one's three.
*  This one's four. Okay. So how do you know how old things are? Well, the main method of dating is
*  called radiometric dating. And so that basically means that they find volcanic ashes and lovats
*  that are, cause this is on the edge. The great Raffaelli, there's like tons of volcanoes all
*  up and down Eastern Africa. And every once in a while they erupt and they spew out, you know,
*  ashes and lovats and the stuff settles on the ground. And some, in some cases, I mean, these,
*  these ash layers are really thick. I mean, like several feet thick. And you think, oh my God,
*  what a apocalyptic eruption, eruption that must've been when that happened. But anyway,
*  it's great for the geologists because they can take these ashes and they take them into the lab.
*  And then they can tell, um, uh, basically by the, uh, it's called isotopic dating. And so basically
*  it's just, there's a, you know, a change in the isotopes of, of, um, of potassium in particular,
*  and argon, which are components here. And, uh, this stuff decays at a constant rate, which is
*  not affected by temperature or pressure if it's in the earth or whatever, it's just a constant
*  rate. So this gives you a yardstick to measure, uh, how old something is. So they can't, uh,
*  figure out the age of the individual bones, but you can figure out the layers of the ashes and
*  lovats that are above it and below it. And that gives you a bracket. And, uh, you know, and then
*  there's like, like literally hundreds of ash and, um, uh, lava layers in this area. And so in all
*  of these things are, you know, been dated over the years, that gives you a timeline. So with this
*  particular skeleton, there's very conveniently an ash, uh, in the layer above it and another one
*  below it. And when they did the dating, they both were calculated to be 4.4 million years old.
*  So that means, you know, I mean that, that the area between them was deposited in a pretty
*  short period of time. I mean, you know, the, this method dating doesn't give you a down to like the
*  year or even, you know, tens of years. So no one knows like just how long that period of time was,
*  but it's probably on the order of, you know, maybe a hundred years, something in the hundreds of
*  years, not, not long. And, you know, and for something of this age, that's actually really
*  precise dating. So, so to answer your question, uh, it's, it's using volcanic ashes and lavas
*  above and below it to figure out the date of things. And what is the, the window of possibility?
*  Like how, how tightly can they narrow that down within a million years? Like what?
*  Uh, well, I think it probably depends on the, you know, I'm not a geologist, so I don't want to speak
*  beyond my layer of knowledge here, but, um, with this one, they brought it down to 4.4. So I think,
*  you know, that's pretty, that's pretty tight. There's certainly, there's certainly a margin,
*  you know, of, of, of uncertainty, a margin of error in there that they reported. And it's some
*  long number with a lot of decimal points, which I don't remember, but yeah, long story short,
*  that 4.4 is a pretty, it's a pretty good, it's a pretty good date. And for, for this stuff of this
*  age, it's, it's, it's, uh, it's quite solid. Now, when you have a being like this, that's so
*  unusual. It's not like anything they've encountered before with the longer legs and the thumbs on the
*  feet and the whole deal. When they're piecing this together, like how do they know exactly where
*  everything goes? How, how are they absolutely sure how to put this together when they're putting it
*  together and they're realizing that this is so different than what they expected for something
*  of this age? What, how much of a freak out is happening here? Well, okay. So it's, it's different
*  in some important parts, but, but then again, if you're an expert on skeletons, like these guys
*  are, it's, it's, it's different than what they've seen, but I mean, they know how skeletons go
*  together and you know, I mean, they can tell what's, yeah, you don't get a fever confused with,
*  with like, you know, a thumb phalanx, you know? So, you know, they look at this and, and, and,
*  you know, I don't have this knowledge, but certainly those people do that they can pick up a tooth and
*  they'll say, oh yeah, this is, you know, upper right side of the mouth. I mean, the people that
*  know skeletons can do all this mental rotation in their head and they can often do it from fragments
*  of bone. So it's not the whole tooth, but like a fraction of a tooth or a fraction of, you know,
*  some foot bone. And, you know, to me, that was actually one of the fascinating things about this
*  is like how these people that know their skeletons can read the revelations in this,
*  this, in the skeletons. Do you know the story of Gigantopithecus, how they discovered that?
*  No. It was an apothecary shop in China. There was an anthropologist who found, I believe he found a
*  tooth and he was like, what the hell is this? And he realized it was a primate tooth, but it was much
*  larger than anything they'd ever seen before. And then he asked them to, I think this is, I want to
*  say 1920s or 1930s. And then they, I mean, I don't think they've gotten anything more than some jaw
*  bones and teeth. And they realized it's a bipedal hominid that was somewhere in the neighborhood of
*  eight feet tall. It wouldn't have been a hominid if it was, so a hominid, at least in the old
*  meaning, the meaning has changed, but means like member of the human family, which was basically
*  after our split from the chimps. So now they call them hominines with an I N at the end. So,
*  so I, what do you call it? Gigantopithecus, I believe is a, a myosin ape. So it's an ape,
*  it's a primate, but you wouldn't consider it a member of the human family. It's just one of
*  many weird things from the, this period they called the myosin.
*  I fucked the terminology up, but the point I was getting at that they,
*  just from looking at a jaw bone, they can figure out what this thing was and how tall it was is
*  bonkers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because the body proportions are, I mean, they vary somewhat,
*  but you can tell a lot from, you know, sometimes individual bone, you know, I mean, like,
*  believe it or not, like the head of the femur is often used as kind of a, so, you know, the ball
*  bone socket on your, on your, on your thigh bone is often, you know, used, was used in
*  artifice in fact, to scale different parts. So they, they've got this complete skeleton.
*  There's, there's nothing missing from Artie. Well, there are some things missing. Yeah. So
*  I mean, it's, it's, it's relatively, I mean, by the standards of paleoanthropology,
*  it's remarkably complete and actually the hands and the feet, which usually you don't get like
*  Tim White, the paleoanthropologist, he calls them, you know, carnivore or Durs, because, you know,
*  you're lying, your carcass is there and like, you know, the pack of hiatus comes in and like,
*  you know, here's a handout for, you know, the carnivore, they chew off your feet and whatever.
*  So, so it's, it's remarkably complete, but there are some pieces missing and there are some pieces
*  that are just present, but really damaged. Like most of the spine is not there and it sure would
*  be nice to have the spine because you can tell a lot about the kind of the design of the creature,
*  the organization of the creature, if you know how its spinal segments are divided, you know,
*  the pelvis they have a lot of, but it's pretty distorted by geology. So anyway, there's, there's
*  and some of the limb bones are fragmentary. So for example, they don't have a knee joint,
*  which was sure would be nice to have because you could, that's like an interesting bit of data
*  to figure out just how, how this creature was a biped. So anyway, so there are, there are certainly
*  pieces missing and I'm sure that, you know, science would love, love to have them.
*  Is already on display? Is there, or at least online, is there a place to view it?
*  No, well, there are some photographs of it that, you know, that have been published and you can see
*  it. So do they lay it out on a table in the form that they think that it came in? Yeah, I mean,
*  and the form that's the, to reconstruct these, the skeletal elements is, is not terribly
*  hard for these guys to do. I think in one case there might've been a question about one of the
*  hand bones, you know, like there was like a phalanx of one of the fingers and there was a
*  question, did it go in this finger or another finger? But, but for the most part, the, it's
*  easy for these experts to know where an element goes in, in the skeleton. So there's pictures of,
*  of the skeleton, you know, laid out, you know, not long after discovery, not, not in the field,
*  but in the lab. There's other parts took a long time, like the skull. I mean, that took
*  more than 10 years to put that together. Yeah. So the skull came in several fragments, obviously.
*  Yeah. So it looks, you could, some of the pictures were published of it, but like,
*  when it came out of the ground, I think it had been like, kind of like pounded down, you know,
*  just by the force of biology. So it was, you know, like, like if you took a pile driver,
*  just whap, you know, and, you know, pounded the thing down. And so, you know, that was
*  quite fragmentary. And so they had to reconstruct it. It was reconstructed by a,
*  a scientist from Japan named Gen Tsuwa. Jamie put an image of it up on the screen right now.
*  We're taking a look at it right now. It's fascinating. So it shows like, basically like
*  half of it was intact or somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of it up, up at the top
*  of the left side of the head. It's amazing. Yeah. I mean, it's really cool what you can do. So this
*  guy who reconstructed that, his name is Gen Tsuwa. He's from the university of Tokyo museum and he's,
*  he's, you know, very exacting scientist. I haven't met him personally, but I've met a lot of people
*  who work with him and they, he's a very unassuming guy, but he kind of leaves all of his colleagues
*  in awe because of his acumen. Anyway, he reconstructed that with his team. This is incredible.
*  So it's, it's actually, I said it the wrong way. It's left. I'm viewing the left side. It's actually
*  the right side that was reconstructed, but the left side is the actual skull itself, which is
*  a bunch of pieces, but the teeth are remarkably intact. And that was the other part that was
*  fascinating to me was that it doesn't have canines like a chimp. It has them more like a human being.
*  Yeah. And that actually, that was one of the big, well, number, number one, that's one of the
*  indicators, the strong indicators that tells us that this is something in somewhere in the human
*  lineage. Number one, cause we have, you know, as, as you mentioned canines that are different than
*  most other apes, you know, the other, most other primates have these interlocking canines, you know,
*  I mean like chimps and gorillas are two closest cousins both to do that, you know, the big fangs
*  right. And they sharpen themselves, you know, by rubbing against the pre-mold, the canine rubs
*  against the premolar. So it's kind of like always keeping your knife sharp, right? But humans are
*  unique because we have these things that are not these dag like fangs, you know, they are diamond
*  shaped. So already these canines are certainly bigger than yours or mine or later members of the
*  human family. But it shows that this, what they call canine reduction was already well underway
*  by the time Artie lived. And actually this is an important point because the teeth, you know,
*  the canines in particular are kind of a diagnostic feature of these early members of the human family,
*  because when you get back in time, the things that the clues that, that tell you that this is
*  a member of the human family, they become much more subtle because these creatures get more and
*  more ape like and less and less human like as you go back in time. So canines are a sort of reliable
*  way or let's say a reliable indicator to tell you that you're, you're looking at some bit of early
*  humanity here. Does it tell us anything about Artie's diet? Because, or is it a defensive thing?
*  Because like when we're looking at gorillas, gorillas are, they have canines, but they're
*  vegetarians and their canines are for defense, right? Right, right. I mean, yeah, this is
*  interesting. So if you're a gorilla, I mean, you know, they spend a lot of time eating like
*  leaves and stuff and, and, you know, you don't eat these big canines to like take out a, you know,
*  so this is, you know, the sort of predominant interpretation is that this is a
*  sign of interest species aggression. Because, you know, with gorillas, for example, they,
*  they, they, their mating structure is that there's like, you know, a big alpha male, like,
*  let's call him a silverback. And he kind of lords over this harem of females and tends to sire the
*  kids, you know, and, and, you know, every, and then these bachelor males that will sometimes
*  challenge, you know, alpha male and try to take him out. So, you know, so natural selection would
*  for the case of gorillas would favor these big sharp canines and then these big brute bodies,
*  like male gorillas are quite big, in some cases, like twice as big as the females. And this is all
*  interpreted as like inter inter species aggression for mating. Now, humans are interesting because
*  we don't have these big canines. And actually, this factors into the story because one of the
*  main investigators and evolutionary theorists on who interpreted already was a fellow named Owen
*  Lovejoy. And he's from Kent State University in the United States. And he has a theory that
*  what you're looking at with canine reduction is a social revolution that this is monogamy happening
*  basically that instead of, you know, some gorilla like mating structure, you know, where you have like
*  just, you know, the gorilla, you know, instead of like the harem or a mating structure like chimps
*  or bonobos, which are more promiscuous, but certainly not starting to not monogamous.
*  But he thinks that the canine reduction we see in the human lineage is because there was pair bonding
*  and that the reduction in canines is a sign of reduced aggression in our species. And this was,
*  he believes, like one of the early human major adaptations that sent us on our own way.
*  That's got to be a very controversial theory, isn't it? Because there's a lot of paleontologists
*  that think that even with human beings, there's a lot of people that think that human beings
*  weren't really monogamous until they figured out whose kids there were.
*  Right? Well, it's hugely controversial for a whole number of reasons. But one thing I should
*  clarify is what the biologists mean about monogamy. So it's wrong to kind of understand that in kind
*  of like our modern, moralistic way. This is not like, you know, the American Family Council talking
*  here about monogamy. This is monogamy in the way that like, so there's a lot of examples of creatures
*  that do have, that are monogamous, like birds, you know, thinking like, you know, mom and dad
*  in the nest. Or, you know, I think coyotes are. I mean, there's, or gibbons is another
*  or another primate that are monogamous. So this is not unusual in the world of biology. Yeah. So
*  anyway, so sometimes people say, oh, you know, that's, you know, it's, you know, that's kind of like,
*  you know, bringing in some of this moralistic, it's not that it's, it's, it's, it is a legitimate,
*  you know, way to describe a baiting strategy that exists in many places in nature. Okay. So
*  and there's other theories that have, you know, ascribed human sexuality to something, you know,
*  to something more like a chimp, you know, that it's, you know, promiscuous and, you know,
*  and especially, I mean, as the book mentions that, you know, the, this whole model of a chimp-like
*  ancestor has been, you know, prevalent in anthropology for decades. And, you know, and
*  one subcategory there is mating strategy. And, you know, there's, you know, if you're, I mean,
*  if everyone amuses yourself, read about, you know, just, you know, sort of theories about,
*  you know, human mating strategies. I mean, there's all kinds of, of, of, of ways that people have
*  explained our, our peculiarities and our, yeah, our sexuality and all that stuff. Now, we're
*  looking at already, we're talking about an animal that predates weapons, correct?
*  Yeah, as far as we know. So the first stone tools do not appear until, well, certainly by around
*  two and a half, 2.6 million years ago, there's stone tools. There's some things that have been
*  found in Kenya that are older, that are like 3.2 or 3.3. That, that one is a little controversial,
*  so we'll see how that all shakes out. But, but anyway, but in either case, it's, at least the
*  stone tools are way after already way after Lucy. So it's possible they use weapons, sticks and
*  things along those lines. Yeah. So that's, that's the part we may never know because if there's
*  something like a stick that biodegrades, then, you know, who knows or throwing a rock, right?
*  You know, you could, you could, you could, you know, how do we know that the idea would be that
*  they're not hunting with weapons? Most likely? No, and actually, surprisingly, weapons are
*  arrived pretty late in human origins. I, I, I, the figures in the book, and I don't want to say it
*  now because I don't remember what it is offhand, but the early tools are things like, you know,
*  choppers and then hand axes, but those are tools for processing food. You know, they're not, I mean,
*  the weapons come late. It's kind of interesting that, you know, this, the things that are
*  identifiable weapons are like spears and adiladals and stuff like that. Yeah. Or, or like, or, you
*  know, particularly like lithic things, you know, that leave a, excuse me, leave a, you know,
*  that are, that are stone that are preserved. Those, those, those come pretty late. It's an
*  interesting question about just why weapons were developed and why, why we started using them.
*  So do we know, do we have speculation as to what Artie's diet was? Like was Artie an herbivore?
*  Yeah. So they can, they can make some determinations based on a couple of lines of evidence.
*  One is the Microsoft microscopic striations in the teeth. Cause when you eat something, you know,
*  you're, whatever you eat leaves kind of like a scratches on the surface of the dental material.
*  So they can make some inferences there. Another one is using, this gets kind of complicated, but
*  they can make some inferences about what kind of plant foods they ate based on, there's, there's
*  two kinds of plants like C3 or C4. And this refers to like two different forms of photosynthesis.
*  C4 plants tend to be more like open, sunny sort of thing. C3 plants tend to be, you know, more
*  shady things. I mean, this is not an absolute difference, but it's, it's an important one.
*  But anyway, so they can make some inferences there that Artie's diet was mostly like C3 things,
*  which tends to be things that are in more kind of wooded areas, you know, not the open,
*  you know, food of the grasslands and that sort of thing. I mean, it did have some C4 in its diet,
*  but it's mostly C3. But so mostly vegetables, is this what's believed or is it inferred that
*  it's omnivorous? Yeah, they think it's probably omnivorous. I've heard some speculation that maybe
*  if they are maybe eating some bugs and, you know, yeah, stuff like that. I mean, the interesting
*  thing is like you can, you can get the C3 or C4 signature from eating the plant, which is
*  directly, but you can also get it if you eat another animal that's been eating one of those
*  two things. So this kind of moves up through the food chain. Is there speculation as to like what
*  natural selection benefit there would be for it to stand up? Like for it to be upright? Yeah. So
*  this actually gets back to that monogamy theory I was telling you about, which is, you know,
*  admittedly quite controversial. But so what Owen Lovejoy theorizes, and this was presented when
*  with the announcement, the series of papers when already was finally revealed to the world in 2009.
*  Owen's theory is that it's monogamy is a mating strategy and that basically,
*  let's go back to your question. So you're interested in like what they're speculating or
*  answering the question, why is this creature erect? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So Owen's, this is kind
*  of interesting take on the whole question. So this of course, you know, why did humans stand
*  upright is the million dollar question of human origins. I mean, Darwin tried to answer it, you
*  know, and many, many people have tried to answer it. There's more theories than you can shake a
*  stick at, you know, I mean, Darwin said, okay, you know, people stood up because they were using
*  tools, you know, to free the hands and other people that said, no, it's because they were,
*  you know, trying to minimize sun exposure because they were standing up, you know, in the hot place,
*  you're getting less sun than if you're, you know, like that. I mean, people have said it's phallic
*  display, I mean, all kinds of stuff, you know, picking fruit, seeing over tall grass, I mean,
*  you name it, right. But the interesting thing is that most of these theories look for like a direct
*  benefit for standing up to some direct evolutionary benefit. Owen's theory is a little different
*  because he doesn't think there is a direct benefit. He thinks it's sort of a secondary thing.
*  So just to tell you a little bit more about Owen, he's kind of an interesting
*  guy, he has an interesting history, but he, earlier in his career, he specialized in biomechanics,
*  and actually he was the main biomechanical analyst on the Lucy team and like 20 years before Artie
*  came along. But anyway, his early career, he worked with scientists who designed artificial joints.
*  And so he grew up, you know, grew up as a scientist with a pretty keen awareness of how
*  biomechanics worked and also what could go wrong with the skeleton. And Owen will tell you that
*  that bipedality is a really stupid thing to do from an evolutionary perspective because it makes
*  you slow. I mean, you know, slow and, you know, if you want to be a fast runner, you probably should
*  stay on all fours, you know, it, you know, it's an invitation for disaster, you know, because, you
*  know, I mean, why do we have artificial joints? It's because people blow out knees or blow out hips
*  and, you know, standing upright also causes these vulnerabilities in your back, you know, for
*  because of the way the spine is kind of contorted and with humans. So why on earth would this species
*  do this stupid thing? You know, and why are there a billion of us here now, you know, you know,
*  if we did this stupid thing? So Owen's theory is that it was actually a sacrifice in locomotion,
*  but what it did do is it gave us this big payoff in reproduction. So he thinks the standing erect
*  was to free the hands that within the context of these monogamous relationships, I was telling you
*  before, so that the males, you know, guys like you and me became provisioners. So they basically
*  became the males became partners in the child rearing and this increased survivorship. So it's
*  an interesting thing that other apes, you know, are not very, not very involved dads, you know,
*  they become dead, you know, I call them deadbeat dads, you know, they were and so, but humans are
*  unusual. We have these monogamous relationships. So anyway, Owen's theory is that the bipedality
*  was just a means to an end. It allowed the males to provision and that the, you know, females would
*  be able to spend more time, you know, nurturing, you know, you know, children and this was a
*  demographic revolution. And so, and then the reduction in canines is part of that theory
*  and that this was like a reduction in aggression. So we're not fighting over, you know, who's the
*  alpha male were in these monogamous pairs within a troop of primates. And that explains why, you know,
*  bipedality appears pretty early in human evolution and why they reduce canines also appears.
*  Is there, I'm sorry, this is Owen's theory. It's, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's quite controversial.
*  And, you know, it's, it's, you know, without finding things that even if you were able to find,
*  you know, skeletons, right, you know, older than already, it would still be controversial. But
*  anyway, that's, that's the theory. Is there a compelling competing theory?
*  There are lots of competing theories, probably too many to mention here. I mean, I mentioned some,
*  you know, standing ups to see over...
*  The phallic display.
*  You'll hear much about that one anymore, but that one's hilarious.
*  Yeah, shortly after the sexual revolution, that one appeared and it just...
*  That's hilarious. So we don't know, basically.
*  We don't know. And then, I mean, some of this stuff, I mean, to be honest, I mean, from my
*  point of view is, is, may ultimately be unknowable.
*  Does the fact that Artie was basically intact despite being around predators and scavengers
*  and all these different things, and the fact that Artie was walking on hind legs, despite the fact
*  that walking on hind legs makes you more vulnerable, does this signify that it was
*  in some sort of a protected environment or it wasn't at such risk of predation?
*  Well, remember, these things can go, you know, in terms of escaping predators.
*  Trees.
*  Yeah, I mean, it can go up a tree and I'm not, you know, between you and me, I don't have an
*  opposable toe, but if I were out on, you know, out in some dangerous place in Africa when the sun is
*  going down and, you know, the hyenas were coming out, I would be probably heading up a tree too.
*  And I would recommend you do the same. But, you know, you're forced to still have to worry
*  about the big cats. But anyway, so it did have the ability to go into the trees. But yeah,
*  how did these things survive? That's an interesting question. You know, I mean,
*  there are other animals that, you know, monkeys that live there that have the same,
*  you know, the same challenge today. But actually, I'll tell you,
*  just a little interesting aside here and sort of the field work part of the detective story.
*  So the fact that they found the skeleton that was remarkably complete
*  was all the more miraculous because of the condition of all the other stuff they were
*  finding until that point. So Tim White, the main paleoanthropologist on the team, he,
*  you know, he's very experienced and has been working in Africa for a long time. And when
*  he looked at the fossil assemblage, you know, the word that he used, it was ravaged. And this was
*  visible to him, you know, from, you know, from their first days on the site, because they're
*  finding all these fragments of things that have clearly been chewed apart. And instead of finding
*  teeth, they're finding pieces of teeth and like bones that are chewed to splinters. In some cases,
*  they actually found things that are etched by digestive acid. So basically what that means is
*  that, you know, it was eaten by some carnivore, you know, passed through the objective track and
*  shit out, you know, left in some pile, you know, that then, you know, degrades, but the tooth is
*  still there. But they can see they like the surface has this, you know, kind of altered
*  texture to it that tells these people that yeah, that's digestive acid at work on this thing.
*  So, you know, because that was like the signature of all this fossil assemblage that they were
*  seeing, you know, if you're just getting like teeth and like, you know, things that have been,
*  you know, passed through the objective track for carnivore and splinters, you know, you're not going
*  to, you're not hoping for a skeleton, you're not going to find a skeleton here, but somehow by,
*  you know, just by great luck, they did for some reason, this carcass wound up on the ground
*  was not, you know, demolished by all these predators and had a chance to fossilize. So that
*  that is just remarkably good fortune. Was that one of the reasons why it was treated with so much
*  skepticism?
*  Because, well, I mean, no one doubts the existence of the skeleton. At least, you know, no one should
*  What do they doubt? Since well, they doubt. I'm sorry, but there's so many things that are so
*  specific, like the carbon dating of the, the upper and lower layers, the fact you have so many bones,
*  the fact that they're not repeating the fact that it's clearly some sort of a primate and
*  you put all this stuff together and reconstruct the skull. And I mean, what is the controversy?
*  The controversy, whether there's a couple of things, I mean, you could talk for a long time
*  about this, but I guess one point of controversy is, is it indeed a member of the human family?
*  And, you know, as I said before, you get further back in time, and the things that tell you it's
*  member of the human family become more subtle, like these canine teeth, for example.
*  The bipedality is another one. But, you know, there's, you know, a great deal of skepticism
*  in the field about, you know, there's people who I talked to who tell you, who doubt that any of these
*  early species that have been identified as hominins or early members of the human family,
*  they doubt that any of them really are, or that's just unknowable. So there's kind of like this
*  I don't know, almost in some people, this almost like nihilistic view that you can really ever know.
*  That's one. But I do think that is the validation of Arty as a member of the human family,
*  the human lineage is, I think there is a growing number of people who are accepting it.
*  Who are accepting it. And there's some people with a lot of outside people who have basically endorsed
*  what the research team has said, you know, whether it's a direct ancestor or like,
*  you know, one of your extinct aunt uncle, you know, maybe it's not your grandfather,
*  maybe it's like your aunt uncle, you know, that's we may never know that. But
*  so that anyway, that's one point of controversy. Is it is it in our human lineage? Another one is
*  the arguments that the discovery team has made about what it reveals about the last common ancestor
*  of humans and apes. And, you know, like, for example, we were talking before about
*  before about about this model of a chimp like common ancestor of humans and African apes.
*  And, you know, the Arty team spent 15 years studying this thing before they announced it
*  to the world. They believe and strenuously argued that the skeleton shows you that the common
*  ancestor of humans and the African apes was in fact not like a chimp, not nowhere near as chimp
*  like as everyone thought, because there's no vestige of knuckle walking. I mean, there's
*  a whole bunch of things that gets into sort of like some anatomical, very esoteric anatomical
*  stuff. So if you read the book for your interest, because it gets into to do all that. But
*  so anyway, so that's part of the controversy. So there is a sort of subset of the critics
*  who have come to accept Arty as indeed a member of the human family. So they say, yeah, they're
*  right. They placed it correctly in the in the human family tree. But they are not yet convinced
*  that it falsifies this idea of a chimp like ancestor. You know, their argument would be,
*  well, sure, in the ways that Arty may have still descended from this chimp like ancestor, but
*  you know, it evolved these new adaptations that sort of erase those from its anatomy. So that's
*  one element of controversy. I mean, there's the great thing about the skeleton actually,
*  because it because it is so complete, and because it was released with this huge package over this
*  whole series of paper about the hand, the foot, the pelvis, the skull. There was
*  a lot of fodder there for debate and disagreement. And that's what's been happening for the last 10
*  years. Now, when they talk about a chimp ancestor, a chimp like an ancestor, is this just because
*  chimps are around? We know genetically that we're at least closely related to chimps. So it's just
*  presumed. And is it possible that there was that all the way back, like, from the beginning,
*  that our ancestors were bipedal? Well, I don't think many people would say well, ancestors of
*  the human lineage. Right. Like when you look at Arty, Arty is the oldest known full skeleton that
*  we have of our ancestors. If we go back, if we somehow or another found something that was
*  12 million years old, what if that thing was bipedal? Okay, well, okay. So one problem is that
*  they split between humans and chimps. It's probably not that old. So if you're at 12 million,
*  you're probably somewhere before the human chimp split. I mean, there's a lot of like squish time
*  in this. So, you know, and actually, I think, actually, as it happens, I think some of the
*  estimates that are kind of furthest out are in fact 12 million, but you know, somewhere between
*  6 and 12 million where humans and chimps split, it's kind of. But they do think that once upon a
*  time, there was a split between humans and chimps. So if you go back far enough, you'll find a chimp
*  or something like a chimp. Well, you'll find an ancestor of a chimp. And then the big question is,
*  does it look like a modern chimp? Right. Or does it look like something you've never seen before?
*  Or does it look like something that's sort of a more primitive version of Artypithecus? I mean,
*  this is the great unknown. I mean, this is like, of course, another quest, you know, for science.
*  So the discovery of Artypithecus was really a monkey wrench into this whole idea of what we.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So that was what was one of the things that was quite controversial about it. And,
*  you know, we haven't talked much about the discovery team that put this together, but they are,
*  you know, they're very good scholars. They're very good at what they do,
*  but they're also quite provocative. And which, you know, for me, of course, made them great
*  material. But, you know, they don't present the skeleton and say, you know, here's a physical
*  description of the skeleton. Go ahead and make up your own minds. They presented it and it said,
*  here's a, you know, skeleton. And this is why you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong
*  and you're right. And so it was, it was a provocative, it was a provocative series of
*  papers with, with some, you know, stunning revelations, but a lot of some people in the
*  research community did not take kindly to the mode of presentation. Let's, let's say,
*  because, you know, at one point, you know, there's a, there's a, there's a huge research community
*  that studied chimpanzees, you know, either it studied them in the field, doing observational
*  studies or they had them in the lab to try to find clues about the origin of human locomotion
*  or anything. I mean, chimps are kind of became this all purpose model. And so when the arty team
*  came along and told them they're all kind of barking up the wrong tree, there was, there was
*  a lot of consternation about that. It's so fascinating to me that there was a time
*  where this thing didn't exist. We didn't know it existed and that it was only 1994.
*  And that our understanding of where the human species came from relies on these perfect
*  conditions to happen. And then someone to come across this thing at just the right time and
*  that this person has to be a skilled researcher that knows how to handle it and put like our
*  understanding of where we came from, as much as we know about, you know, the internet and space
*  travel and the galaxy. It's so crazy to me that we need to piece together our understanding
*  of the history of the human species based on these like perfect scenarios.
*  Yeah, well, that there's a reason why these skeletons are so rare. I mean, they're hard
*  to find. I mean, you need the right geological conditions. I mean, let's just start with
*  where you find these things. We're pretty certain that early human origins was in
*  Africa. Okay. I mean, that's pretty clear at this point. And humans were confined to Africa,
*  as far as we know, until about 2 million years ago when some of these primitive species started
*  to go out. So the early stories in Africa. Now you often hear people say, well, the Great Rift
*  Valley is the cradle of humanity or South Africa is the cradle of humanity or the Eden or whatever.
*  These places were not necessarily the only places that human ancestors dwell. The reason we know
*  about these things is just because these are the countries where the geological conditions favor
*  the preservation of fossils. So, you know, so there's, and so there's this whole mythology,
*  you know, it's sort of about like, well, this place or that place is like the Eden of humanity
*  or whatever. I mean, a lot of that is just self-promotion, tourist board stuff, sometimes
*  scientists self-promoting. Again, you know, they should, what they should be saying is we're not,
*  you know, the birthplace of humanity, we're the graveyard, but that doesn't have the same,
*  you know, PR appeal. We're the graveyard of humanity. But if you look at where fossils are
*  found, like look at a map of Africa, it's a tiny portion of the African continent is, has a fossil
*  record. And, you know, and the, you know, there's like Ethiopia, we've talked about this Kenya,
*  there's, you know, South Africa has the different geological conditions there that explain,
*  you know, but the South Africa things tend to be preserved in caves, tend to be a little,
*  you know, not quite as old as the oldest things from the Rift Valley. But we have a few scatterings
*  of things elsewhere, like in Chad and some other countries, but most of Africa is totally unknown,
*  the fossil record. And so there could be a large part of the human story of just, you know,
*  evolutionary biology in general that are just, just gone, or at least not yet discovered. So we,
*  you know, our windows into the past are like these little pinholes, you know, and the places
*  where you find those things, like in this Afar Depression of Ethiopia that I'm talking about,
*  are pretty rare. So you need to have those rare places. And then you also need to have this skill.
*  And this is not an easy, I mean, I've spent a couple of, going out to the field with this
*  particular group a couple of times, and this is not easy work to do at all. It's not easy
*  to find the stuff, to have the eyes to see it, and then, you know, to spot it on the ground.
*  And it's also not easy to do just logistically. I mean, like right now, for example, I mean,
*  the work in Ethiopia has kind of come to a standstill because their country is again having,
*  you know, some political turmoil. There's fear that might be heading into civil war. And so that
*  means it's too, you know, a lot of these teams are probably reluctant to go to the field because,
*  you know, because of the danger. And so we're kind of back to a situation like what I was
*  describing earlier, you know, where it's just too dicey to go into the field. So anyway, so why are
*  there so, and it gets back to the question, why are there so few skeletons? Well, the places where
*  you find it are rare. The logistical challenges are severe. And also the skill level that it takes to
*  find something, even if it does exist, is, that takes a lot of skill. I was quite impressed when
*  I went there to see how people could find things because I, you know, people would find things that
*  I, as a lay person walking, just could not see. It just makes you wonder how much we've missed,
*  how much people have stumbled upon where they didn't have that skill or they didn't know what
*  they were looking at or they weren't trained, they weren't educated in it, and they just
*  found some piece of something that probably could have changed the way we look at our history.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it's just like, yeah. Amazing. Yeah, I mean, there could be, you know,
*  I mean, somewhere under the surface in Africa, there's all kinds of skeletons and fossils that
*  could answer all kinds of questions for us. But if it's just buried that far underneath the surface
*  and some surveyor comes along and walks over it, there's nothing eroding to the surface yet,
*  you know, it's invisible. Right, and there's so much ground space.
*  There are something eroding. Yeah, yeah, and so it's, it's, yeah, you only know, you know,
*  what you can find. Now, since the time of the initial discovery in 1994, there's been a lot of
*  different versions of the human being that have also been discovered. Like, how many different
*  humans have they discovered now? I know it was, what is it called? Denisovans? Is that what they,
*  the name of them? Is that right? Yeah, so that is some fragments of bone that are from a cave up
*  in Siberia. And actually that that was kind of interesting because they were able to get some
*  ancient DNA out of it. So stuff like Artie and Lucy are too old to get, you know, DNA out of all
*  the biological materials gone. But in some of the newer stuff, younger stuff, there,
*  the, they can get what they call ancient DNA out of them. So, I mean, just as an example,
*  that about 10 years ago, some researchers were able to extract some DNA from some old Neanderthal
*  bones. And there's been this interesting question, you know, for decades about whether Neanderthals,
*  you know, Neanderthals are of course, of these famous, you know, fossil species known from
*  Europe and from Asia. And for a long time, there had been this debate about whether Neanderthals
*  evolved into modern humans. There was one school of thought that thought they did. And then another
*  school who thought they called the kind of the out of Africa group who believe that another species
*  of homo sapiens, that's us, you know, arose in Africa and then moved into Europe and Asia and
*  displaced, you know, the Neanderthals and basically either outcompeted them or killed them or whatever.
*  Somehow we showed up, they disappeared. And so, you know, and probably in some of the early DNA
*  studies kind of supported that out of Africa deal, that sort of displacement thing. But anyway,
*  about 10 years ago, the people that study ancient DNA were able to start extracting ancient DNA
*  from some Neanderthal bones that had not completely fossilized. So there was like a little bit of
*  biological material there where they could start to knit together, you know, these ancient genomes.
*  And that science has advanced a lot. I mean, it's astounding what they're doing now. And I
*  shouldn't say too much about it because that's not my focus. So don't ask me too many hard
*  questions about that. But anyway, so one of the things that they have discovered was that, in fact,
*  there was some interbreeding between these modern homo sapiens who came out of Africa
*  and went to Europe and Asia. And there's some portions of the Neanderthal genome that are still
*  alive or still exist in the genomes of people who are of what they call non-African descent.
*  So basically, the people who left Africa, you know, interbred, at least to a limited degree,
*  with Neanderthals. And so there's a little Neanderthal in a lot of us. So that's like a
*  huge, huge revelation. And then there's been many other revelations with ancient DNA. I mean,
*  this Denisobans is another one. So it appears that, anyway, you asked about all these ancient
*  species and I don't know how many there are now. There's probably a couple dozen members.
*  Really? A couple dozen? Really? There's that many?
*  Yeah. Well, there are names. I mean, this is a controversial thing too, because it's like,
*  um, you get, if you are a scientist, you find, let's say, a fossil. And if you name it something
*  new, there's great incentive, there's great incentive to name something new because, you know,
*  new species headlines, you know, and it's, it's, it's interesting. Let's say you find another
*  something that is a species that's already known, you know, maybe it's just like a variation of that
*  or, you know, slightly older, slightly younger, slightly like, you know, physically different.
*  I mean, you know, you know, ho-hum, who cares? That stuff just doesn't get the same amount of
*  attention. So there, so there is, you know, a professional bias, I think, toward naming new
*  species. Now, some of this stuff, I mean, there's no question it's a new species, you know, you know,
*  I mean, Ardipithecus is one, there's many other things that have been discovered, but, you know,
*  the thing that's difficult here is that the whole idea of species is people say, oh, something is a
*  species, but that what does that mean? And, you know, in modern humans, for all we like to talk
*  about our diversity, we're actually at least genetically pretty homogenous, you know, compared
*  to other primates. And so I think in the ancient past, there's probably, there's probably a lot of
*  variation, at least in some species that's greater than what we see in ourselves now. So,
*  in any way, and then, so that's, that's part of the problem that creates this debate about
*  whether something is a new species or just another example of something that we already know about.
*  The other thing is that, yeah, yeah, go ahead. I was gonna say, that little guy that they found
*  on the island of Flores, Homo Floriensis, is that what you say? Yeah, this little dwarf like thing.
*  Yeah. Was that considered a human? Yeah. Well, that's a big, that's again, another point of
*  debate. I mean, there's, there's everyone, I haven't heard anyone doubt that it's a member of the, of
*  the human family, but it's really weird because it has like this, yeah, it's like, yeah, people have,
*  there's this phenomenal called island dwarfism where sometimes things like that, like, like,
*  let's say it goes on island, the sea levels change, you know, things get small or something's get big.
*  Like reptiles. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they're bigger on islands, right? Yeah. Like Komodo dragons or
*  whatever. But, but in this case, you know, this thing got small. And so there's a big debate about
*  what it evolved from. And, you know, are there, are there more of these things? I mean, that's,
*  yeah. That's as recently as how, I mean, it wasn't that long ago, right? Wasn't it like 15,000 years
*  ago or something crazy? I don't remember, but yeah, it is, it is, it is recent. I don't remember
*  the exact number, but it's something remarkable, frequently recent. Yeah. Yeah. And certainly,
*  what's certainly within the life, the, the, the lifetime of our species. Yeah. Well, it's,
*  it's something where the crypto zoology, which is always a weird thing, right? But there's people
*  that believe, I think it's called the Orang Pendek. There's a legendary animal in the jungle of
*  Vietnam that is very much like this homo florensis, a very small person, very small, hairy little
*  person that lives in the jungle. I think it's Vietnam, I'm pretty sure. And they, they think
*  now that, well, hey, they might be really talking about something that did exist thousands of years
*  ago. What is this a fossil species? I am not aware. It's a legend. I think it's probably,
*  it's probably a lot of it is horse shit, but it's when, when they found this homo florensis,
*  I think a lot of the people that were proponents of this Orang Pendek thing, they were like, well,
*  hey, that's what we're talking about. Like this is the, this is the actual creature, a little small,
*  hairy person. Okay. Is this like the big foot of Vietnam? Exactly. But it's a little foot.
*  It's a little tiny guy. Yeah. But the speculation is, you know, that this thing used to be, they
*  just thought it was just a, one of those crazy legends. But now they think, Hey, you know,
*  they might've been talking about something that existed in human history like this homo florensis
*  did. Yeah. Yeah. Well, maybe, yeah, maybe it's a mutant from, I don't know, Agent Orange or something
*  that, uh, I think they're talking, I think it's a pretty old story. I think it's predates Vietnam.
*  Yeah. Well, so anyway, just, just a final note on the species, just a little food for thought. So,
*  you know, people bandy around this term species, like, and people don't really question the
*  category. And so the weird thing about species is, um, we know, okay, so the, well, there's a lot of
*  definitions in biology. One of them is the classic definition, the biological species definition.
*  And this dates from the 1940s from a guy named Ernst Maher, who's a prominent biologist, uh, a
*  very important historical figure. But anyway, he defined the species as the group, the population
*  that could breed with each other. Okay. So you can make babies, you have the opportunity to make
*  babies, you're a species. So it's this big, inclusive thing. Right. And, uh, but of course,
*  you know, with a lot of the fossil species, you know, we don't know who could breed with who,
*  we just know what they look like, what's physically different. And so, you know, for a long time,
*  I mean, so take humans and Neanderthals has been this big debate, you know, what's the relation
*  between them? Did they interbreed? You know, um, and, uh, so a Neanderthal is something that looks
*  sufficiently different from, you know, Homo sapiens that it's put in a different category.
*  So the, one of the big wows of ancient DNA is you have two things that look physically
*  different enough to be, you know, under categorize a different species. But now the genetics tell us
*  that they, they, they were able to, they, they were, they didn't read. So now there's like this
*  big problem with like, what is a species? Like, what do you, you know, and I don't think biology
*  has, has at least, I mean, I'm sure others have different opinions about this and some avoid the
*  question altogether, but that was one thing I wrestled with this book. You know, it's like people,
*  we have this, we're using like language to describe biology, but those are two different
*  mediums. And sometimes the biology defies the categories of language and the categories of
*  classification. And this is, this is like a constant theme through, well, at least in human
*  origin sciences that, you know, when people build these categories and these narratives,
*  to construct, to sort of hold the facts of what little we know, but then, you know, the
*  body of knowledge expands and suddenly, you know, your old categories are leaking all over the place.
*  Right. And that's, that's there in lies the limitations of calling these things humans.
*  Yeah. Well, you can call them humans. You could call them speeches. I don't, I don't know the, the,
*  the answer to that. Except that we should be, well, clearly you need language to have,
*  you know, for precision, you know, for science. I mean, that's absolutely necessary, but
*  you can't be too dogmatic about your categories because nature is not dogmatic. Nature is far more
*  fluid and dynamic than that.
*  And we don't have a complete picture of the exact process from ancient ape to human being
*  in the current form. We don't have a, no, we have a series of snapshots, snapshots that we've been
*  lucky enough to capture. And Artipithecus is one, you know, Lucy was one, Homo erectus, you know,
*  Homo naledi, you know, you know, this, this Denisovans, the little florist thing. I mean,
*  those are all these snapshots, but you know, it's not like we have anything
*  like a complete picture. I mean, you can, you can certainly see some trends, some through lines,
*  you know, from the more, you know, primitive things to modern things, you know, the
*  coming more advanced bipeds, the limb proportions changing, you know, the brain, of course growing.
*  That's a huge storyline in human evolution. But there are a lot of,
*  yeah, all we have are these snapshots that we're lucky enough to get because of just the
*  happenstance of geology and discovery. Can I, can I say one other thing about species that I've,
*  that I found quite interesting in this whole thing. So you've probably heard about like the
*  tree of life and, you know, the human family tree and, you know, and I mean, this is an old metaphor
*  and, but like the tree is kind of having a little trouble right now. Not that we should get rid of
*  it, but it's, you know, so when you have this idea of a tree where everything is splitting into dead
*  ends, you know, it leaves these questions, what people say, like humans in the end of the world,
*  which one led to modern humans. And it becomes like this either or thing, right? So when you
*  have all these species that look different from, I'm trying to center my hand in the frame here,
*  here we go. That, and I think it is sometimes led science into false choices where we say, okay,
*  well, you know, the ancestor has to either be this one or that one because look, there's a split here,
*  you know, and they went their separate ways because that's kind of what the tree metaphor
*  depicts. But actually what ancient DNA is showing you is that things that are actually looking
*  different are actually able, you're getting some crossover there. And so now your tree is looking a
*  lot, a lot less like a tree. It's looking more like a web or a lattice. Sometimes people are using
*  these, searching for these other metaphors to kind of convey the complexity of what
*  biology is showing, but it's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a lot more complex than like the simple
*  trees of like, you know, the species and, and, and anyway, just wanted to insert that little
*  word of caution about the tree. I mean, the tree is a really powerful metaphor for the diversity of
*  life, but when creatures that have recently split, you know, those branches don't necessarily
*  remain isolated from each other. They can have some crossover and some interbreeding or
*  hybridization, whatever you want to call it, that makes it kind of hard to give you
*  a few nice, neat through lines from this species to that species.
*  Right. This is what I was going to get to with all these various species of human or thing,
*  or different types of humans that we know of now since 1994. Is it possible that, that there was,
*  that there were multiple different types of creatures like Ardipithecus, like there's
*  multiple different types of what we call a human being and that they're simultaneously evolving
*  in these different parts of the world in a similar timeline and creating the Denisovans and the
*  homofloriensis and homo sapiens and Neanderthals. And it's all just kind of happening, you know,
*  at the same time, but not along the exact same timeline with the exact same ancestor.
*  Okay. Well, okay. So let's take Ardipithecus.
*  Because at that point, Ardipithecus is only known at this point, as far as I know, from Ethiopia.
*  And one is the middle Awash, the place where Artie came from that I was describing earlier.
*  And then they've also found some other Ardipithecus at a place called Gona,
*  which is basically another project area that's adjacent to the middle Awash. They're basically
*  neighbors. So, you know, this is in this one part of Ethiopia. But so how widespread was
*  Ardipithecus in Africa? How, you know, did it range through the entire continent or was it a regional
*  species? I don't, I guess the answer is unknown. And, you know, for the reasons I mentioned earlier,
*  that there's just so little of Africa that gives you the windows into the past. But anyway, so,
*  but there is another Ardipithecus skeleton that's been announced in the last couple of years from
*  Gona. And that one is interesting. So it is, it has, so Ardipithecus, the original already had this
*  opposable toe and it walked when it was upright, it apparently walked with the toe kind of splayed
*  off to the side, you know, kind of like an outrigger, you know, at this Gona creature.
*  They have something that they're calling a skeleton. I haven't actually seen it. I don't
*  think it's actually been, they've published, they revealed its existence, but I haven't seen a picture
*  of it. And I don't think they've revealed that. But I was talking to the scientist there, there's
*  a fellow named Scott Simpson from Case Western Preserve University, and he's a very competent
*  paleoanthropologist. And he says that their creature has this toe that's like Ardipithecus.
*  I mean, you know, there's no doubt they belong to the same species, but this one has its toe more
*  more in line with the foot. So it's more kind of human-like. So, you know, it's still, it's,
*  what's the time? It's about the same age as Ardipithecus. So around, it's like 4.4, 4.5.
*  So anyway, so the point here is that there is, you know, just as there is in modern species,
*  like baboons or whatever, there's different populations or subspecies that sometimes
*  develop different adaptations for whatever reason. And they're quite similar, but you'd get these
*  variations, you know, for whatever reason of a local adaptation. So...
*  How far apart are they from the original Ardi?
*  It's, I'm not sure. It's like maybe 50 miles or within that. It's just down, the river that runs
*  through there is called the Awash River, and Gona is the project area that's immediately downstream
*  of the middle Awash where Ardi was found. Is it speculation that they were living in the same
*  specific type of environment? Do they know that?
*  Yeah, they, well, there's some difference in environmental interpretation between the two,
*  but they're similar. The reason why I ask,
*  have you ever seen images of indigenous people on the Amazon that walk around barefoot and their
*  feet literally start to look like hands? They splay out in a very bizarre way.
*  I haven't seen those particular pictures, but I do know that people that walk around unshod,
*  you know, so in other words, without shoes, tend to develop these toes that are more divergent,
*  not opposable like a primate, but for whatever reason about being unshod, it just gives you,
*  you know, you look at the toe and it's like it's like visibly separated.
*  Yes, we're looking at a picture of it right now on the screen.
*  And it's very strange where it's almost like they're gripping the ground with their toes,
*  and the toes are very thick and strong because they're constantly walking around barefoot and
*  they use their toes and the toe muscles in a way that we don't use them anymore because we're
*  essentially we're in casts with our shoes.
*  Yeah, well, you know what's really interesting about me when we look at like modern adaptations
*  of modern humans, you know, in all these different pockets of the world or, you know,
*  particularly when you look into all these ancient species, which are even weirder,
*  is he realized there's nothing about our form that's like an end destination.
*  There's nothing about our form that is like we have arrived at this was, you know,
*  where primates were going the whole time.
*  You know, if you want to talk about who are the weird ones, it's not all these other things.
*  It's like the modern humans are weird.
*  We got these big heads.
*  We got this funny way of walking.
*  We're bald, you know, and we vary so much.
*  Yeah, and we vary.
*  And then, you know, there's all these kind of myths about why.
*  I mean, God, there's so many myths in the field of human origins.
*  But one of them is you've probably heard about like the divine proportions or like golden ratio
*  that humans were constructed, you know, according to these ratios and like the so-called golden
*  ratio. This is just storytelling.
*  You know, I mean, there's nothing about our proportions.
*  Our proportions are just a function of adaptation.
*  They're a function of evolutionary biology.
*  And, you know, when certain chemicals are released in developmental process that governs
*  how long your limbs grow or your digits or whatever.
*  But there's, you know, we're just all variations of primate.
*  Yeah, we're just we're just one of them.
*  And so, yeah, so sometimes you see literature or people positing that, you know, somehow
*  there was something like an end.
*  We've reached some sort of end state or and I'll tell you, we're not reaching end state.
*  We're just a variation of, you know, creatures that have that adapt, you know,
*  they take these common elements and adapt them, you know, for different,
*  for, you know, for different uses and modern humans, though we do vary size wise much more
*  than ancient apes that we find, though, correct?
*  Like we don't like, for instance, like, you know, mountain from the Game of Thrones,
*  that enormous giant human being, that's a human being.
*  I don't. I should confess I am sort of illiterate when it comes to pop culture.
*  Oh, OK.
*  My kids would know. I need to turn to them.
*  You know, I'm kind of like he's literally one of the world's strongest men.
*  He's like seven feet plus tall, 300 plus pounds, enormous.
*  But my point was that like that he exists as a human being.
*  Also, Chris Rock is a human being and he's a very thin, very small man.
*  Like, but they're both human beings.
*  We don't find that when you're looking at things like Neanderthal or were you looking at you find
*  much more uniformity. Is that correct?
*  Well, no, not necessarily. Actually, actually, in some cases, there's there's a lot of variation.
*  And I'll give you one good example.
*  So Lucy, you know, there's this famous fossil Lucy was the species is called
*  Australopithecus aparensis named aparensis after the Afar, you know, this part of the world
*  where I was describing the Afar Depression.
*  She was discovered in 1974. She's very petite, probably a female.
*  And I forget how tall she is, but it's like three foot something.
*  And Artie is a female too, correct?
*  Artie is a female. Artie is taller.
*  Artie is, you know, a head taller than Lucy.
*  But anyway, so with Lucy, you know, when her skeleton was found, you know, this was,
*  you know, the only skeleton of that species.
*  They had a lot of other pieces of things, but no skeletons.
*  But there was this assumption that that species was small and or at least the female.
*  And now, thanks to some other work that's done in Ethiopia to place called Oranzamele.
*  A few years ago, a team announced discovery of another skeleton of Lucy species.
*  It's a male. It's a lot bigger than Lucy.
*  They call it catanumu, which is a Afar word for big guy.
*  But it's the same species as Lucy, but it's a big guy, you know, substantially taller.
*  So it sort of falsifies this idea that all Lucy's species was petite.
*  So interesting.
*  And why is that? Is that because there's a so-called sexual
*  demorphism of males are bigger than females?
*  Or is it just a different population?
*  Or is that just, you know, just a difference in, you know, the normal range within a population,
*  you know, like, you have short people and tall people, you know, in our, you know, in any population?
*  I don't know.
*  But they're both mature specimens.
*  Yeah. And they're both attributed to the same species.
*  So anyway, just to give you an example of a paleo species where there is actually a substantial variation.
*  How much difference is it between Lucy and this other one?
*  It's I don't know.
*  Actually, I wish I had looked this up before we talked, because I'd love to hear.
*  I'd love to give you a number, but it the big guy is substantially taller and bigger than Lucy.
*  But but the skeletons, they have, you know, the anatomy is similar enough so that they are
*  attributed to the same species.
*  Interesting.
*  And they're similar age like Catanumu, I think is like 3.6 million years old.
*  And Lucy's, I think 3.2.
*  So when we look at humans like the Denisovans, and we consider that to be a different human
*  than Homo sapien or than Neanderthal, do we have any idea how that came about?
*  Well, so first of all, I should say I don't know much about Denisovans.
*  My understanding is there's not too much skeletal preserved of it.
*  I mean, they have enough bones, they've obviously been able to take.
*  It's a fairly recent discovery, right?
*  Yeah, it's within the last, I don't know, 10 years or something.
*  So it's a question like, why do they look so different?
*  Is that?
*  Yeah, like what, where did they come from?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  And I don't think a lot is known about that.
*  Maybe the scientists are studying it no more than they've published.
*  But I don't know much about it.
*  But anyway, just the general idea of why do these things look so different?
*  So there's this concept in science that helps explain this.
*  And this is, you know, some people call it, these are all, it's speciation.
*  It's just like an adaptive radiation of all these things going out
*  and turning into these different species.
*  And that's kind of one way to look at it.
*  But the way I prefer to look at it is what the scientists call isolation by distance,
*  which sounds like horribly boring.
*  I know you're like, what the hell does that mean?
*  But basically what it means is that things spread out.
*  And particularly when humans got the technology,
*  ancient humans got the technology to basically live in all these different parts of the world,
*  they were isolated and then could adapt, make these local adaptations,
*  which make them look, make the Neanderthals look different
*  than the Sub-Saharan Africans, for example, who were their contemporaries.
*  But yet they're still closely enough related.
*  So when they do come back in contact, as they sometimes do,
*  they can still potentially interbreed.
*  So what the isolation by distance means,
*  it just means that these things spread out enough so that they get local adaptations.
*  You know, like your example from the Amazon or like, you know, people from
*  the Inuit, from the northern areas or whatever.
*  It's such a fascinating field of study because you just,
*  you see how they're piecing together this puzzle slowly but surely.
*  And it just, for someone who's impatient,
*  you're not going to get the answers to this very quickly.
*  It's so amazing though.
*  Yeah, but the truth is always so much more interesting than the fiction.
*  So I'm just a journalist, right?
*  So I'm not a scientist.
*  So I should just remind people of that.
*  But if I were a scientist in this field,
*  you just have this lifetime of material ahead of you.
*  And you just know that the revelations are going to be so fantastic.
*  Like there's, you know, like genomic science.
*  I mean, I know my book is about fossils and that's mostly what I know about.
*  But, you know, genomics, genetics and ancient DNA, it's an important,
*  you know, cutting edge right now.
*  But anyway, there's a guy, one of the prominent geneticists in Harvard named David Reich,
*  he says, we're just, we're like kindergartners in our knowledge of this stuff at some point.
*  I mean, as advanced as the science is and as amazing as the breakthroughs have been,
*  they're still only just beginning to understand like how, you know,
*  that genetic code really translates into biology, for example.
*  You know, the code has been transcribed.
*  We now have, you know, the three billion, you know, places in the human genome, you know, transcribed.
*  But what does that mean?
*  You know, what does the code say and how does that code turn into
*  artipithecus and Denisovans and you and me?
*  I mean, there's so many questions waiting to be answered.
*  And yeah, if you're an impatient person, you won't get the big answers,
*  maybe in our lifetime, you know, for the big questions.
*  But God, there's so many fascinating questions that are within reach that are being answered.
*  It's, you know, endlessly fascinating.
*  As a journalist, when you're writing a book about this and you have to take a deep dive
*  into all the science behind it and just the history of it, what is that experience like for you?
*  I mean, it seems like it would be all consuming because it's such a deep field of study.
*  It was all consuming for me.
*  I mean, this book took me a lot longer than I ever intended.
*  What did you intend?
*  Well, people would keep, you know, people would ask.
*  I mean, I had numerous conversations that went like this, right?
*  We talked to some scientists, you know, someone had been talking to her.
*  I was like, oh, yeah, what's your timeline?
*  And I'd say, I'll probably be done this time next year.
*  I mean, I was saying that in like 2012.
*  Here the book is being published, you know, this week.
*  So part of that, I mean, and this kind of gets to the richness of the story that I was telling
*  you about.
*  I mean, so I was, you know, there was this interesting story about this fossil,
*  the oldest skeleton ever found in the human family.
*  So I wanted to understand like the full life cycle of that discovery, like how the hunt,
*  the research question was framed in the beginning and then, you know, how it was found,
*  interpreted, announced the world and then all the debate that followed.
*  So that's, you know, I want to follow the life cycle of this whole thing through because to me,
*  that's a really interesting story.
*  And then there are all these interesting components along the way, like, you know,
*  geology and genomics and developmental biology and, you know, the anatomy of all these different
*  parts.
*  So anyway, yeah, that obliged me to sort of learn all these topics.
*  And so that was just a lot of reading, a lot of talking to people.
*  I mean, I'm so indebted to a lot of scientists who guided me, you know, through the geology,
*  through the field work, through the interpretation of the skeleton.
*  They, I mean, they provided a service to me personally, but they also, more importantly,
*  provided a service to public understanding.
*  And, you know, I can't say enough how grateful I am to those people.
*  Where do you go from here?
*  I mean, when you spend eight years working on a book about an ancient ancestor to human beings,
*  and then you take a big deep breath, you do all the publicity work, where do you go from here?
*  That's a good question.
*  I'll go back into a cave, probably, you know, to write another book.
*  You know, it'll be on a different topic for sure.
*  I mean, I like, you know, stories that have narrative and I like stories that have depth.
*  And, you know, this one was quite rewarding.
*  It's quite challenging.
*  I can't spend that long on every book because I'll be dead, you know, before,
*  you know, before, you know, before I get anywhere.
*  But so anyway, I'm looking at a topic now.
*  It'll be, you know, sort of deep history of science.
*  I have to do a lot of legwork to see if it'll pan out the way I think it is.
*  I mean, I, yeah, I tend to keep things under wraps until I know that it's going to be worthwhile to do.
*  So that way, I'll keep under wraps.
*  But something like that, something, a big story with characters and with depth and narrative.
*  And do you just choose them based on your curiosity?
*  Like what's intriguing to you?
*  Yeah. Well, like with Arnipithecus, I didn't really choose it in the sense that, like,
*  I sort of sat down eight years ago and said, okay, well, what am I going to do?
*  I mean, as I said, I started off on this other road.
*  And then it just, over time, this story just sort of appeared in front of me and sort of told me that
*  there's another road here that actually might be more rewarding.
*  And then, you know, as I kind of went along, I kept having to stop and learn about,
*  you know, the geology and all these component sciences or about Ethiopia.
*  We haven't talked much about that, but that, you know, the backdrop of Ethiopia while all this was
*  going on is an important part of the story at multiple levels.
*  I mean, there's the turmoil in the country that makes it difficult to work there.
*  There is the sort of ascendance of indigenous African scientists from Ethiopia who are entering
*  the science and sort of claiming a place at the table, you know, in a science that has,
*  you know, some colonialist roots.
*  There's all these component pieces that took me up, were not visible at the outset, but I just sort
*  of had to delve into them as I waded through this topic.
*  And believe me, there was a lot of pain and suffering that went into this book.
*  I mean, I know parts of it are, you know, sometimes, you know, strike people as maybe
*  hard science, but believe me that there was, like, I could have written and did write in some cases
*  what you might see in like a couple sentences that I tossed off about this or that.
*  There may have been a 10 page draft of that topic or five page or whatever that I needed to write
*  to be able to understand it and then to reduce it, reduce it, reduce it, and then sort of,
*  you know, reduce it down to just one brick that I could just sort of put on the wall of this story.
*  But yeah, there was a lot of that and that accounts for why it was such a drawn out process.
*  Well, congratulations on the completion and thank you very much for spending some time with me there.
*  I really appreciate it, man. I really enjoyed it.
*  Oh, no, it's a great pleasure. You have a great show. It's eclectic and I'm still,
*  you know, scratching my head trying to think of where I fit in with, you know, Bernie and Kanye
*  and all these other guys. But I'm, hey.
*  You fit in that I'm interested in what you do.
*  I'm just glad to be here.
*  You fit in because it's a fascinating subject to me.
*  All right. Well, thank you for, yeah, high five with the things. It's been a pleasure.
*  So can you hold up a copy of the book behind you? It's right over your shoulder
*  so people can get an image of it.
*  Yeah. So this, the book is Fossil Men. It's published by Harper Collins,
*  William Morrow imprinted and it is kind of, it's released November 10th.
*  All right.
*  And this is Artie's hand right here.
*  I think November 10th is today, right? Isn't it today?
*  Yeah, it'll be the day of the show.
*  Yeah. Tomorrow. Yeah. Well, the day come today's the ninth that we're filming this.
*  It'll come out tomorrow on the 10th. All right. Beautiful. Thank you, Kermit. Appreciate it, man.
*  Thank you. You guys do a great job. Thank you.
*  Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
