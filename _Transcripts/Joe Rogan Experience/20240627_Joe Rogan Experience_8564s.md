# Joe Rogan Experience #2026 - Peter Berg
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Showing by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening? Good to see you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Good to see you, my friend. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=14.0s)]
*  Your show is fantastic. It's really good, man. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=15.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=18.0s)]
*  Painkiller on Netflix. Can't recommend it enough. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=19.0s)]
*  I'm only two episodes deep. I started the third today. It's so fucking good, dude. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=22.0s)]
*  And it's so disturbing because it's true. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=27.0s)]
*  It's an accurate account of how this all happened. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=31.0s)]
*  It makes you so uncomfortable to think that there's people in the world that would do what the Sackler family did. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=34.0s)]
*  Do you know anyone who's gone down from opioids? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=43.0s)]
*  Quite a few. Quite a few people. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=47.0s)]
*  When they first came to me and asked me if I was interested, my buddy Eric Newman, who put the whole thing together, said, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=50.0s)]
*  Do you want to do something about the Sacklers? Do you know who the Sacklers are? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=60.0s)]
*  And I did. I knew they were the family behind OxyContin. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=63.0s)]
*  And he said, Are you interested? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=67.0s)]
*  And I started thinking and I started counting the people I know who've died or whose kids have died because of OxyContin and opioids. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=69.0s)]
*  And I quickly got off of both fingers. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=78.0s)]
*  And then I started thinking about some of my heroes, my artistic heroes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Chris Cornell, Tom Petty, and one of my big heroes was Prince. I was a huge, huge Prince fan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=88.0s)]
*  I went to school in Minneapolis when he was coming up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=95.0s)]
*  I was in Extra in Purple Rain back in the day, First Avenue in Minneapolis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=98.0s)]
*  And those three guys, when Prince died, Prince was legendary for his work ethic and his lifestyle. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=104.0s)]
*  No alcohol, no swearing, just incredible work ethic. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=114.0s)]
*  And the fact that OxyContin got him, that really kind of fucked with me. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=118.0s)]
*  So when they came to me and started talking to me about doing something about the Sacklers, I was like, Yeah, I'm all in. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=125.0s)]
*  And the more I dug into it, the more experts and writers who have been covering this epidemic for so long, the more I learned. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=132.0s)]
*  I'm not necessarily the biggest conspiracy guy of all time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=142.0s)]
*  I do. If the proof's there, I'm down. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=147.0s)]
*  But the more I learned about the Sacklers and how they maneuvered what is essentially just heroin in like a little M&M pill, you know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=151.0s)]
*  how they were so artful and so good at manipulating the system, I was shocked and I was all in on Painkiller. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=161.0s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you were all in because people need to know this story. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=171.0s)]
*  And a lot of people aren't going to watch a documentary and, you know, they're not going to read about it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=175.0s)]
*  This is a very entertaining show that shows accurately how this went down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=180.0s)]
*  And, you know, there's a there's a moment and I want to give too much away, but there's one moment where this ethical doctor confronts the salesgirl. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=186.0s)]
*  And that's a very, very, very powerful moment. Yeah. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=194.0s)]
*  Because that the ethical doctor who knows everything about opiates is essentially explaining to this very young girl, just a beautiful salesgirl that you're selling heroin. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=197.0s)]
*  This is heroin. It's indistinguishable to the body. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=209.0s)]
*  It's heroin. It's just you're calling it a different thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=212.0s)]
*  And this idea that it's only one percent of the people have problems with it is those numbers are all lies. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=216.0s)]
*  They're always lies. They lie about how many people died. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=223.0s)]
*  They lie about how many people get addicted. It's all a lie. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=227.0s)]
*  And if they can keep lying and not face any repercussions, they'll keep lying because that's they almost have an obligation to their shareholders to do that. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah. And in this case, they didn't even have shareholders. It was a private company. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=243.0s)]
*  The Richard Sackler and his his uncles were making all the money. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=247.0s)]
*  They completely lied. I mean, there were doctors and they knew how powerful the opioid dosage was. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=252.0s)]
*  And they knew that. And what else is crazy is they knew that if they just kept they would make so much more money by what they call titrating up. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=260.0s)]
*  So, you know, we put you on 10 milligrams of Oxycontin because you're you blew out your back in the gym and it works for a bit. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=270.0s)]
*  And then when it doesn't, we're like, oh, well, we just got to we got to we got to kick you up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=279.0s)]
*  So let's put you on 20 and then let's put you on 40. And they got up to 85 milligram Oxycontin. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=284.0s)]
*  They call them oxy coffins. That was in the word on the street. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=290.0s)]
*  And these these reps, these cute little reps, these pretty little college grad graduates were just looking to make some money were paid based bonuses based on the amount of milligrams in the pill. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=294.0s)]
*  So I'm I'm trying to convince you if I'm a rep and you're a doctor just to kick it up, doc, prescribe 20 or 40 or 85 milligrams and everybody will make some more money. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=309.0s)]
*  And that was the game that the Sacklers were playing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=322.0s)]
*  And like, you know, I've said, like, I'm down with capitalism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=326.0s)]
*  No problem. Like, make money, do it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=330.0s)]
*  And if you just look at the Sacklers, you know, from a capitalistic perspective and you apply, you know, rules of capitalism and you're on their grade, they get a plus. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=333.0s)]
*  They were fucking good at making money. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=344.0s)]
*  You put like that much morality into the equation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=347.0s)]
*  And these are some evil human beings. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=350.0s)]
*  It's unquestionably evil. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=353.0s)]
*  And what's even more evil is they got away with it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=356.0s)]
*  They paid off. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=359.0s)]
*  They had to give away a certain amount of money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=361.0s)]
*  I think it's six billion. See if we could find a settlement. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=364.0s)]
*  A little bit around six. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=366.0s)]
*  And now they can't be prosecuted. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=368.0s)]
*  So they essentially bought their way out of going to jail for directly being responsible for the deaths of how many people? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=371.0s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=379.0s)]
*  So in the most bizarre coincidence I've ever experienced in my years of being in the business, the day painkiller came out, the Supreme Court paused that decision. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=380.0s)]
*  Have you heard this? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=391.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=392.0s)]
*  It's a fascinating story. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=393.0s)]
*  I want you to read about this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=394.0s)]
*  The day we came out was about 12 days ago now. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=395.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court said, hold up. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=398.0s)]
*  You cannot cut a deal. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=404.0s)]
*  So the Supreme Court blocks Purdue Pharm a six billion dollar Sackler opioid settlement. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=406.0s)]
*  The justices will examine if bankruptcy court can force claimants to sign away their legal rights in a settlement. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=410.0s)]
*  So let me break it down quick because this is actually fascinating for anyone who's paying attention. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=417.0s)]
*  The deal that they cut, Purdue cut, was six billion dollars. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=422.0s)]
*  We're going to pay six billion dollars to all the victims of OxyContin, but we're going to do that over the next two decades. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=426.0s)]
*  We're going to parcel it out. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=433.0s)]
*  And Sackler's have maybe 15 bill in the bank, give or take. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=435.0s)]
*  So they're just counting on interest rates to pay that six billion. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=439.0s)]
*  And the deal they had cut said, we'll pay you the six, but you can never. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=443.0s)]
*  There's no more. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=447.0s)]
*  And you can never come after any more of our money and you can never come after us for any criminal charges. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=448.0s)]
*  So they were basically buying their way to safety for six bill. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=454.0s)]
*  And they that deal was taken. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=458.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court just said, hold up. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=460.0s)]
*  Not so fast. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=462.0s)]
*  We're not going to accept that deal. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=464.0s)]
*  You may have to pay more and we may go after you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=465.0s)]
*  So now the potential for them to face true bankruptcy and maybe more is on the table. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=468.0s)]
*  How accurate do we know like some of the I know this is a docu drama, right? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=475.0s)]
*  Is that how you would describe it? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=480.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=482.0s)]
*  Based on a real life, real life events. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=483.0s)]
*  Some of the things that he that Sackler said in both the older Sackler and the younger Sackler, Richard and what was his dad's name? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=486.0s)]
*  Arthur, Arthur, his uncle. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah, his uncle. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=497.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=498.0s)]
*  Both of those the statements that they're so horrific. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=499.0s)]
*  Do we know they definitely said that? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=504.0s)]
*  Well, so there yes, there's so many horrific things they said. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=505.0s)]
*  One of the things we know that they did said, which was like like one of the original strategies that Purdue Pharma had that they were advised to to adopt by their lawyers and their advisors and their marketing guys when they realized that people were dying. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=509.0s)]
*  The kids were crushing up Oxycontin and snorting it and getting addicted and overdose. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=525.0s)]
*  And when they realized it was being misused this way, their strategy was, quote, hammer the abusers, hammer the abusers. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=530.0s)]
*  So your Joe, your 19 year old daughter has just dropped out of an Oxycontin overdose. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=540.0s)]
*  The response of Purdue basically is, well, your daughter was a drug addict. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=546.0s)]
*  Oh, your daughter was a drug addict. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=552.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry for your loss, but your daughter was a drug addict. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=554.0s)]
*  Don't blame us. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=557.0s)]
*  Hammer the abusers. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=558.0s)]
*  And that was literally said out loud or written down like that was the strategy. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=560.0s)]
*  And to blame abuse on addict addicts and to say anyone who has a problem with Oxycontin, it's not our fault. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=565.0s)]
*  They're just drug addicts. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=576.0s)]
*  It's not our fault. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=578.0s)]
*  You know, we gave. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=579.0s)]
*  Yeah, we gave them heroin. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=580.0s)]
*  But they're at. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=581.0s)]
*  Hammer on the abusers. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=583.0s)]
*  Mass Attorney General alleges Purdue Pharma tried to shift blame for opioid addiction. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=584.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=590.0s)]
*  So think about that. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=591.0s)]
*  Think about you being the parent. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=592.0s)]
*  And if you see the show, we open each episode with a parent. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=594.0s)]
*  You know, we were told right when I got ready to lock the show, I got I had to get on a zoom with all the legal, you know, from Netflix and others, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=599.0s)]
*  because the Sacklers are really good at lawyers. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=609.0s)]
*  You know, Giuliani was was one of their main attorneys, Mary Jo White. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=612.0s)]
*  I don't know if you know she is. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=617.0s)]
*  She's a very powerful attorney and others. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=619.0s)]
*  So they there's a lot of fear about being sued. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=622.0s)]
*  You know, I have my talking points here. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=626.0s)]
*  I'm not supposed to say. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=629.0s)]
*  So, again, everything I'm saying is stuff has been proven. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=631.0s)]
*  You know, more or less my theory and things that have been backed up by books like Painkiller by the very talented Barry Meyer, who wrote Investigative Reporter for the Times, who wrote it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=636.0s)]
*  But we were told by legal that we had to put disclaimers in front of each episode. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=646.0s)]
*  You know, what you're about to see is based on fact, but some of the facts have been changed. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=653.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's not all true. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=657.0s)]
*  We've changed some of the facts. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=660.0s)]
*  And that didn't really sit right with me because, yes, we have interpreted things and changed some things. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=663.0s)]
*  But the reality is the Sacklers did what they did. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=668.0s)]
*  And I didn't I thought like just putting a standard disclaimer would be kind of letting them off a bit. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=672.0s)]
*  And I was thinking about it. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=678.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, what if we had a 50 year old woman sitting, we open the show, 50 year old woman staring at the camera and she reads the disclaimer exactly as legal says, you know, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=679.0s)]
*  what you see is based on fact, but some of it has been fictionalized. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=691.0s)]
*  And then she stops and she says, but what hasn't been fictionalized is that my 22 year old son, Tommy, and she holds up a picture, died of an Oxycontin overdose. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=695.0s)]
*  And that was, you know, the kind of thing that was, I think, very important to me and to all the makers of the show that as if we were going to veer from the truth [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=705.0s)]
*  and we were going to potentially occur the wrath of the Purdue legal, we did it in a way that never let them off the hook. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=720.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=729.0s)]
*  It's it's so weird how many people are on it. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=732.0s)]
*  I had a conversation with a friend of mine about his mom, his mom's 90. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=739.0s)]
*  And, you know, she's had health issues. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=744.0s)]
*  But could you imagine when we were kids, if you told me that your friend's mom was on heroin and that we had to get her more heroin and the doctor's not there's something wrong with her prescription. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=748.0s)]
*  So what had happened was the pharmacist, the doctor had screwed up and prescribed more pills verbally than he wrote it down on paper. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=761.0s)]
*  Like he told her you have to take two a day, you know, and this is supposed to be good for, you know, whatever it is, 30, 60 days. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=770.0s)]
*  But he wrote the wrong number. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=777.0s)]
*  He instead of like 180, he wrote 90 or something. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=779.0s)]
*  I don't remember what the mistake was. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=783.0s)]
*  He overprescribed by accident. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=784.0s)]
*  He underprescribed by accident. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=785.0s)]
*  And so they were thinking someone was stealing her pills. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=787.0s)]
*  So there was this like she doesn't have enough. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=789.0s)]
*  Like it gets to the end of the month and she's out of pills and they're calling the doctor and the doctor's like what's going on? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=793.0s)]
*  They're like, I don't know what's happening. Is someone stealing her pills? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=798.0s)]
*  So there's this fear in the house that someone's stealing the pills. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=801.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=804.0s)]
*  So they figured out that's not what the case was. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=805.0s)]
*  The case was there was just a mistake. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=807.0s)]
*  The doctor inadvertently prescribed more in terms of take three a day every day or two a day every day. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=808.0s)]
*  But he just didn't give her enough pills to do that. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=814.0s)]
*  But it's but you imagine your 90 year old mom is Joneson because that's what's going on. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=817.0s)]
*  I mean, imagine you like I got a great grandma heroin. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=823.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=825.0s)]
*  Hey, bro, you want to come with me? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=826.0s)]
*  Do you have your gun? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=827.0s)]
*  You're going to get grandma heroin. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=828.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like, are you fucking crazy? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=829.0s)]
*  Imagine that thought. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=831.0s)]
*  No one would think that that when we were kids, no one would think that was normal. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=833.0s)]
*  Mike, I got to get my grandma heroin. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=836.0s)]
*  She's uncomfortable. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=838.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=840.0s)]
*  And one of one of the things that I think like episode three or four, the patriarch of the Sackler family, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=841.0s)]
*  Arthur Sackler, who started got the whole ball rolling. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=849.0s)]
*  And he you know, back in the day, they actually did prescribe heroin. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=853.0s)]
*  We found all these great old ads for heroin in cough syrup, cocaine for, you know, a fever. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=857.0s)]
*  And well, codeine used to be in cough syrup. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=867.0s)]
*  Right. Used to be able to get when I was a kid. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=871.0s)]
*  You still can get it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=873.0s)]
*  Yeah. But there were literally ads that said heroin for a cough. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=874.0s)]
*  And like the whole history of how medicine started being marketed and heroin. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=878.0s)]
*  Look at that. Bear pharmaceutical products. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=885.0s)]
*  The people who brought you aspirin. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=889.0s)]
*  And if you look up some of the old see if you can find the look at it, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=891.0s)]
*  we kind of describe it, the cheapest specific for the relief of coughs. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=897.0s)]
*  Right. So this was real. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=901.0s)]
*  This is real shit. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=903.0s)]
*  And this is what, you know, doctors like Arthur Sackler, who was Richard Sackler's uncle and is, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=905.0s)]
*  you know, arguably the godfather of Oxycontin and opioids. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=911.0s)]
*  They were they were sending this stuff out. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=917.0s)]
*  Your child's having trouble sleeping. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=920.0s)]
*  Put a little liquid morphine on a blanket and let him suck on it. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=922.0s)]
*  This was happening like our grandparents were around for this. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=926.0s)]
*  Oh, my cocaine tooth drops. You see that? Look at that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=930.0s)]
*  That's insane. But that's real. Oh, my God. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=933.0s)]
*  Instantaneous cure. You don't give a fuck about your teeth. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=936.0s)]
*  You're trying to start a business. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=939.0s)]
*  Or you're 12 and you're just being annoying because your tooth hurts. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=941.0s)]
*  Your parents just give you a bunch of blow. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=945.0s)]
*  Yeah. So crazy. Stay fit and slim by taking amphetamine. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=947.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. It's so crazy how how naive people were back then. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=951.0s)]
*  But still today. Right. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=957.0s)]
*  And like so so the catchphrase for Oxycontin that that Richard Sackler came up with was Oxycontin. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=959.0s)]
*  The one to start with, the one to stay with. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=965.0s)]
*  And those were the ads. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=968.0s)]
*  And that's what the cute little 23 year old graduates from Ohio State or Duke or wherever they were from. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=970.0s)]
*  These cute girls would come into your office. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=977.0s)]
*  You're you're a doctor in some Midwestern town. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=979.0s)]
*  And then comes this beautiful girl with a with a brochure that says Oxycontin, the one to start with, the one to stay with. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=983.0s)]
*  And you've never heard of it. So you just start. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=990.0s)]
*  You know, and here's the thing about Oxycontin. Have you ever taken an Oxycontin? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=993.0s)]
*  No. I took it once recreationally. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=997.0s)]
*  Did you do it before you started doing this? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1002.0s)]
*  Yes. I did about, I don't know, eight years ago. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  A friend of mine had one and she's like, you got to try this. Jesus Christ. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1007.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, try anything once. Right. Try it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  Took it. It was fantastic. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. It was like it was like being dropped in a vat of warm honey. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  That's how I best describe it. And I'm like, holy shit. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1026.0s)]
*  Get this away from me. Right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1031.0s)]
*  Like it's it works. Yeah. Heroin works. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  Yeah. We've talked to people who've done heroin and they describe the feeling, the actual moment of the high. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  OK. Yes, it's a it's a powerful experience. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1043.0s)]
*  If you've got horrific pain and you take an Oxycontin or a fentanyl, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  it's probably going to make that pain go away and you're going to feel really good for a little while. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1053.0s)]
*  Right. For a little while. And then you're you're not going to feel so good. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1059.0s)]
*  You know, I and then you're going to want it again and you're going to want again and again. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1063.0s)]
*  And then your body becomes addicted to it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1067.0s)]
*  And then it's not fun. And and I, you know, took it and recognize, OK, yeah, there's there's a lot of power [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1069.0s)]
*  in this little pill. No, thank you. And and I'm fortunate I don't have an addictive gene, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  but I could easily see how and look, the Sacklers knew this. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  They know they all knew how powerful that that product was. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1089.0s)]
*  And they knew that if I put it in you, you're going to feel as they say, as Richard Sackler says, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  life is about running away from pain towards pleasure. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  If you feel pain, that's right. The human condition is we want to stay away from pain. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  Yeah. Anything to feel no pain and to feel good. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1109.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so he knew he had this miracle because any pain, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1113.0s)]
*  whether it's physical, emotional, you know, psychic pain that you're feeling, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1117.0s)]
*  this little pill is going to turn that off and you're going to feel like you've been dropped into a vat of warm honey for a little while. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  And then that honey starts to turn into battery acid and it starts to like burn. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  I think it's funny that people make fun of people who believe in demons because what would a demon do? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1138.0s)]
*  If you if you were a demonic entity and you wanted to steal lives and souls, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  would you just go around just pulling people out of their house with a pitchfork and being like obvious about it? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  Would you do it through a really evil sociopathic person who decides that they're just going to manipulate this system and ruin countless lives? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1161.0s)]
*  I mean, how many people have been affected by this? I don't know what the numbers are. Do you? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1174.0s)]
*  Millions. I mean, how many people have died from half from from opioids? Six hundred thousand. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1178.0s)]
*  But but that's like war numbers. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  Of course, it is a war. It is. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1189.0s)]
*  You can look at opioids as an absolute war. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1192.0s)]
*  Much, much higher body count than Ukraine, Afghanistan and Iraq, you know, added up. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  Although I don't I don't know what the full Ukraine body count numbers are. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1203.0s)]
*  When we were kids, it was very rare that someone died of a heroin overdose and there was always a lost soul. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1206.0s)]
*  It was always like some wild musician or some crazy poet. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1212.0s)]
*  Someone is like, God, he died of heroin. Like, that's so crazy. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1217.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. It's like heroin was reserved for the people that were just not coming back. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1220.0s)]
*  You know, every now and then someone would do cocaine or something like that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1227.0s)]
*  And if you had a wild friend, he didn't knew how to get mushrooms. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  But heroin, nobody was like, let's go try heroin. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  But now when you look at those numbers from the introduction of Oxycontin and to now, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  how many people have died from that compound? It's fucking insane. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. It is really dark. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1247.0s)]
*  And and then, you know, something else we talk about in the show is, yes, the deaths are very high, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1249.0s)]
*  but the amount of families that have been wrecked and destroyed and children who've lost parents [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  and had to grow up with that kind of trauma. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  You know, I have friends whose children have gotten hooked and tangled up in opioids. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  And, you know, as a father, one of one of my biggest, biggest fears was, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1272.0s)]
*  God forbid, my child should ever experience addiction because I've seen what that does to a parent [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1280.0s)]
*  to have to ride that that chaotic roller coaster of childhood drug addiction [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1286.0s)]
*  and try everything you can to keep your kid safe and find that this pill has taken a hold of their soul. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1292.0s)]
*  Like you say, like a demon. And, you know, sometimes death is almost preferred. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1299.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's so fucked up. That's what's so fucked up. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1306.0s)]
*  That that, you know, that brings peace. Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1309.0s)]
*  And that there's that's so terrible to even think it's it's so terrible. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1312.0s)]
*  It's it's true, though, that the the chaos of dealing with someone and it's not just look, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  it's not just Oxycontin, any addiction. Right. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1322.0s)]
*  You know, I have many friends who've struggled with alcoholism and, you know, other addictions. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1325.0s)]
*  Just trying to love somebody who's going through that kind of beast ride is is just horrific. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1330.0s)]
*  And to think that people like the Sacklers were in the business of monetizing such hurt and pain. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1342.0s)]
*  That's that's dark. It's very, very dark. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1350.0s)]
*  And kind of ironically, because of the war on drugs, because so many drugs are illegal. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1354.0s)]
*  Now people are dying from fentanyl from things that are not supposed to have opioids in them. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1359.0s)]
*  Yeah. Which is even more insane because now people have this. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1364.0s)]
*  I don't want to say a taste for it, but it's it's it's so common. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1369.0s)]
*  Like if like opioids are so common in this country and recreationally now because of Oxycontin. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1372.0s)]
*  And then you've got like people try to buy like street Xanax. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  It has fentanyl in it or street cocaine has. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  We lost a bunch of comics in L.A. recently. Oh, I heard that. Yeah. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  In Venice. Right. Yeah. I don't know where it was. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  I didn't know. They were like having a little house party and doing some coke recreationally. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1395.0s)]
*  And it was fentanyl in it. And they all died. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  It's fucking one person survived. But the whole thing is fucking insane. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1402.0s)]
*  Right. It's so insane that it's it's so so common. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1406.0s)]
*  It's so common to hear about someone overdosing from fentanyl. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1410.0s)]
*  You read about it in the news. It's in the news all the time. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1415.0s)]
*  Athletes, singers, you know, someone fucks up and takes the wrong dose and they're dead. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1417.0s)]
*  And I believe what happened with Tom Petty was he got off stage and I think he had some sort of an injury and he got a pill from one of the guys was like a sound guy. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1423.0s)]
*  And it had fentanyl in it. And it had fentanyl in it. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1433.0s)]
*  So, I mean, people are so desperate. They'll take they'll take some stuff that's not even from the pharmacy. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  They just need it. And that a family was able to make so much money. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  How much money did they make in total? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1448.0s)]
*  If you if you Google their value, it's between 10 and 20 billion reported. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  Nobody knows exactly how much they're really secretive family. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  One of the most Internet scrubbed families and Richard Sackler in particular, people I've ever encountered, you just can get very little information on them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1459.0s)]
*  But, you know, and the other, I think, big part of the story that that surprised me was the FDA. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1469.0s)]
*  Right. And the FDA's role in in opioid approvals. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  And in the case of OxyContin, you know, we think about like the FDA is this big, giant bureaucratic organization. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1483.0s)]
*  And, you know, you think we were talking about stem cells a little bit earlier. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  That if you want to get an approval for a drug, you know, and well, OK, you got to send it to the FDA and it's going to be reviewed by this massive board of scientists and experts. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  And they're going to make a determination after careful analysis. Right. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  That's not how it works. And in the case of OxyContin, the whole approval process came down to this one guy, this guy named Curtis Wright. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1509.0s)]
*  And Curtis Wright, when the Purdue Pharma needed the FDA to approve, they'd spent 30 million bucks developing this drug. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1518.0s)]
*  The whole business of drug developing is fascinating. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  But they were all in and they needed this drug to keep the company alive. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1531.0s)]
*  They needed the FDA to approve it. And this guy was like, I can't approve this. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  This is heroin in a pill. No. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  No. Well, and they kept trying to get him to approve it and they kept trying to get and they started trying to like pump his ego up. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  They started writing articles with them. They started trying to, you know, schmooze him and charm him. He wouldn't approve it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  Finally, and no one knows the facts, they took him to a hotel on the East Coast. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1556.0s)]
*  Purdue Pharma took Curtis Wright to the FDA, spent a couple of days in this hotel room. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1562.0s)]
*  They came out of the hotel room with an approval with the language OxyContin, quote, is believed to be non addictive, is believed. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1567.0s)]
*  If you think about that language, it had never been used in an approval process before ever. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1577.0s)]
*  Made no sense. Is believed. Not is not, but is believed to not be addictive. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1582.0s)]
*  A year later, he leaves the FDA, which is making probably 50 grand a year. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1588.0s)]
*  Where does he go work? Purdue Pharma for 400 plus thousand dollars a year. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1593.0s)]
*  They bought the approval. But the two days in the hotel, what the fuck did they do? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  Nobody agrees to stay in a hotel for two days. So I wrote a scene in painkiller. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1607.0s)]
*  We were putting it together where we imagined what happened in that hotel. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1614.0s)]
*  And I had like everything from monkeys to like kickboxing, Thai kickboxing, massage parlors to like everything. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1620.0s)]
*  And like I wanted to film the most debaucherous two day, like anything your mind could think of, like the craziest of the cra- [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1632.0s)]
*  Water sports. All of it. All of it. Like jet water sports. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1641.0s)]
*  Like they spray your house down with sand blasting. Like just the crazy. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  And we wrote it like this just Faustian orgy of absolute decadence. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1655.0s)]
*  And the lawyers called and they're like, are you fucking kidding? We can't do this. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1661.0s)]
*  So we just shut the door. Oh, wow. And we go, I think it's episode three that that's it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  But he took a job. I mean, like I was saying earlier, I'm not big on conspiracies. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1672.0s)]
*  Maybe, maybe not. I heard you were talking about, you know, Kennedy being potentially killed by the CIA. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1680.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know who killed him. But I do think that it wasn't just Lee Harvey Oswald. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  What couldn't have been? I think Lee Harvey Oswald was involved, too. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1692.0s)]
*  That's part of the problem with people's argument about this. They're like, you know, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1695.0s)]
*  There's no evidence that he acted alone. There's a lot of evidence that he was involved. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1701.0s)]
*  When I was in fifth grade, we had a social studies teacher who was absolutely like beyond before Oliver Stone in the film. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1705.0s)]
*  This teacher was obsessed with the Super Bullet Theory, right? The magic. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1716.0s)]
*  The Magic Bullet Theory, you know, went through Connelly's shoulder, through his knee, bounced out of his knee, then hit Kennedy. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1720.0s)]
*  No, hit Kennedy first. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1729.0s)]
*  Okay, hit Kennedy first. And then it was Connelly, right? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1730.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1733.0s)]
*  Connelly's shoulder, hand, knee. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1734.0s)]
*  And wrist. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  Right. And like, and we're like, we're just fifth grade kids trying to like, you know, learn about George Washington or whatever. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1736.0s)]
*  And she's like, do you understand the ballistics? Don't line up. And it's all she would talk about. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1742.0s)]
*  So we'd come home and it's all we would talk about with our parents. And our parents would like call the school and be like, like, is this woman like this teacher? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  Like, what's she insane? Like, why are my kids only learning about the magic bullet? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  See, the thing is the ballistics are not the big issue because what people don't understand about ballistics is not a linear line between impact and exit. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1763.0s)]
*  It hits things. You hit bones and they deviate. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1773.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1776.0s)]
*  People shoot people and the bullet comes out the front. It's wild things, especially when you're 22. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  But when the problem with that bullet is, first of all, they found it on the gurney. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  Like how fucking convenient. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1788.0s)]
*  Second of all, I believe there's more fragments, metal fragments that were in Connelly's wrist than are missing from this bullet. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1791.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  And the bullet looks pristine. It looks like a bullet that you shot through water. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1799.0s)]
*  Anybody that shoots things with guns knows that when bullets hit bones, they distort. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1803.0s)]
*  That's that's part of unless it's a steel jacketed, you know, like armor piercing round. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  That's what it looked like. I mean, that's just bonkers. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1815.0s)]
*  That was like what it looked like after it went through Kennedy and Connelly. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  It's bonkers. It's bonkers to believe that. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1822.0s)]
*  Yeah. The idea that he wasn't that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't involved, though. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1825.0s)]
*  I don't buy that either. I think I think they set him up. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1829.0s)]
*  I think for sure he knew what was going on. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1832.0s)]
*  He seemed to have been some sort of an operative. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1835.0s)]
*  He went back and forth to Russia. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1838.0s)]
*  There's a lot. But that conspiracy, it's like, I don't know. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1841.0s)]
*  We're talking 1963. I don't you know. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1844.0s)]
*  But there's conspiracies today that are real. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1847.0s)]
*  And this Sackler family is one of the best examples of one that was enormously successful and worked on multiple levels. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1851.0s)]
*  And this story about getting this regulator to approve it by putting him in a hotel for two weeks. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1861.0s)]
*  How the fuck is that not illegal? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  Like, how is that not illegal? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1869.0s)]
*  I mean, they they handle themselves. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1872.0s)]
*  He spent a year still working for the FDA went before he came and worked for Purdue. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1875.0s)]
*  And it's pretty intense. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  I just saw a video that I don't know whether it was TMZ or somebody found the guy that Curtis Wright up in. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1886.0s)]
*  I think he's in New Hampshire just like two days ago. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1894.0s)]
*  And they like they kind of went after him. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  And I was like, they're like, what do you say? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1900.0s)]
*  What do you have to say about the show? What do you think? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1902.0s)]
*  And he got in his car and wouldn't talk. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1905.0s)]
*  And then they just interviewed the local police chief for this town in New Hampshire, who said, well, we had no idea that this this guy's living in our town. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1909.0s)]
*  So we had to take him on a tour of our morgue and our cemeteries and show him show him. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1919.0s)]
*  I think you'll find Curtis Wright, if you look him up, that is the definition of living in hell. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1927.0s)]
*  Yeah. And now and that's. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1933.0s)]
*  You know, I think that people have asked, you know, like, what what is justice? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1937.0s)]
*  What does justice even look like in a situation like this? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1943.0s)]
*  I think if you're that's the guy in the red that yeah. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  So that's you know, who plays him. And that was just that's the actual that's the actual gentleman who approved it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1950.0s)]
*  That's the guy who was went and worked for. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1957.0s)]
*  So he just moved to a remote town, moved to a remote town. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1960.0s)]
*  And after it came out, I think it's not a gun on his hip. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1964.0s)]
*  I don't think so. I tried. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1968.0s)]
*  What is that? I took a flashlight. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1970.0s)]
*  He's got like a rig. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1972.0s)]
*  He's got this phone in the front. Yeah, he's got a whole vibe going on and a passport filled with trips to Thailand probably. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  Right. But, you know, like that's that's that's the face of a big part of the issue that, you know, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1982.0s)]
*  this guy was a bureaucrat working for the FDA, living his life in the East Coast. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1992.0s)]
*  Someone came along and said, hey, you want to get out of here? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=1999.0s)]
*  You're making 50 grand to say that you believe this to be less addictive. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2002.0s)]
*  That'll get us the approval and you're good. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  We're going to make you good. And here we are. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2012.0s)]
*  And that revolving door still exists today. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2016.0s)]
*  The people go from the FDA right into pharmaceutical companies today. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2018.0s)]
*  For sure. And it's so weird that that's legal. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2023.0s)]
*  And another big part of the game are these medical journals. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2026.0s)]
*  Right. Like there's something called the New England Journal of Medicine. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2029.0s)]
*  And like a big thing is for a doctor in a new in some of these in these journals are owned by the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2033.0s)]
*  Right. So think about it. You own Purdue Pharma. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2041.0s)]
*  You either buy or control medical journals that write favorable articles about your products, about your drugs. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2044.0s)]
*  So in the case of OxyContin, there was a small, small like almost a letter to the editor written about OxyContin being less than one percent addictive in a medical journal, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2052.0s)]
*  which sounds like official and like, OK, well, damn, Joe is in the medical journal. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2066.0s)]
*  Right. Let's go. But these are controlled by drug companies and they're not legit. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  It's fake news. It's real fake news. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2078.0s)]
*  And it's all part of the ecosystem of selling drugs. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2080.0s)]
*  And these are the big drug dealers. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  Like we talk about Chappell or Pablo Escobar, you know, Eric Newman, my buddy who was the exec producer on this, he produced Narcos and went deep on Pablo Escobar. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2089.0s)]
*  And he's like, when he when he first said you want to do this, he's like, these are the real drug dealers. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2100.0s)]
*  Like, like these are the these are the drug dealers putting up the real numbers. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2106.0s)]
*  And they're the drug dealers who put their name on museums like the Metropolitan, the Guggenheim, the Louvre in Paris. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2111.0s)]
*  These are like these are the big time hard hitting drug dealers. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2118.0s)]
*  They're real gangsters. Oh, they're fucking gangsters, man. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2123.0s)]
*  It's such a gangster move to put your name everywhere, too, especially on like education institutions. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2126.0s)]
*  Have you ever been in the in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts Temple of Dender, the giant glass, the biggest exhibit in the Met in New York City? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2133.0s)]
*  And that was the Sackler Wing. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2144.0s)]
*  And I would go in there when we were making the show and I was this giant. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2146.0s)]
*  It's it's it's on the north side of the Met. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2152.0s)]
*  It's it's a massive wing. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2156.0s)]
*  And you go in there, it says the Sackler Wing and you go in there and there's parents running around with their kids. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2159.0s)]
*  The last time I saw a guy get on his hands and knees and propose. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2164.0s)]
*  And it's just this happy, joyful room built on Oxycontin. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2167.0s)]
*  And two, three months ago, they took the name down. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2173.0s)]
*  They finally took the name down. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2177.0s)]
*  Finally? After all these years? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2179.0s)]
*  Yeah, so they've taken and this is the thing that like what Arthur Sackler cared more about than anything, which is like the same as Alfred Nobel, right? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2181.0s)]
*  You know that Alfred Nobel made dynamite. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2191.0s)]
*  That's how he made his money. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2193.0s)]
*  It was a fascinating story that Nobel was was the inventor of dynamite. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2196.0s)]
*  It's almost like an Oppenheimer situation. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2201.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2203.0s)]
*  And the story is that someone ran a false obituary. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2204.0s)]
*  They thought he died and they called him a merchant of death. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2209.0s)]
*  The great merchant of death is gone. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2212.0s)]
*  This guy, Nobel, who invented dynamite. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2214.0s)]
*  And at that moment, he realized, fuck, this is how I'm going to be known. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2217.0s)]
*  This is going to be my legacy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  The merchant of death. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2222.0s)]
*  He took a huge chunk of his fortune and started the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2223.0s)]
*  So when you hear the name Nobel, you don't think about dynamite, right? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2228.0s)]
*  He invented dynamite, hand grenades and howitzer rounds and munitions. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2233.0s)]
*  That was all Nobel. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2239.0s)]
*  Now you just say, oh, my God, Barack Obama just won the Dalai Lama just won the Martin Luther King. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2241.0s)]
*  And when this guy made it off a dynamite, that's insane. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2246.0s)]
*  And so the Sacklers were like the same thing. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2251.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2254.0s)]
*  We know what we're selling here. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2255.0s)]
*  We know where our money is coming from. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2256.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2259.0s)]
*  Merchant of death to pioneer of Nobel Prize. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2260.0s)]
*  That the Nobel Peace Prize was a big bait and switch. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2263.0s)]
*  So nobody thought about the fact that this dude, you know, go look at the body kind of Vietnam. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  And this is interesting. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2274.0s)]
*  He said many saw his invention with Alfred thought would end all wars, just like Oppenheimer, as a highly lethal product. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2276.0s)]
*  When Alfred's brother Ludwig died in 1888, a French newspaper accidentally published an obituary for Alfred [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2282.0s)]
*  that referred to him as the merchant of death. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2287.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2292.0s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2293.0s)]
*  I did not. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2294.0s)]
*  That's a mind blower. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2295.0s)]
*  But it makes sense because that's how evil fucks are. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2297.0s)]
*  They'll try to cover up what they're doing with humanitarian work. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2301.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2304.0s)]
*  And that's what the Sacklers did. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2305.0s)]
*  Very like, OK, we're selling heroin and pills. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2307.0s)]
*  Hold the word like 300. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2310.0s)]
*  We're up to 300,000 deaths and a lot of wreck families. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2313.0s)]
*  Let's buy some art. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2317.0s)]
*  Let's put let's let's donate to multiple medical schools. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2319.0s)]
*  Get our names on medical schools all around the country. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2324.0s)]
*  Let's throw a name up on the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim, the Louvre in Paris. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2327.0s)]
*  They were putting their names on anything they could. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2335.0s)]
*  The bridge in London that one of the Sacklers, the Sackler Bridge, like just anything to take your eye off the ball. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2338.0s)]
*  And so to me, you know, whether they end up paying six billion or 16 billion. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2346.0s)]
*  Yeah, that that that's real. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2352.0s)]
*  That that's deserve money. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2355.0s)]
*  But I think the bigger issue is the name. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2356.0s)]
*  The evisceration of the name has is is is in deep process right now. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2360.0s)]
*  As it should be. Yes. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2368.0s)]
*  And I just wonder how they're going to get away with it without paying criminal penalties. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2370.0s)]
*  I mean, not just criminal penalties, but like going to jail. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2374.0s)]
*  It's hard to go to jail today if you've got a lot of money, Joe. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2378.0s)]
*  That's insane. Yeah. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2381.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a jet. I don't I can't imagine the Sacklers going to jail. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2383.0s)]
*  But I think worse than jail is the fact that the name is now. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  Done. Yeah. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2396.0s)]
*  And that hurts because this this was a family that was all about the legacy. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2398.0s)]
*  And that's over. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2403.0s)]
*  This guy that approved it was his name again. Curtis. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2405.0s)]
*  Right. They found imagine being that guy because you didn't even get rich. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2409.0s)]
*  You know, you got kind of rich. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2414.0s)]
*  You made a lot of money, but you didn't get like billionaire. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2416.0s)]
*  I can just go hide on an island, Rich. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2419.0s)]
*  You're in a small town in New Hampshire and then they find you when this this year the series comes out. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2421.0s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't I never know, like someone's morality. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2427.0s)]
*  Like I always have trouble like understanding how different people process morality and like what it would mean for because you got to assume a guy like that after, you know, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2433.0s)]
*  25 years has figured out a way of justifying to himself what he's done. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2445.0s)]
*  Right. Like we all do that. Like, I mean, we justify our behaviors. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2450.0s)]
*  We don't engage in behavior like that. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2455.0s)]
*  But we whatever we do, we justify it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2457.0s)]
*  And I wonder how much it hurts. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2460.0s)]
*  You know, like we tried to contact Richard Sackler several times during the early. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2463.0s)]
*  He used to live here in Austin and we couldn't find him. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2468.0s)]
*  He has a house here in Austin still. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2473.0s)]
*  But how how it feels, you know, there's never been a moment where there's been any kind of accountability where, you know, Richard Sackler comes out and says, OK, OK, look, I am really fucking sorry. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2475.0s)]
*  Let's just start with that. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2492.0s)]
*  I am so sorry that this has happened. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2494.0s)]
*  I'm so sorry for the pain. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2497.0s)]
*  Like and I can't undo it, but I want to first acknowledge that I'm sorry. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2500.0s)]
*  I made some really bad decisions. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2505.0s)]
*  I thought I thought I was helping people. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2507.0s)]
*  I wasn't. I didn't. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2510.0s)]
*  There was never been. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2511.0s)]
*  And I think that's where the anger comes from. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2513.0s)]
*  So much of it. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2515.0s)]
*  Do you think that that that's because of legal advice? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2516.0s)]
*  I mean, even if he was, I don't think you could admit that you're sorry. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2520.0s)]
*  His situation is horrendous as this because I think it opens up the floodgates for further scrutiny. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2525.0s)]
*  I guess I just yes, you're probably right. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  But I guess I feel like like you've already you've lost. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2533.0s)]
*  You've lost. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2539.0s)]
*  You've lost so much and you've lost so much money. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2540.0s)]
*  Your reputation is is destroyed. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2544.0s)]
*  If you look at there's like a 12 hour disposition deposition of Sackler that that we recreate some of in the show. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  And the guy is just a fucking ice brick. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2558.0s)]
*  Like he offers nothing. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2563.0s)]
*  There's no humanity there. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2565.0s)]
*  And obviously his lawyers were advising him. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2567.0s)]
*  Yes. And he can't say a lot. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2569.0s)]
*  But you want to you want to believe that everyone's human. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2571.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like you want to see some version of like, OK, can I understand how it happened? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2575.0s)]
*  Do I think they set out to have all this death and destruction? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2582.0s)]
*  I must say, no, I don't know. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2586.0s)]
*  But I have to believe that they didn't intend for that. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2588.0s)]
*  Then the ball got rolling. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2592.0s)]
*  Then the money started coming in. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2594.0s)]
*  Then it all got completely out of control. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2595.0s)]
*  And by the time they realized how bad it was, they couldn't apologize, obviously. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2598.0s)]
*  And and they they were they were boxed in by legal advice. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2604.0s)]
*  But somewhere you're looking for some indication of like, look, ma'am, I am so sorry your son died. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2608.0s)]
*  Not not I'm sorry your son died, but your son was a drug addict. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2615.0s)]
*  An instant deflection. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2621.0s)]
*  Right. That's just like that's rough. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2623.0s)]
*  That's rough. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2626.0s)]
*  It is rough. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2628.0s)]
*  It's just again, it's it's hard to understand the way certain people function, their morals, like what what are their ethics and are they sociopaths? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2629.0s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people that are genuine sociopaths. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2639.0s)]
*  They do not care if other people are hurt. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2642.0s)]
*  They do not care about people's feelings. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2644.0s)]
*  They only care about themselves. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2645.0s)]
*  There are people like that out there in the world and they're amongst us. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2647.0s)]
*  And I don't know what the number is. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2650.0s)]
*  I think it's like one percent or something like that. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2652.0s)]
*  Is it something like that or is that schizophrenics? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2654.0s)]
*  I think sociopaths is probably even higher than that. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2657.0s)]
*  Like and some of it is got to be because how you were treated when you were young. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2659.0s)]
*  Some of it is got to be nurture. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2664.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2666.0s)]
*  But I wonder how much of his nature. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2667.0s)]
*  I wonder how much of his your wires are crossed wrong. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2668.0s)]
*  And you just don't give a fuck about other people. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2671.0s)]
*  It's totally possible. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2673.0s)]
*  I mean, you look at like Jeffrey Dahmer, his parents seem to be normal. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2675.0s)]
*  They didn't seem to abuse him. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2679.0s)]
*  He didn't have like some horrific childhood where he was, you know, tortured. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2681.0s)]
*  It's like what makes a person like that? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2685.0s)]
*  I don't fucking know, man. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2687.0s)]
*  But when you see it, it's so confusing. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2689.0s)]
*  Like that Sackler guy in your show, it's like when you're watching him say what he says, like, how does a person like this exist? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2692.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2699.0s)]
*  And, you know, like obviously Dahmer is a fairly extreme example of. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2700.0s)]
*  But is it because he only killed like six or seven people? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2705.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2707.0s)]
*  I just mean that. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2708.0s)]
*  But he really like put his hands on those people. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2709.0s)]
*  So that the idea of a serial killer is such an extreme. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2712.0s)]
*  Real, but extreme version of that. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2716.0s)]
*  But like how many times do you kind of come across someone who's maybe not killing people or engaged in a lethal career? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2719.0s)]
*  But you're like, whoa, that dude doesn't seem reachable. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2729.0s)]
*  I don't I don't know what's going on there. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2732.0s)]
*  Like I'm trying to have some sort of human connection. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2734.0s)]
*  But this dude is just like, you know, and I've met. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2738.0s)]
*  I've met many people generally who organize their lives strictly around making money. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2741.0s)]
*  Like money is money is the prize. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2749.0s)]
*  Money is the art. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2751.0s)]
*  And I kind of I'm like, hello? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2753.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very weird nonhuman. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2759.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2760.0s)]
*  It's like I'm about making money and my morality and, you know, sense of humanity is just not very readily apparent. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2761.0s)]
*  And I think that that's like on a spectrum, not that not necessarily that far removed from something that could turn into a Jeffrey Dahmer. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2771.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not that far. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2783.0s)]
*  I mean, do you ever like study Putin and try and figure out what's going on in that guy's head? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2785.0s)]
*  I could only imagine. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2789.0s)]
*  Like, I think it was Bush who said, you know, he had just come back from meeting Putin years ago. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2791.0s)]
*  And he said, you know, I looked into his eyes and I didn't see a soul. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2798.0s)]
*  And I remember that guy was younger when he said that. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2802.0s)]
*  But it chilled me like in Bush. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2804.0s)]
*  Look, this is Bush, too. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2806.0s)]
*  And he's like, I looked into his eyes and I didn't see a soul. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2808.0s)]
*  If you pull that quote up, that's crazy. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2812.0s)]
*  I hope I said it right. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2815.0s)]
*  Oh, the opposite. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2818.0s)]
*  I looked a man in the eye I found to be very straightforward and trustworthy, Bush said. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2820.0s)]
*  I was able to get a sense of his soul. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2824.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, he got it or he didn't get it. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2826.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2829.0s)]
*  I'm so glad we searched that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2830.0s)]
*  Yeah, I am too. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2832.0s)]
*  Because I was confused. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2833.0s)]
*  I could have swore it was the opposite. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2834.0s)]
*  Well, OK, I was wrong about that one. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2835.0s)]
*  But then he said he later. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2837.0s)]
*  But he said he regretted it because he was wrong. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2839.0s)]
*  He thought he saw a soul, but he didn't. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2841.0s)]
*  He said that later. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2843.0s)]
*  Well, that's what he said, right? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2844.0s)]
*  He said he regret pull it back up. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2845.0s)]
*  I think he said I thought I saw I thought I saw a soul in 95. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2847.0s)]
*  Bush later regretted saying this. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2853.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2855.0s)]
*  How about that? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2856.0s)]
*  Bush later regretted regretted saying this. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2857.0s)]
*  Ninety five met with Putin. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2859.0s)]
*  So he thought he saw a soul, Joe, but he didn't. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2860.0s)]
*  That's what he came to believe. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2863.0s)]
*  What does he say later? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2864.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2866.0s)]
*  Try. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2869.0s)]
*  He just said he's regretted it. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2870.0s)]
*  According to. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2872.0s)]
*  I was not able to get a sense of his soul. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2873.0s)]
*  I did not see the relentless ambition when I looked into Putin [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2877.0s)]
*  looked Putin in the eye 27 years ago. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2880.0s)]
*  But then I was not able to get a sense of his soul. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2882.0s)]
*  OK, I think that's the line that stuck with me. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2885.0s)]
*  I was not able to get a sense of his soul. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2887.0s)]
*  Well, he doesn't speak Russian either. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2889.0s)]
*  That's got to be hard. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2891.0s)]
*  Just talking to someone in two different languages is extremely have you been to Moscow? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2893.0s)]
*  No, I have not. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2898.0s)]
*  The architecture is insane. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2899.0s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2900.0s)]
*  I've been there twice. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2901.0s)]
*  Russia is incredible. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2902.0s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2903.0s)]
*  And like one of the many things that's like sucks about this, I think, is like Moscow's [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2904.0s)]
*  just out now for for such a long time and for a long time. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2910.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2914.0s)]
*  And I've gone there twice for for film promotions and the people were so nice. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2915.0s)]
*  The food was fantastic. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2922.0s)]
*  The architecture. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2925.0s)]
*  I mean, walking through Red Square. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2926.0s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2927.0s)]
*  I loved the culture. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2928.0s)]
*  And it's too bad. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2930.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is too bad. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2933.0s)]
*  I would hope I hope one day to be able to go back there. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2934.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2937.0s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing how many great chess players, how many great martial artists, how [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2939.0s)]
*  many great authors Russia's produced some incredible things, incredible works. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2945.0s)]
*  And the architecture in Russia is so different than anywhere else. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2950.0s)]
*  The Moscow architecture is so beautiful and so unique, uniquely Russian. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2955.0s)]
*  You know, it's really fantastic stuff. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2961.0s)]
*  I mean, but it's like the political aspect of it's so terrifying, man, that we're this [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2963.0s)]
*  close to a nuclear war. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2968.0s)]
*  God damn it scares the fuck out of me. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2971.0s)]
*  And I always wonder if the same sort of decision making apparatus that exists and pushing [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2974.0s)]
*  through OxyContin also exists in pushing through wars, also exists in pushing through [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2981.0s)]
*  just things that like morally we would all say these are terrible, terrible things. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2987.0s)]
*  We should all agree on this. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2995.0s)]
*  And to be able to convince large groups of people to engage in them because you're the [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=2997.0s)]
*  leader. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3001.0s)]
*  I mean, something that that I've been looking at for for a while now is is trying to get [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3002.0s)]
*  into the weapons contracting business, meaning like, you know, what the big ones, the [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3008.0s)]
*  McDonald Douglas, the Raytheons, the Boeing, the companies that are making so much money. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3015.0s)]
*  I was I was in Pearl Harbor working on a film and they had the nuclear submarines coming [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3024.0s)]
*  in and out of the harbor. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3031.0s)]
*  And have you ever seen one? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3033.0s)]
*  These these Trident submarines? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3034.0s)]
*  No. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3036.0s)]
*  And they're they're amazing. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3037.0s)]
*  Like, you know, it never ceases to amaze me that like many of our greatest creative accomplishments [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3039.0s)]
*  are these weapons systems. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3045.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3046.0s)]
*  Like you've been on an aircraft carrier before. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3047.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3049.0s)]
*  Or witness the awe and spectacle of those planes. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3050.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3053.0s)]
*  There's incredible. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3054.0s)]
*  And we were filming on a carrier in Pearl Harbor and and the subs kept coming in and [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3055.0s)]
*  out near these massive sleek. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3060.0s)]
*  They look like sharks and they're cruising slow and they dock. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3063.0s)]
*  I see one, Jamie. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3067.0s)]
*  And and and I we had handlers from Pearl Harbor there and I'm like, you know, could I could [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3068.0s)]
*  I tour one? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3075.0s)]
*  And they were they went to the Admiral the base and we came back. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3076.0s)]
*  Yes, you can tour one. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3079.0s)]
*  So they took me to a to a nuclear submarine that was tied up at Pearl Harbor and they [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3081.0s)]
*  took me on it. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3088.0s)]
*  And I go and I've got these public affairs people and the captain of the sub and show [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3089.0s)]
*  me around the sub and you walk and they're just awesome and they're massive and they're [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3093.0s)]
*  full of people. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3097.0s)]
*  And and it's just all like the most like technical high tech shit you've ever seen in your life. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3098.0s)]
*  And like this is the navigation room. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3104.0s)]
*  This is where we control the sub. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3106.0s)]
*  And they're showing me the equipment. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3107.0s)]
*  I'm like, how much does this equipment cost? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3109.0s)]
*  And they're like, well, we can't we can't really tell you. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3111.0s)]
*  But it's 50, 100, between 50 and 100 million dollars for this area of the sub. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3114.0s)]
*  And then they take me past the nuclear reactors where there's armed guys guarding the nuclear [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3120.0s)]
*  reactors because they're propelled by nukes. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3125.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, how much does it we can't tell you. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3127.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3130.0s)]
*  And then they get you into the torpedo rooms where there's these massive torpedoes, the [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3131.0s)]
*  dozens of them. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3137.0s)]
*  And you're like, how much do these things cost? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3138.0s)]
*  We can't tell you. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3141.0s)]
*  We can't tell you. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3142.0s)]
*  Then they take you to the fucking missile room where there's 10 missiles. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3143.0s)]
*  OK, missiles that have nuclear warheads that can go on. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3149.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3153.0s)]
*  Sir, how much do these cost? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3154.0s)]
*  Well, we can't tell you that. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3157.0s)]
*  Then you start looking up the prices. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3158.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3161.0s)]
*  And you figure for a nuclear missile with the warhead and the guidance system and all [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3162.0s)]
*  the propulsion, you've got to be looking at least 30 million. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3167.0s)]
*  That's my guess. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3171.0s)]
*  For one. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3172.0s)]
*  What do you think a nuclear missile armed and loaded costs? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3173.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3176.0s)]
*  I'm going to say 30 million minimum. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3177.0s)]
*  You're just guessing? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3179.0s)]
*  I'm guessing. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3180.0s)]
*  But I think I'm under guessing. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3181.0s)]
*  Probably. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3183.0s)]
*  And I've done some calculations. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3184.0s)]
*  Oh, there was a question about this recently because the missiles that they shot at the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3185.0s)]
*  Chinese air balloon, that balloon, the spy balloon, they missed one of them. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3189.0s)]
*  And then there was a talk of how much that missed cost. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3194.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3197.0s)]
*  A miss costs a lot of money. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3198.0s)]
*  And so I'm on this sub and I'm looking at what appears to be. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3199.0s)]
*  That was 400K. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3203.0s)]
*  The ones that are out of the plane. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3206.0s)]
*  Maybe it's different. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3207.0s)]
*  But that wasn't a nuke. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3208.0s)]
*  That wasn't. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3209.0s)]
*  I'm talking about a nuclear missile. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3210.0s)]
*  F-22 Raptor. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3211.0s)]
*  A nuclear missile fired from a submarine. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3212.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3217.0s)]
*  So here's. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3218.0s)]
*  So now I'm on this thing. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3219.0s)]
*  I'm counting these missiles. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3220.0s)]
*  10 missiles. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3221.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3222.0s)]
*  That I can see. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3223.0s)]
*  So I'm trying to do the math. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3224.0s)]
*  I'd say it's 500 million dollars worth of missiles on one sub. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3227.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3232.0s)]
*  I'm looking. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3233.0s)]
*  I can see eight subs docked in Pearl Harbor. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3234.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3237.0s)]
*  So now I'm like there's 10 times eight. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3238.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3241.0s)]
*  There's 80 missiles in my visual at 500 a missile. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3242.0s)]
*  And these are just the subs I can see. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3245.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3247.0s)]
*  So I'm thinking, well, wait a minute. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3248.0s)]
*  If one of these subs fires one missile. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3249.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3253.0s)]
*  We're fucked. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3254.0s)]
*  We're done. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3255.0s)]
*  The world is probably over. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3256.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3258.0s)]
*  One missile goes. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3259.0s)]
*  We've got at least 80 of them that I can see. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3260.0s)]
*  How many people are making money off of this game. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3263.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3266.0s)]
*  Where's the money going that we have to keep putting loading these submarines with nuclear [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3267.0s)]
*  missiles. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3273.0s)]
*  One of which is going to get it done. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3274.0s)]
*  That's not then including all the missiles that are in the silos. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3276.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3279.0s)]
*  All the missiles that are flying 24 7 in planes and bombs like we are loaded up. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3280.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3287.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3288.0s)]
*  We got enough. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3289.0s)]
*  Yet we keep making more. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3290.0s)]
*  And this is you know like Purdue Pharma these these companies and now it's all turning into [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3291.0s)]
*  like a control drones right that are going to be like the new forefront of the weapon [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3299.0s)]
*  systems where all the money is going to go. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3303.0s)]
*  But I was thinking like what would happen if you took two of these subs and took them [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3305.0s)]
*  offline and built I don't know schools. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3311.0s)]
*  What would happen with the would. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3314.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3317.0s)]
*  Would we would we threat what would our national security be threatened. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3318.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3321.0s)]
*  Would it would our country be better off. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3322.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3325.0s)]
*  With all the money all the money is going into the military and that's I'm support the military. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3326.0s)]
*  You know I've done multiple films about our troops and I understand I've been to Iraq [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3333.0s)]
*  with the seal platoon. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3340.0s)]
*  I know what you know I've had a front row seat to the reality of what these men and [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3341.0s)]
*  women are going through this kind of spending. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3346.0s)]
*  It seems to me to be a bit reckless. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3350.0s)]
*  Well at the very least they're incentivized. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3356.0s)]
*  They're incentivized to to be in conflict. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3360.0s)]
*  If there's that much money to be made for sure the same way Purdue Pharma was incentivized [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3364.0s)]
*  to pretend that it wasn't addictive even though they knew it was the same kind of thing. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3371.0s)]
*  Like there's decisions that get made specifically because of money. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3376.0s)]
*  That's really scary for us because we want to think that if we have a leader we trust someone to be a [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3381.0s)]
*  leader. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3386.0s)]
*  We have this thought in our head that this is our chief right. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3387.0s)]
*  This is the best warrior. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3390.0s)]
*  This is the wisest person that's lived the longest and the best to govern us. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3391.0s)]
*  We would never want to believe that someone that he appoints and that's in that chain involved in [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3395.0s)]
*  running all these people is making decisions that will absolutely cost lives and souls. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3402.0s)]
*  People will be destroyed but they're making these decisions because of money because of money. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3409.0s)]
*  And it's like the same thing with with some of these drugs is the same thing with some of the big [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3414.0s)]
*  weapons systems. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3420.0s)]
*  You know some of like if you're if you're the if you're the president right if you're the next president [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3421.0s)]
*  of the U.S. and you decide that you want to reduce spending in the military. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3427.0s)]
*  So say there's a jet program F-35 or some massive jet program that's costing a shitload of money and [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3433.0s)]
*  you want to try and slow it down. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3442.0s)]
*  Well what they do is they build different parts of the aircraft in different states. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3444.0s)]
*  So there might be 30 states that are all contributing to making one weapon system. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3449.0s)]
*  So if you try and dismantle it you've got the government the representatives from 30 different states saying you [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3455.0s)]
*  can't do it. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3461.0s)]
*  We've got a factory that's making the guidance system. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3462.0s)]
*  We've got a factory that's arming the ordinance on the missiles. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3464.0s)]
*  We're doing the landing gear and the weapons are now part of the economy and they can't be divorced from it. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3469.0s)]
*  And the spending just goes on. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3476.0s)]
*  Isn't there an argument on the other side though that we can't allow another country to achieve military [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3478.0s)]
*  superiority over us. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3484.0s)]
*  And if we stop innovation and stop the flow of money into developing these new jets that we would run the [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3485.0s)]
*  risk of that happening. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3492.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3493.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3494.0s)]
*  And that's what's going on with China right now. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3495.0s)]
*  That we're in an arms race with China. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3498.0s)]
*  A lot of AI technology involved. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3501.0s)]
*  We're like we're now starting to discuss letting AI fly and arm and release weapons on targets that are [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3504.0s)]
*  AI assessed and AI authorized kills because China is doing the same thing. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3516.0s)]
*  And we don't want we don't want to be out teched by China. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3522.0s)]
*  And so we're in a never ending arms race to have the best technology. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3525.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3530.0s)]
*  OK fine. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3531.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3532.0s)]
*  It's just a lot of money. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3533.0s)]
*  You know and I can't help but think like who's making money. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3535.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3541.0s)]
*  It says CBO estimates that estimates that plans for U.S. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3542.0s)]
*  nuclear forces as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget and supporting documents would cost [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3545.0s)]
*  seven hundred and oh my God seven hundred fifty six billion over the 2023 2032 period. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3550.0s)]
*  OK nine years. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3558.0s)]
*  One hundred and twenty two billion more than CBO's 2021 estimate for the 2021 to 2030 period. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3559.0s)]
*  Sorry guys we underestimated by one hundred and twenty two billion. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3568.0s)]
*  This is our B61 nuke. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3571.0s)]
*  That's they put on a lot of planes and stuff. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3574.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3576.0s)]
*  Do you have a price tag on that one? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3577.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3578.0s)]
*  It's roughly twenty eight million. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3579.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3583.0s)]
*  You're dead on. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3584.0s)]
*  So this is what I'm saying. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3585.0s)]
*  We have three thousand of them. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3586.0s)]
*  Jamie can you how many do we have? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3587.0s)]
*  Somewhere in the range of three to four thousand. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3588.0s)]
*  So what's the total number just on that missile? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3589.0s)]
*  Can you do that multiplication? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3591.0s)]
*  30 times three thousand. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3593.0s)]
*  Could you imagine the horror of how many missiles do we have? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3595.0s)]
*  How many of those? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3599.0s)]
*  There's something in the range of I found some that's to be at thirty seven hundred [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3600.0s)]
*  Nukes. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3604.0s)]
*  That's rounded off to three thousand five hundred. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3605.0s)]
*  Imagine three thousand five hundred nuclear missiles launching through the air. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3607.0s)]
*  The horrors of that. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3613.0s)]
*  One of those is the eighty three Hiroshima bombs. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3615.0s)]
*  Just two. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3617.0s)]
*  Just one of them. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3619.0s)]
*  It's over. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3620.0s)]
*  Game over. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3621.0s)]
*  One. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3622.0s)]
*  Eighty three Hiroshima bombs. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3623.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3625.0s)]
*  That's like this is the issue. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3626.0s)]
*  Like. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3628.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3629.0s)]
*  Even that one blew up in the sky and these can go underground and make things worse. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3630.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3634.0s)]
*  But those are just air delivered. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3635.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3636.0s)]
*  Can you show me that sub? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3637.0s)]
*  That nuclear sub? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3638.0s)]
*  I mean there's a few. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3639.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly when he saw. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3640.0s)]
*  I was trying to find a good picture from Pearl Harbor of a bunch of subs. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3641.0s)]
*  It is pretty fucking amazing. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3645.0s)]
*  They're amazing. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3647.0s)]
*  They have a sub that runs on a nuclear reactor. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3648.0s)]
*  They're beautiful achievements of engineering and you know skill and talent and like to be [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3649.0s)]
*  on that thing was awe inspiring. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3655.0s)]
*  But my god are they expensive. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3658.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3660.0s)]
*  Like really expensive. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3661.0s)]
*  Yeah it makes sense. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3662.0s)]
*  I mean can't get one that does something like that for cheap. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3663.0s)]
*  But it's just it is kind of amazing that our biggest accomplishments are in the world of [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3668.0s)]
*  weaponry. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3672.0s)]
*  In the world of weaponry. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3673.0s)]
*  And like. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3674.0s)]
*  Other than communication like cell phones and the like and wireless internet. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3675.0s)]
*  This is crazy that they develop a nuclear powered underwater weapon that is designed [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3682.0s)]
*  to deliver. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3691.0s)]
*  Taken out of country. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3692.0s)]
*  Yeah designed really only to deliver nuclear missiles. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3693.0s)]
*  I mean how many does this motherfucker carry on it? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3696.0s)]
*  How many cities can this thing take out instantly? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3701.0s)]
*  And how many do we have? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3703.0s)]
*  Like I've seen like I said I saw six of them in Pearl Harbor. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3705.0s)]
*  Imagine those kids. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3709.0s)]
*  These kids look like they're like 20 years old. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3710.0s)]
*  Look how young they look. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  That kid looks like they could be my friend's son. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3713.0s)]
*  And they're bottom right with the glasses. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3715.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3717.0s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3718.0s)]
*  Wild. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3719.0s)]
*  To be that young you're holding a machine gun on a nuclear powered tank. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3720.0s)]
*  Or you're that dude. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3725.0s)]
*  You're the captain. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3726.0s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3727.0s)]
*  You're the vice admiral Bill Houston. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3728.0s)]
*  You run that shit. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3730.0s)]
*  You run that. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3732.0s)]
*  Like we talk about power like what we think of power and you know. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3733.0s)]
*  That's a crazy job that guy has. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3738.0s)]
*  Dana White has a tough job. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3740.0s)]
*  That's a job. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3742.0s)]
*  That's a job. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3743.0s)]
*  This has to be so nerve wracking for all these people on board. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3744.0s)]
*  Especially when it goes in the water. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3748.0s)]
*  When you know you're underwater like Jesus Christ. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3750.0s)]
*  I know they work. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3752.0s)]
*  I mean but do you remember there was a Russian one that went down. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3753.0s)]
*  There was a nuclear sub that went down. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3757.0s)]
*  And that's where the term can neither confirm nor deny. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3759.0s)]
*  That's when it was because they had the answer. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3763.0s)]
*  So they had to have an answer. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3765.0s)]
*  It was like is this going on. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3766.0s)]
*  You guys retrieving a nuclear sub from Russia. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3767.0s)]
*  What's going on. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3769.0s)]
*  So because they had an answer I don't think they have to answer it now. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3770.0s)]
*  But they had to come up with a phrase. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3773.0s)]
*  Can neither confirm nor deny. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3775.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3776.0s)]
*  What was that about. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3777.0s)]
*  Which sub was that. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3778.0s)]
*  I think they allegedly recovered it which is crazy. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3780.0s)]
*  So we have the ability to recover a nuclear sub at the bottom of the ocean. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3784.0s)]
*  What the hell man. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3789.0s)]
*  I mean that's the more time I've spent with the military. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3792.0s)]
*  Like when I went. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3797.0s)]
*  When I was writing Lone Survivor I got to go to Iraq with the SEAL team. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3801.0s)]
*  And see them operating. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3805.0s)]
*  And see the skill with which they operated. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3808.0s)]
*  You know and that's almost. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3811.0s)]
*  There's no technology involved there. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3813.0s)]
*  Like SEALs don't really need this kind of stuff. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3816.0s)]
*  That's just more like give me a Jeep. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3819.0s)]
*  Give me some night vision goggles. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3821.0s)]
*  Give me some good intel on where the guy is and I'll deal with it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3823.0s)]
*  That was that was beautiful. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3827.0s)]
*  That was like the most elite team training and discipline and structure I'd ever seen. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3830.0s)]
*  So on a human level what I observed with the group like the SEALs was such an incredibly advanced form of team behavior. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3835.0s)]
*  Then when you get into this stuff. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3846.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen an Apache helicopter up close? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3848.0s)]
*  So these pilots for Apache helicopters we use some in Lone. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3852.0s)]
*  They're wearing these helicopters pull up and they're just incredible looking pieces of equipment. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3856.0s)]
*  And these 22 year old kids are flying them. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3862.0s)]
*  And they've got a helmet with a mask and they call it slaving the ship to the goggles. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3865.0s)]
*  So they they they activate the goggles so that wherever they turn the helicopter turns and whether they've got eye sensors. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3871.0s)]
*  So where their eyes go the guns go. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3879.0s)]
*  So you look at it you kill it. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3883.0s)]
*  And worth they're giving us these demonstrations and they're flying them all around the set. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3885.0s)]
*  I'm like OK I've seen the pyramids. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3889.0s)]
*  I've seen the Notre Dame Cathedral in France. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3893.0s)]
*  I've I've seen a lot of Van Gogh's. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3896.0s)]
*  I saw the Mona Lisa. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3898.0s)]
*  That was great. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3900.0s)]
*  Seeing this fucking helicopter turning as the guy's head turns with the weapon systems. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3901.0s)]
*  I'm like who's building cooler shit than this. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3906.0s)]
*  Yes it wins. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3913.0s)]
*  It wins. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3915.0s)]
*  It is our greatest achievement. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3916.0s)]
*  All right. These weapons of death. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3918.0s)]
*  They're incredible. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3920.0s)]
*  I just like. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3921.0s)]
*  Well that's what you can make if you have an unlimited budget. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3922.0s)]
*  And really smart guys. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3925.0s)]
*  Yeah. Really smart. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3927.0s)]
*  And Oppenheimer had a hell of a like that was a great build. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3928.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3932.0s)]
*  That was a great build. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3933.0s)]
*  But man it's expensive and it's kind of a bummer when this shit gets used. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3934.0s)]
*  It's really bad. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3940.0s)]
*  What do you think about all this UAP UFO stuff. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3942.0s)]
*  Have you thought about this. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3947.0s)]
*  Do you think that this is some sort of a government program like they've developed these high speed drones in secrecy. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3948.0s)]
*  I mean because that's why prevailing theory. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3956.0s)]
*  I have trouble understanding it. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3959.0s)]
*  Like take the UFO aspect of it right. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3961.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3964.0s)]
*  Like yes there's absolutely zero question on earth that there's life out in the solar system. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3965.0s)]
*  It's an infinite solar system. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3971.0s)]
*  It goes on forever. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3973.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3974.0s)]
*  Infinite universe. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3975.0s)]
*  Smoke some 5m EO and you'll go out there. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3978.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3980.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3981.0s)]
*  And like yes it's out there. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3982.0s)]
*  The government keeping it secret and being that capable to find it and keep it secret. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3987.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3992.0s)]
*  I took my shrooms with my friend Mike Torgorio and we tried to get on area 51 one day and we drove up there. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=3994.0s)]
*  That's such an I just did mushrooms thing to do. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4002.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4004.0s)]
*  We tried and we like you've ever gone up there. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4005.0s)]
*  No I have not. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4007.0s)]
*  It's this road area 51. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4008.0s)]
*  It's this highway in the bases over a mountain. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4009.0s)]
*  But the road goes on forever and you're driving and we're high as fuck on mushrooms and we're not getting any closer to the mountain. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4012.0s)]
*  And we're driving and we're driving and we're driving. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4020.0s)]
*  And suddenly there's a white van behind us. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4023.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4026.0s)]
*  With the light on and we're like oh fuck. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4027.0s)]
*  OK. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4029.0s)]
*  Like this is kind of what we thought might happen. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4030.0s)]
*  And sure enough guys get out military dudes with guns and they're looking at us like OK. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4031.0s)]
*  You guys are mushrooms right. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4037.0s)]
*  We've seen this. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4039.0s)]
*  We've seen this. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4040.0s)]
*  Turn around. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4041.0s)]
*  It's so common. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4042.0s)]
*  Turn around. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4043.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4044.0s)]
*  It's almost like the mushrooms want you to go to area 51. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4045.0s)]
*  You're not getting on the base. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4048.0s)]
*  They're like there's a hotel called the Little Alien. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4049.0s)]
*  Go down there with everybody else that's on mushrooms and you could sit out there all night and have all your theories. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4052.0s)]
*  And you're turning around. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4058.0s)]
*  And we're like. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4059.0s)]
*  Roger that. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4060.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4062.0s)]
*  So funny that they called it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4063.0s)]
*  Yeah they knew it. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4066.0s)]
*  Like they just get. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4067.0s)]
*  It must be so common. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4068.0s)]
*  Buddies are like let's take some shrooms and get on area 51. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4069.0s)]
*  And these guys are not they weren't nasty or tough but they're like yeah you're going to turn around drink some water. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4072.0s)]
*  Turn around and go to the Little Alien Hotel. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4078.0s)]
*  You're allowed to get like a certain distance and then it's illegal. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4081.0s)]
*  And I believe they had to expand that distance. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4084.0s)]
*  I want to say it was during the Obama administration. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4087.0s)]
*  They had to acknowledge the. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4090.0s)]
*  It might have been before that. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4092.0s)]
*  They had. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4093.0s)]
*  It might have been Clinton. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4094.0s)]
*  They had to acknowledge the existence or might have been Bush rather. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4095.0s)]
*  They had to acknowledge the existence of area 51 in order to expand the forbidden zone. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4098.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4104.0s)]
*  Because they had a forbidden zone but they did not know no flyover no drive. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4105.0s)]
*  You can't hike in because people were filming things. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4109.0s)]
*  John Lear in particular a lot of people were filming things that set up like very strong telescopes and high speed optics and they were filming these tests of these things. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4113.0s)]
*  Whether or not these things for UFOs or whether it's top secret shit they're working on. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4124.0s)]
*  Obviously the stealth bomber came from that program. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4128.0s)]
*  The Harrier jump jet which would like vertically lift and then take off. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4130.0s)]
*  They made a lot of wild shit that is absolutely from us. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4134.0s)]
*  But the alleged claims and the most fascinating one is this guy Bob Lazar who claims to have worked at S4 which is a site for of Area 51. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4138.0s)]
*  And he was on a program designed to back engineer this recovered disk. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4149.0s)]
*  It's a fascinating story because if he's full of shit. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4155.0s)]
*  Oh my God what a great story. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4158.0s)]
*  This guy's pulled the wool over people's eyes for 30 years. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4159.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4162.0s)]
*  Because he told the story like 1989 was the first time he told it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4163.0s)]
*  So it's more than 30 years. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4166.0s)]
*  But he's also he has like real knowledge of the the area. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4167.0s)]
*  He has real knowledge of Los Alamos labs where they tried to say that he never worked there. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4174.0s)]
*  But then they found him on the employee roster from the time he went in there. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4178.0s)]
*  People knew him. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4182.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4183.0s)]
*  Like it seems like the guy really was a propulsion specialist and they really did try to get some off the fucking beaten path scientists like let's take it because they have to get fresh eyes in these things. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4184.0s)]
*  Allegedly every few years they bring in but everyone's sworn to secrecy and it's very compartmentalized. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4195.0s)]
*  So the metallurgy guys are not allowed to talk to the propulsion guys the propulsion. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4201.0s)]
*  No one gets together and goes what the fuck is this. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4205.0s)]
*  They can't have a group of scientists. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4207.0s)]
*  So they exist in a team form and it just it doesn't work that way. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4209.0s)]
*  They need more people. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4213.0s)]
*  And he said no one was able to figure out anything about it other than there's some sort of a reactor that worked on some new element. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4214.0s)]
*  It was theoretical back then but now they know it's a real element. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4221.0s)]
*  I will believe it. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4224.0s)]
*  Like I have no reason to not believe it and to certainly not. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4225.0s)]
*  Like what I was getting at though is that like when you see an insane system like these helicopters and the goggles and then you see these insane nuclear powered submarines and these insane aircraft carriers like what we have built is so fucking mind blowing. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4230.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't we think that we've hit some next level propulsion system and that the reason why the Pentagon is talking about out of this world crafts they're obscuring reality. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4246.0s)]
*  Like the reason why people are like coming forward and telling you about their experience in this program like maybe that's obscuring reality. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4258.0s)]
*  It might be bullshit. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4265.0s)]
*  It might be that we the government and the military and the contractors don't want any of our enemies to know that they have some fucking bonkers shit that can go literally like the speed of light that we have that we have. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4266.0s)]
*  So I was just working up in New Mexico and like we were filming around Los Alamos. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4280.0s)]
*  Have you ever been to Los Alamos? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4289.0s)]
*  No. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4291.0s)]
*  I mean like it's it's amazing that like people just haven't seen the laboratory the current Los Alamos research laboratory which is you know across the street from where Oppenheimer lived when he was doing the Manhattan Project which was this boy school that they kicked everyone out and all the scientists moved in which was not in the film which is quite interesting. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4292.0s)]
*  Los Alamos if you can ever go there and see the museums and you know it's just a fascinating place to see where they built that bomb. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4315.0s)]
*  But across the street or actually across this river from where Oppenheimer lived is now the current Los Alamos research laboratory. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4323.0s)]
*  Pull up a picture of that one if you want to see something mind blowing. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4332.0s)]
*  It's bigger than UCLA campus. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4335.0s)]
*  It's this massive research facility. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4339.0s)]
*  In Los Alamos which and you can't see half of it. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4344.0s)]
*  It's supposedly a giant chunk of it is underground. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4349.0s)]
*  It's completely armed. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4353.0s)]
*  We would drive. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4355.0s)]
*  There's a road that road at the top. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4356.0s)]
*  There is this access road that we would drive every day to go up. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4358.0s)]
*  There's a ski mountain above it. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4362.0s)]
*  So for some reason they let you drive fairly close but it's all Homeland Security protecting it super fortified and armed. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4363.0s)]
*  And it's in the middle of fucking nowhere. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4372.0s)]
*  And this was birthed from you can see where it is right. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4374.0s)]
*  It's in the middle of nowhere literally in the middle of nowhere. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4378.0s)]
*  We first got up there and we're like what are they doing here. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4382.0s)]
*  And like everyone's like well it's digital warfare. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4386.0s)]
*  It's made nuclear maintenance. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4391.0s)]
*  It's you know alien dissection. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4395.0s)]
*  It is like like like forget area 51. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4398.0s)]
*  This place was like you know so if we're inventing shit this is the kind of place we're inventing it. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4402.0s)]
*  And we went out a couple of days to these. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4409.0s)]
*  There's some restaurants and bars in the town of Los Alamos. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4411.0s)]
*  And I'm like if I'm China I'm just hiring. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4415.0s)]
*  I'm hiring hot girls getting them to turn and putting them as bartenders or cocktail waitresses because all the scientists from Los Alamos. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4418.0s)]
*  Just go there after work and get drunk. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4427.0s)]
*  That's where that's where everything's going down. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4429.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4432.0s)]
*  You've got it like half of its underground. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4433.0s)]
*  Well that's what they say. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4435.0s)]
*  Like we'd be up on this mountain. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4436.0s)]
*  There's a this place that's what it looks like. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4439.0s)]
*  It's massive. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4442.0s)]
*  It's in the middle of nowhere. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4444.0s)]
*  So I'm like I try and start conversation. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4446.0s)]
*  But guys what do you know about Los Alamos. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4449.0s)]
*  Jamie what's that image to the left. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4451.0s)]
*  It's got all the I looked it up. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4453.0s)]
*  What is that. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4454.0s)]
*  What they've got like they've got like the accelerators you know like particle accelerators. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4456.0s)]
*  I mean I'm sure half your listeners know what this is. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4464.0s)]
*  But like this is all was all started by Oppenheimer. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4465.0s)]
*  Every the whole. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4469.0s)]
*  I used to be a log cabin. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4471.0s)]
*  No that's the school. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4473.0s)]
*  I think that's the school that they took over. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4474.0s)]
*  They show a little bit of it. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4476.0s)]
*  Oh for all the scientists. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4477.0s)]
*  Yeah it was such a crazy story like how they did these scientists just moved into this this school kicked all the kids out under national security order and the scientists moved in and they just like to your point no one knew what anyone else was doing when they were building the bomb. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4479.0s)]
*  So you're working on one part. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4497.0s)]
*  I'm working on another. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4499.0s)]
*  Our wives have no idea what's going on. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4500.0s)]
*  We're going out and building the bomb all day and coming home and just like drinking they all drink and like I think there was like a lot of white swapping and weird shit going on. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4504.0s)]
*  They were just partying and building fucking nuclear bombs. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4514.0s)]
*  And now you go out there and see what this and it's just like I just want to know what are we doing. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4518.0s)]
*  How much does it cost and who is in charge. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4525.0s)]
*  And Los Alamos now. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4528.0s)]
*  So if there is those systems in my mind if there was an alien ship found the government wanted they're going to take it to Los Alamos. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4530.0s)]
*  That's where they're going to take it. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4538.0s)]
*  That's where they're going to dissect it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4540.0s)]
*  And whatever is going on out there is some deep and real shit. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4542.0s)]
*  That's where Lazar worked. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4548.0s)]
*  If you go from Orville Wilbur and Orville Wright's invention of the aircraft how long is the time period before someone drops a nuclear bomb out of one. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4551.0s)]
*  How much time is between was it 60 years. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4562.0s)]
*  Like what was when was Wilbur and Orville's first flight question. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4566.0s)]
*  Because if you think of that just think of like what an insane jump in technology from the very first airplane to dropping a nuclear bomb out of one. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4570.0s)]
*  Or just dropping a bomb right. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4582.0s)]
*  Weaponizing yes air flight weaponizing air flight and like but a nuclear bomb. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4584.0s)]
*  Even more insane because the technology involved just what I think 1902 around when they credit them for flying. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4591.0s)]
*  That was Kitty Hawk. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4598.0s)]
*  Trying to find the exact date. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4600.0s)]
*  I did too. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4602.0s)]
*  That seems late 1902. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4603.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4605.0s)]
*  So that's 45 years. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4606.0s)]
*  Is that real. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4609.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4610.0s)]
*  40. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4611.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4612.0s)]
*  And so you five years before they dropped a nuclear bomb out of it. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4613.0s)]
*  That's what it is right. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4615.0s)]
*  It's 47 MC like 1903 is the plane. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4616.0s)]
*  So it's when I think they got the was Kitty Hawk. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4619.0s)]
*  Kitty Hawk was in 1903 was it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4622.0s)]
*  The flight. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4624.0s)]
*  The flight. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4625.0s)]
*  I don't think it was. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4626.0s)]
*  I'll double check. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4627.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4628.0s)]
*  December 1903. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4629.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4631.0s)]
*  Well that makes sense though because there's video of it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4632.0s)]
*  There's film of it. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4635.0s)]
*  So it has to be when when did they invent film. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4636.0s)]
*  You could. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4639.0s)]
*  There's some stuff from the 1800s but it's rough. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4640.0s)]
*  That was bad film. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4643.0s)]
*  It was like jumpy like. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4644.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4645.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4646.0s)]
*  But so your point is like how short a period of time. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4647.0s)]
*  What an insane job. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4649.0s)]
*  And so where is it going. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4650.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4652.0s)]
*  And what do they have already. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4653.0s)]
*  Like if they have programs to do something like Los Alamos Labs if they have programs [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4654.0s)]
*  to do something like area as for if they can develop these insane machines in silence what [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4659.5s)]
*  it what it what if what else do they. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4668.0s)]
*  I controlled aircraft that's going to fly there's a great article in the New York Times [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4670.0s)]
*  yesterday about it. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4674.4s)]
*  All these companies that are now scrambling to take over the buildings which which is [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4676.0s)]
*  a threat to the established weapons manufacturers jet builders because they're the future are [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4680.48s)]
*  fighting China in a large like full scale battle is going to be a controlled drone dependent. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4687.08s)]
*  So rather than sending human beings in 60 million dollar jets they're going to send [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4697.5199999999995s)]
*  swarms of two or three million dollar a controlled fighter drones. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4702.839999999999s)]
*  And those are going to be self driven right. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4708.7s)]
*  Self flown the way Elon's trying to get self driving vehicles and be self. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4712.82s)]
*  This is the plan. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4717.98s)]
*  Great article yesterday. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4719.16s)]
*  And that's that's where it's going. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4720.98s)]
*  And if Orville Wright could see that robot wars robot 100 percent robot wars robot wars [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4723.62s)]
*  like like Cameron had it right. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4730.0599999999995s)]
*  You know Terminator had it right. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4733.58s)]
*  And like like a I do right. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4735.82s)]
*  It's on. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4741.259999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4742.259999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4743.259999999999s)]
*  I mean I think this is what not I'm not defending Ted Kaczynski but this is what Ted Kaczynski's [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4744.259999999999s)]
*  manifesto was about was the construction of technology was going to replace the human [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4749.42s)]
*  race. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4754.62s)]

*  Look at this fucking. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4764.98s)]
*  And like my business is on strike you know the writers and I support my strike but you [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4766.66s)]
*  know A.I. is a big issue. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4773.5s)]
*  We don't like I was worried about A.I. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4774.82s)]
*  Well everybody's worried about A.I. right. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4776.74s)]
*  Like A.I. is going to be fighting our wars and like you know when A.I. is going to be [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4780.0199999999995s)]
*  writing books. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4785.7s)]
*  When Trump was talking about Space Force back in the day like this is Space Force. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4787.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4793.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4795.66s)]
*  And it's funny they didn't even think of that in Star Wars. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4796.66s)]
*  A.I. no no they didn't. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4799.66s)]
*  Isn't that wild. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4801.9400000000005s)]
*  Like in Star Wars no one had a cell phone and they had light sabers. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4802.9400000000005s)]
*  They did have light sabers. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4806.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean come on. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4807.9400000000005s)]

*  R2 helped with some shit but I don't know what he was really doing. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4811.9400000000005s)]

*  But imagine. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4814.9400000000005s)]
*  But there's a giant difference between that and sending a pilotless jet to engage in [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4815.9400000000005s)]
*  combat. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4823.18s)]

*  We filmed something at MIT and they took me into the robotics department like down in [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4837.820000000001s)]

*  and they took us down to the robotics wing and showed us a robot cheetah that they had [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4866.0199999999995s)]
*  invented that was sprinting up and down the halls and jumping over little obstacles and [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=4871.54s)]

*  And if you look at Oxycontin and what the Sacklers were able to do and how they were [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5111.099999999999s)]
*  able to basically take something much more lethal and certainly more profitable than [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5115.7s)]
*  fucking crack and get away with it. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5120.9s)]
*  Like that's that's something that we we talk about quite a bit. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5124.58s)]
*  It's pretty insane. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5128.38s)]

*  this to happen and that influence allowed this to happen. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5136.5s)]
*  Most people just trusted their health care professional nature and then in like as it [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5140.219999999999s)]
*  said in the film or in your show you know that guy's trusting the FDA. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5145.7s)]
*  He's trusting them that they know what they're doing. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5151.5s)]
*  What do you think you would do if you know you hurt yourself you were training and you [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5153.98s)]
*  know had had a really painful injury say you know you really fucked up your shoulder and [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5159.54s)]
*  in between the immediate pain was you know very high and a doctor was like OK here's [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5166.62s)]
*  a deal like this is going to really fucking hurt. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5174.78s)]
*  What we recommend a low dose of an opioid. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5178.18s)]
*  How would you how would you react to that. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5181.34s)]
*  Well I've had that happen. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5184.34s)]
*  I I have had knee surgery and when I was on in the hospital they had like a morphine drip [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5187.66s)]
*  and it was wonderful. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5194.46s)]
*  It's a very like apparently you press the button and you get more morphine. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5195.7s)]
*  Sure that I think that's how it worked. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5198.9s)]
*  This is a ninety two or somewhere around that 93. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5201.099999999999s)]
*  But when I got my nose fixed I got my nose fixed a few years back and it didn't even [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5208.74s)]
*  hurt and the doctor prescribed medicine or she could bring it back to the first surgery [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5215.62s)]
*  when I when I got the drip when I got the drip he did give me Vicodin. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5219.66s)]
*  It was either Vicodin or Percocet. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5223.0599999999995s)]
*  I can't remember which one was I'm pretty sure it was Vicodin though. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5224.98s)]
*  I only took it once and I felt so stupid. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5227.7s)]
*  It made me feel so dumb and just dull that it wasn't a wonderful feel. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5230.46s)]
*  It wasn't Oxycontin. It wasn't a wonderful feeling at all. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5236.46s)]
*  It sucked. And so I only took it once and I just dealt with the pain. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5239.099999999999s)]
*  And that was a pretty significant knee surgery because it's a patellar tendon grafts. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5243.259999999999s)]
*  I take a piece out of your shin bone piece out of your patellar tendon a piece out of [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5246.7s)]
*  your kneecap and they open you up like a fish and screw into your bones. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5250.7s)]
*  But I didn't take anything else. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5254.94s)]
*  I was like I'm not taking shit. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5256.379999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to deal with pain. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5257.66s)]
*  And then when I got my nose fixed the doctor fixed it and he prescribed me two [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5258.98s)]
*  different opiates. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5264.9s)]
*  One of them was Oxycontin and I forget what the other one was. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5266.58s)]
*  And how long ago was this 15 years ago. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5269.419999999999s)]
*  And when he prescribed it to me I'm like but it doesn't hurt. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5273.0599999999995s)]
*  Mike it doesn't hurt. Like right now it doesn't hurt. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5278.099999999999s)]
*  You did the operation. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5280.179999999999s)]
*  It's done right. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5281.259999999999s)]
*  Like it's not hurting. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5282.74s)]
*  I mean it's uncomfortable because I've got these fucking sponge things shoved up my [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5284.34s)]
*  nostrils with little tubes in them to expand my nostrils and allow it all to heal in the [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5289.26s)]
*  right form. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5293.62s)]
*  After it was horrible it sucked. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5294.74s)]
*  But it's a really good move. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5296.62s)]
*  You have a deviated septum. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5297.66s)]
*  My nose I broke my nose for the first time when I was like five and I think I broke it [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5299.3s)]
*  who knows how many times after that maybe a dozen. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5303.3s)]
*  It was destroyed. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5306.86s)]

*  It was completely closed off. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5309.86s)]
*  So they fixed it. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5311.74s)]
*  The doctor was fantastic. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5312.82s)]
*  He fixed it. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5314.34s)]
*  But he tried to give me two different opiates. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5315.54s)]
*  He's like you're going to need these. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5317.34s)]
*  And I was like but it doesn't hurt. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5318.78s)]
*  Like I don't understand what you're saying. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5320.7s)]
*  I'm telling you right now I'm not in pain. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5322.18s)]
*  Am I going to be in more pain. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5323.78s)]
*  Like how am I going to be in more pain later. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5325.0199999999995s)]
*  I think like right after the operations the most pain be maxing out. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5326.46s)]
*  And he goes you're going to you're going to be very very uncomfortable. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5329.66s)]
*  Just take this prescription. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5332.58s)]
*  And I took it home and just put this prescription in the drawer. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5333.78s)]
*  I go OK if it gets crazy if something happens and I just I can't sleep and I'm in agony. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5337.0599999999995s)]
*  It never hurt at all. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5342.259999999999s)]
*  It was just uncomfortable. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5343.86s)]
*  Just a little you know like I got punched in the nose. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5345.0599999999995s)]
*  But it wasn't like I can't sleep. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5347.98s)]
*  I was like this isn't fine. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5350.259999999999s)]
*  Like what the fuck are you trying to give me heroin for this. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5351.419999999999s)]
*  Yes you are. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5354.299999999999s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5354.86s)]
*  He did give you heroin. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5355.62s)]
*  Two different kinds. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5356.419999999999s)]
*  I forget what it was but one of them was Oxycontin one of them was something else. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5357.5s)]
*  But I'm like you're giving me two different kinds of painkillers. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5360.7s)]
*  This is when I was kind of already aware of that because I already had people in my family that had had issues with pills. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5363.219999999999s)]
*  I was like dude what are you giving me. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5370.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah it's it's really disturbing. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5373.02s)]
*  My my son broke his collarbone playing lacrosse and I had to take him to the hospital in Connecticut. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5375.820000000001s)]
*  And you know the doctor is like OK you broke collarbone. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5383.700000000001s)]
*  There's not much we can do. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5387.1s)]
*  When you know he was 16 or 17 and he wrote him a script for Oxycontin. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5388.54s)]
*  And I'm like are you out of your fucking mind. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5395.34s)]
*  And I'm like like how the the the prescription. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5398.780000000001s)]
*  Are you out of your mind. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5403.3s)]
*  And the doctor said it works. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5404.9400000000005s)]
*  It works. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5407.06s)]
*  There's going to be pain. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5407.580000000001s)]
*  And I don't know it's interesting because I do wonder you know I remember you know who Marcus's brother Morgan the trail. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5409.1s)]
*  Have you ever met him. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5420.46s)]
*  No I haven't. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5421.42s)]
*  Tough dude. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5421.9800000000005s)]
*  And when I when I was getting ready to do the film I had heard about Morgan but I never met him and I and he had fallen out of a helicopter doing training and broken his back and was was in recouping in Virginia. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5423.14s)]
*  And I knew he'd been hurt. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5437.86s)]
*  And so I wanted to meet him because they're very close and I knew if I was going to make a film about Marcus I had to at least meet Morgan because Morgan's powerful figure Marcus's life. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5439.94s)]
*  So I flew out there and went to his house. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5449.94s)]
*  I got there late at night and a bunch of seals in the house and Morgan was sitting in a chair and they were they were watching TV and he was just sitting there and he was everyone saw he would tremble and he hadn't he decided he wasn't going to take anything and a broken back. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5452.22s)]
*  I'm like dude you're not taking anything. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5469.94s)]
*  And he's like fuck no I'm not taking anything. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5472.74s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to experience this pain. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5475.34s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to process this pain. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5478.299999999999s)]
*  I'm going to use this pain. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5480.78s)]
*  And he wrote out his broken back without any pain and without any pain medication. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5482.5s)]
*  And it did make me think and I still think you know how pain adverse we all are right. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5487.58s)]
*  Like oh it hurts. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5496.099999999999s)]
*  Make it go away. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5498.299999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5499.5s)]
*  Make it go. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5499.86s)]
*  Give me the quickest path to being pain free. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5500.46s)]
*  Drink this smoke this buy this. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5504.219999999999s)]
*  Fuck this whatever it and that we're so bad at tolerating pain and the expectation is oh OK Joe we just worked on your nose. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5507.66s)]
*  You're going to feel pain. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5517.94s)]
*  Take this. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5519.7s)]
*  You don't want that pain. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5520.339999999999s)]
*  No you don't want that pain. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5521.54s)]
*  You can't handle that pain. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5522.46s)]
*  And we're just so fucking soft when it comes to pain. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5524.099999999999s)]
*  Well it's also I think we've been programmed to think that when you're in pain you need to take medication regardless of the dangers of that stuff. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5527.94s)]
*  I remember this sad story from Kovac where this woman overdosed on Tylenol. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5534.78s)]
*  She died from a sedum edipin poison which is apparently fairly common. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5540.34s)]
*  If you take a lot of Tylenol your liver can't process it. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5544.66s)]
*  You get liver failure. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5547.46s)]
*  And it's just from pain. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5549.06s)]
*  You know just didn't want to feel it. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5551.18s)]
*  I don't want to feel like this. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5552.58s)]
*  Give me something that makes me not feel like this. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5553.58s)]
*  But I mean I have not had back surgery but I've had three knee surgeries and I told you on the one I took the one. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5555.820000000001s)]
*  Vicodin. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5564.3s)]
*  But then after that I didn't take anything. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5565.34s)]
*  So my right knee when I got it done I didn't take shit and I got my left knee scoped. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5567.02s)]
*  I didn't take shit. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5570.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I got the nose fixed. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5572.1s)]
*  Didn't take shit. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5575.1s)]
*  I was like you just deal with pain. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5575.9400000000005s)]
*  But back pain I think is a different animal. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5578.02s)]
*  Back pain is debilitating in a way that I haven't experienced. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5580.820000000001s)]
*  I could walk around on crutches if my knee was fucked up. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5585.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5587.74s)]
*  You know there's a there's a difference. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5588.42s)]
*  And I think you've got to be really cautious. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5590.18s)]
*  I don't want to make anybody feel bad because we're taking medication for back pain because I think back pain is something where it just overwhelms your existence. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5592.82s)]
*  If you have a bad herniated disc it does overwhelm. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5602.46s)]
*  I've had them. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5605.62s)]
*  I had surgery on them. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5606.18s)]
*  And like yeah I did you get done. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5607.0599999999995s)]
*  Did you get it fused. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5609.3s)]
*  I had the discectomy. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5610.5s)]
*  OK so they took a little bit of your disc out. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5612.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5614.14s)]
*  In the future if you're ever going to do something like that again like we were talking about stem cells. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5614.54s)]
*  That's the fix. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5618.78s)]
*  And I avoided that kind of surgery. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5620.14s)]
*  You think stem cells for herniated disc. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5623.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5625.22s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5626.0599999999995s)]
*  Stem cells and traction spinal traction it depends on how bad it's herniated whether it's bulging or whether it's ruptured whether it's ruptured. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5626.54s)]
*  They do have disc replacements that many people have done now. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5634.26s)]
*  There are these titanium articulating discs. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5638.62s)]
*  My friend Eddie got it in his back. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5641.98s)]
*  Al Jermain Sterling who is the UFC Bantamweight champion he got it in his neck. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5643.34s)]
*  Or this steel. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5647.26s)]
*  Yeah it's a titanium articulating disc. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5648.139999999999s)]
*  And was he able to fight. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5650.86s)]
*  He fought again and he defended the title. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5652.099999999999s)]
*  He defended the title one to I think three times after that. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5654.0199999999995s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5662.179999999999s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5662.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5663.86s)]
*  Yeah three times. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5664.46s)]
*  And he actually defended the title more than anybody ever has in that division. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5665.46s)]
*  Do you think his neck was stronger. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5668.299999999999s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5670.46s)]
*  Like it was stronger than prior to the injury. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5671.339999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5675.259999999999s)]
*  No no no no. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5676.099999999999s)]
*  No not as strong as like if he's not injured. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5677.54s)]
*  He wasn't like the bionic man that was rebuilt stronger. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5679.74s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5682.7s)]
*  But it might be the same. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5683.900000000001s)]
*  It might be that his neck is the same. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5686.02s)]
*  You strengthen your neck comes from obviously the structure the bones but it also comes from working your neck out. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5687.62s)]
*  You know like there's a bunch of exercises that guys do to strengthen their neck. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5694.3s)]
*  And sometimes when guys don't do that then they run into problems like bulging discs. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5697.46s)]
*  But you're going to run into those anyway in combat sports. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5701.54s)]
*  It's inevitable. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5703.860000000001s)]
*  But I know of many many many many people now that have sought help particularly overseas whether it is in Peru or Panama rather Columbia or Tijuana the CPI Institute Tijuana. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5705.259999999999s)]
*  I know there's bio accelerator in Colombia that's very good. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5719.0199999999995s)]
*  They've taken care of a lot of UFC athletes. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5721.78s)]
*  A lot of guys get stuff fixed. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5723.86s)]
*  Why can't this stuff be approved in the US. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5725.46s)]
*  My suspicion is the same suspicion when you see the influence that these pharmaceutical drug companies have over the FDA. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5728.74s)]
*  My suspicion is that there is probably been an analysis done of what would happen if stem cell use was ubiquitous. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5735.74s)]
*  What would happen if it was everywhere. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5744.82s)]
*  What would happen if you allowed people to use stem cells the way we have trouble. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5747.46s)]
*  Well maybe. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5752.34s)]
*  But certainly more people would get healed. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5754.42s)]
*  More people would get fixed. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5757.5s)]
*  Like I don't know of anyone who has had and this is just my own anecdotal experience. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5758.9s)]
*  I don't know of anyone's that bad experiences with stem cells. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5763.54s)]
*  I've had people that I know that did it and it didn't help them. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5766.9s)]
*  But upon further examination either their problem was too big and it required surgery or in the most part we're dealing with like fighters and a lot of these guys just don't wait long enough before they go hard. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5770.3s)]
*  They go back and they train hard. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5782.94s)]
*  They have like a knee issue or shoulder issue and they go back and train. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5784.42s)]
*  They train. They're too savage. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5788.1s)]
*  They get right back into it as soon as they start feeling good. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5789.66s)]
*  And you really need a lot of time for it to take root in many many months for it to really heal. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5792.34s)]
*  But like I've said many times on the show and I told you earlier I had a full length rotator cuff tear. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5798.22s)]
*  My doctor assured me I was going to need surgery. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5803.1s)]
*  But why were you able to do it in the US. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5805.18s)]
*  It was different. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5807.58s)]
*  It was there was different regulations when I did it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5808.5s)]
*  I don't remember exactly what mesenchymal stem cells and they used exosomes. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5811.299999999999s)]
*  I don't exactly remember like what it all was. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5815.86s)]
*  But I know I remember that it's all processed from umbilical cords. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5818.98s)]
*  So say if a young lady like and I think you have to be 25 years or younger has a baby through a C-section then they harvest their umbilical cord. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5822.46s)]
*  I don't know they sell it or whatever and then they convert that into stem cells. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5832.86s)]
*  And that is unique particularly unique in its ability to help heal any kind of tissue. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5836.38s)]
*  But the difference between what you're allowed to do in America now is different from what it was back then. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5842.46s)]
*  But also the stuff they're doing in these other places overseas is much more dramatic because they can they can use much larger doses and they keep you there for three days. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5847.3s)]
*  And they also combine it with hyperbaric therapy and a bunch of other different things that also accelerate your healing and a D.I.V. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5856.26s)]
*  drips a bunch of different things that help along the process of your healing. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5863.02s)]
*  And I know many people that have avoided surgery because of that and now we're back to 100 percent. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5866.74s)]
*  But doesn't mean you don't need surgery like there's certain disc issues that are ruptured beyond the point of repair and you probably need something done. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5872.46s)]
*  And it's nice that there is all these different options. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5880.74s)]
*  You just you have to be careful you know whenever you're getting something that's an operation like especially if you're getting a replacement like a knee replacement or something. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5883.18s)]
*  All that stuff you got to be careful. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5892.22s)]
*  But you think that it's possible that the FDA is being coerced by other forces to keep this shit out of the. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5893.58s)]
*  I absolutely don't know. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5901.74s)]
*  Right. I'm but it's possible. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5903.42s)]
*  I think if it's possible that a human being a lone human being could be taken into a hotel room and for a couple of days and then comes out and he has a four hundred thousand dollar a year job after he retires. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5905.22s)]
*  And this revolving door does exist. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5919.18s)]
*  We know that we know that exists. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5921.62s)]
*  Why wouldn't you protect your interests by stopping some sort of a novel new sort of treatment that may lead to way less people on pain medication. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5924.74s)]
*  Way less people that need anti-inflammatories way less people that need a lot of the stuff you sell. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5936.18s)]
*  It makes sense to me. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5941.74s)]
*  And then you go oh the dangers of stem cells but oxycontin is safe and effective. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5943.42s)]
*  Like that's so nuts. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5948.54s)]
*  That's so nuts that they say that because we're the dangers where the bodies we are. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5951.06s)]
*  Where the bodies. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5956.26s)]
*  I haven't heard about stem cell addiction. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5957.1s)]
*  I haven't heard of stem cell overdoses. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5961.62s)]
*  Yeah. Where the bodies where the bodies. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5963.82s)]
*  I have a bunch of anecdotal stories from UFC fighters jujitsu athletes good friends of mine. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5966.18s)]
*  A lot of them like dozens of guys who have gone and had massive relief from stem cells. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5973.38s)]
*  Yeah I got a buddy in the UFC right now who just just went down to I think Bogota. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5981.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5985.900000000001s)]
*  Because I have I have some back issues. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5986.9400000000005s)]
*  Go down there. Yeah I will. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5989.42s)]
*  You should. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5990.66s)]
*  But what I want to do when I do or Panama it just sounds so crazy I'm going to go to Tijuana and fix my back. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5991.18s)]
*  I know it sounds it sounds wrong but I'm starting to believe that it's not. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=5996.82s)]
*  I think we have a fucked up system. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6001.98s)]
*  I think I really really do. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6003.5s)]
*  And the process to making that stuff legal they're in the process of doing that. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6004.94s)]
*  Dr. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6009.0599999999995s)]
*  Neil Reardon is deeply involved in this. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6009.46s)]
*  He's the guy that I had on with Mel Gibson back in the day and Mel talked about his own injuries that he got fixed with stem cells and his dad. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6011.139999999999s)]
*  He says his dad was in a wheelchair. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6017.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6019.38s)]
*  And then you know like a few years later his dad's walking around. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6019.7s)]
*  He's where did Mel go. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6022.42s)]
*  They went to Panama and Dr. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6023.38s)]
*  Reardon he was like the first guy that I ever talked to about this stuff and he's written many published papers and books on it. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6026.3s)]
*  And very very very knowledgeable guy when it comes to this and they're absolutely convinced that it's beneficial and we should be using it everywhere. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6031.9s)]
*  But so like one of the things that I don't think anyone really understands that hasn't done it is like OK we're going to go get stem cell therapy and wherever in Panama. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6040.3s)]
*  What does that mean like you like you fly from Panama. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6049.74s)]
*  You drive to some like established looking clinic or is it like in the back of a strip mall. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6055.139999999999s)]
*  No no no no no. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6060.58s)]
*  Like what. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6061.38s)]
*  It's in a very. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6061.780000000001s)]
*  I sent my mom there twice. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6062.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6064.3s)]
*  In Panama. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6064.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6065.3s)]
*  I sent my mom. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6065.9800000000005s)]
*  Well you should leave with that. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6066.62s)]
*  Yes I should have told you that earlier. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6068.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6069.66s)]
*  Yeah my mom had really good success with it with her knee. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6070.62s)]
*  But when you go there. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6073.22s)]
*  Believe in it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6075.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6076.34s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6077.14s)]
*  It's a nice area where you where their their clinic is is very nice. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6078.02s)]
*  It's in a beautiful office building. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6081.900000000001s)]
*  They take you there for three days and you sleep like so is it. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6083.9400000000005s)]
*  You go to a hotel. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6087.18s)]
*  So you. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6087.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a hotel there. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6088.62s)]
*  There's a hotel right next to it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6089.46s)]
*  And what the treatment is what it's an injection. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6090.94s)]
*  It's a series of injections in wherever the injury is along with IV infusions. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6093.58s)]
*  They do IV stem cells as well which helps your whole body like whatever little weird aches and tears you have. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6098.58s)]
*  My friend Gordon Ryan who's the best jiu jitsu athlete of all time. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6105.82s)]
*  He had an issue with his shoulder so he got injections in his shoulder and it fixed his neck. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6109.42s)]
*  He had a neck problem for like a year. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6114.7s)]
*  And just by the fact that it's in the area it literally goes to where it's in trouble. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6116.58s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6121.9s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6122.42s)]
*  Fixed his neck. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6122.82s)]
*  He's like there's no other explanation. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6123.7s)]
*  He's like four weeks later my neck was better. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6125.1s)]
*  I always felt that the one of the greatest recoveries from an injury that I've ever witnessed. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6127.18s)]
*  I'm interested to hear what yours is. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6133.66s)]
*  I was at the fight when Silva cracked his leg. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6135.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6139.82s)]
*  Chris Wideman Chris against Wideman. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6142.02s)]
*  And I was there. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6144.46s)]
*  I was like up front and I heard it and I heard him scream and I saw it. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6145.38s)]
*  Right. You were there. Yeah. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6150.26s)]
*  Yeah I was there. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6151.42s)]
*  How did he recover from that in fighting it. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6152.78s)]
*  Well he did but he didn't. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6156.06s)]
*  In my mind I think Anderson Silva is the greatest middleweight of all time right up there with Adesanya. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6159.22s)]
*  I think Adesanya and Anderson it's like different eras but god damn when they were on top. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6163.82s)]
*  I mean Anderson was. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6170.62s)]
*  Just in the matrix. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6172.86s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6175.58s)]
*  He was such an assassin in his prime. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6177.42s)]
*  People forgot how great he was top five of all. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6179.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6183.02s)]
*  Top three of all. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6183.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6185.1s)]
*  I don't like a Mount Rushmore because there's only room for four heads. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6185.82s)]
*  Yeah I need there's a lot more because you have to have hoist grace. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6188.7s)]
*  But maybe a Mount Rushmore. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6190.9400000000005s)]
*  He's one of the greatest of all time. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6192.58s)]
*  OK. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6193.7s)]
*  Anderson. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6194.06s)]
*  How did he recover from that. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6194.58s)]
*  But he didn't. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6195.82s)]
*  He was never the same guy. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6196.9400000000005s)]
*  He did. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6198.3s)]
*  But if you watch Anderson Silva pre-quick Chris Weidman pre leg break and then post leg break it's a different athlete. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6198.98s)]
*  He can't kick the same way with that leg anymore. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6208.86s)]
*  I bet it doesn't move as well. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6210.98s)]
*  I bet there's issues in terms of like load balance and like the way it feels. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6213.62s)]
*  It's probably in pain all the time. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6218.5s)]
*  There's a lot of factors. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6221.179999999999s)]
*  You're probably very hesitant to throw that same kick again because you just had your leg [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6222.259999999999s)]
*  leg snap in half and your leg was fucked up for a good solid year and a half after that. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6228.0199999999995s)]
*  And you had to have surgery and there's plates in there and rods and shit screws. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6233.46s)]
*  Did he win. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6237.94s)]
*  He won fights after that fights afterwards. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6239.46s)]
*  Not as many. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6241.38s)]
*  No. I mean what is Anderson's record to pull up Anderson's record. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6242.7s)]
*  And again this is not in disrespect of Anderson because I mean Chris Weidman just came back from a knee break too or a leg break as well rather. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6246.0599999999995s)]
*  And it was just last weekend. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6253.0599999999995s)]
*  Is that the worst injury that you've ever seen in UFC. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6254.46s)]
*  Selva. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6257.58s)]
*  Well I saw it with Weidman the same exact injury. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6259.06s)]
*  He snapped his own leg too which is crazy that Anderson was involved. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6261.26s)]
*  So look at look at that. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6265.62s)]
*  Go scroll up. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6266.9800000000005s)]
*  OK so Derek Brunson was his last win and that was in 2017. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6268.34s)]
*  Then he lost to Israel Arasanya Jared Cananier and Uriah Hall. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6273.9400000000005s)]
*  And then there's the loss of Michael Bisbee. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6279.02s)]
*  So you go like from Chris Weidman. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6280.9400000000005s)]
*  So the Nate the Nick Diaz fight was kind of crazy. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6283.98s)]
*  That was July 2013. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6286.54s)]
*  Yeah I think that was no contest because. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6288.5s)]
*  So you got two years or a year and a half from the Weidman leg break till he fights Nick Diaz again. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6291.099999999999s)]
*  And I think what is that no contest because like I think Selva tested positive for steroids. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6296.9s)]
*  Yes still Selva tested positive for steroids which makes sense because he's recovering from this horrific leg injury. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6302.5s)]
*  You know like when you when you there's no way you're going to do that clean and come back in a year and a half. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6308.94s)]
*  You need help. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6314.0199999999995s)]
*  You need like that's the legit reason for those kind of steroids. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6315.0599999999995s)]
*  So if you go before that though you go before the Weidman fight. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6318.5s)]
*  Look at these fucking wins. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6323.339999999999s)]
*  I mean Stefan Bonner Chailson and Yushin Okami Vitor Belfort Chailson and Damien Maia Forrest Griffin. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6325.54s)]
*  Paulas Leitez Patrick Cote James Irvin. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6330.7s)]
*  It's just KO KO KO submission KO. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6333.0599999999995s)]
*  Rich Franklin KO Nate Marquardt KO Travis Luthor submission. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6336.82s)]
*  Rich Franklin KO Chris Liebman KO Tony Fricklin KO. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6341.86s)]
*  I mean he's just dominating everyone. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6346.0199999999995s)]
*  And then what after. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6348.38s)]
*  And after the leg break. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6349.74s)]
*  Look he won one fight after the leg break. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6351.06s)]
*  He's got the no contest which was kind of a boring fight anyway. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6353.98s)]
*  But then you got lost loss one win a decision. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6358.06s)]
*  You're right. Derek Brunson lost lost lost. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6362.3s)]
*  You're right. He was never the same again. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6364.34s)]
*  He was never the same again. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6366.38s)]
*  If the Anderson Silva that smoked Forrest Griffin the Anderson Silva that [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6367.66s)]
*  destroyed Vitor Belfort the Anderson Silva that just dominated that division. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6371.820000000001s)]
*  He was never really that guy again. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6375.9800000000005s)]
*  The Anderson Silva that beat Dan Henderson. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6377.46s)]
*  He was never that guy again. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6379.62s)]
*  And I think that it's a very very very very difficult injury to come back from and be 100 percent. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6380.9800000000005s)]
*  What what are your thoughts on. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6387.9800000000005s)]
*  And I've talked to Dana about it like. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6390.42s)]
*  What what you know we talk you talk about. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6395.42s)]
*  I've done work with the NFL on brain injury and worked on changing the way [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6398.9800000000005s)]
*  football players tackle started a heads up tackling program with with kids trying [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6405.58s)]
*  get them to stop leading with their heads for for brain injury and for paralysis. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6412.42s)]
*  I've seen both and worked in that space a bit. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6417.5s)]
*  And you know what. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6420.58s)]
*  What what are your thoughts on on where what what what we're going to see in the [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6423.099999999999s)]
*  in the UFC with some of these fighters in five ten years. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6428.58s)]
*  Like what. You know I work with a lot of boxers and I've seen a lot of boxers have [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6432.179999999999s)]
*  a rough time obviously as as they get as they get older and they get out of it. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6437.5s)]
*  What what what do you think the long term [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6442.62s)]
*  ramifications for fighters in their their their brains are when they get out. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6445.339999999999s)]
*  It is absolutely never good to get hit in the head. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6450.38s)]
*  Yeah we all know that to deny that is crazy. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6454.54s)]
*  But this sport is you trying to hit someone in the head and them trying to hit you. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6458.34s)]
*  And it's a fucking insane sport. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6463.700000000001s)]
*  It's you trying to strangle them. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6465.62s)]
*  You trying to get them to not hit you. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6466.9800000000005s)]
*  You try to take them down. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6468.62s)]
*  You try to submit them. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6469.780000000001s)]
*  But it's this this part of the sport a big part of the sport is getting hit in the [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6471.18s)]
*  head and some of these guys are getting kicked in the head. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6476.22s)]
*  And if you've ever seen someone get kicked in the head and I've seen a lot. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6480.740000000001s)]
*  It is a terrifying moment. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6485.02s)]
*  You know when a guy like Leon Edwards in the fifth round takes out [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6487.46s)]
*  Kamaru Usman is like one of the greatest of all time with one kick. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6490.9800000000005s)]
*  That's when you realize like oh my God what a ferocious weapon a shin to your neck is. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6494.900000000001s)]
*  I mean it's crazy. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6501.46s)]
*  I can't watch people get hit by those things. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6502.900000000001s)]
*  There's no way that's good for you. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6504.86s)]
*  That is definitely bad for you. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6507.139999999999s)]
*  The question is how bad and how much how much damage have you taken. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6508.74s)]
*  What steps have you made in camp to mitigate the the less to to mitigate the [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6512.7s)]
*  amount of damage that you take and in camp to expand camp. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6519.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6523.74s)]
*  And you have to make sure when you spar in camp that you are being very careful [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6524.22s)]
*  that you are you're not going to war that you're not getting. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6528.78s)]
*  There's a lot of fights where guys have gotten big concussions before they fought [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6531.18s)]
*  and then when they fought the first punch that hits them they go out even punches [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6536.58s)]
*  that don't even look like a devastating punch but they're so damaged already going [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6540.1s)]
*  into the fight because they trained too hard. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6546.06s)]
*  They got beat up and then there's there's this intangible thing where sometimes guys [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6548.42s)]
*  have an iron jaw literally you can't knock them out and then one day it goes. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6553.14s)]
*  And when it goes it's gone forever. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6558.660000000001s)]
*  When it goes they get knocked out a bunch of times after that. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6560.58s)]
*  And that's that seems to be indicative of something wrong something seriously wrong. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6563.18s)]
*  What that is. I'm not a neurologist. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6570.18s)]
*  I'm not sure. It's got to be damaged to your brain. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6572.1s)]
*  It's got to be damaged. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6574.9400000000005s)]
*  It's your body. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6576.34s)]
*  It's you're not durable anymore for some reason. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6577.26s)]
*  And that's the tip of the iceberg. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6580.46s)]
*  The long term effects are like severe cognitive decline. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6583.18s)]
*  It's pugilistic dementia. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6587.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah it's trauma induced Parkinson's. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6590.0599999999995s)]
*  Some boxers like Freddie Roach has. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6593.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6595.139999999999s)]
*  It's a it's a reality of the sport. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6595.94s)]
*  And you would hope that they have friends that can have that long hard talk with them [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6599.299999999999s)]
*  when it's over and say this is not it. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6605.419999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying this because you know [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6608.339999999999s)]
*  for any reason other than you you literally have to be told this. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6612.66s)]
*  You got to get out now. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6616.82s)]
*  Or you're not going to be normal in 10 years. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6618.74s)]
*  Like I have run into old boxers [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6621.82s)]
*  guys that were younger than me. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6625.22s)]
*  And I ran into Terry Norris once who was I was a giant fan of Terry Norris. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6626.94s)]
*  He was so fucking good. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6631.26s)]
*  And I ran into him at a fight and he slurred his words so bad. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6633.18s)]
*  They did a whole news piece on him where he talked about it and his wife is helping him. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6637.54s)]
*  And he's gotten better since then. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6641.98s)]
*  But the struggle that you see like one of the fucking great welterweight champions ever. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6644.099999999999s)]
*  And then you see like how he's dealing with things. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6649.58s)]
*  Was he 154? I'm not sure. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6652.179999999999s)]
*  But you see how he's dealing with things now. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6653.98s)]
*  It's like God was it worth it. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6656.219999999999s)]
*  I don't know man. I don't know. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6657.82s)]
*  Yeah. I mean I was thinking I saw you had Terrence Crawford on the other day who I [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6659.78s)]
*  loved so much he's amazing and he just seems so sharp and his his defensive skills are [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6664.7s)]
*  great. Yeah. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6669.46s)]

*  Yeah. It would be a tragedy to see a guy that sharp struggle mentally. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6676.02s)]
*  And and I do think it's interesting you know I've worked in boxing for a while. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6681.46s)]
*  I have a gym and I manage some fighters and and where is it. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6685.9s)]

*  And then we were wild card west forever. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6702.94s)]
*  We've had Alvarez did four camps at our gym. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6705.259999999999s)]

*  I was in Albuquerque making Lone Survivor and the gym was falling apart. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6719.7s)]
*  And and it was just a fucking headache to have a boxing gym. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6725.74s)]
*  It's a real headache. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6729.18s)]

*  I got to shut this down. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6770.9s)]
*  And you know Gary Shanley was a partner of mine in the gym. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6772.219999999999s)]

*  It's it's too much of a headache. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6782.86s)]
*  It's just nothing but a liability all the time. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6784.5s)]
*  And I'm in the gym by myself getting my last day there. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6786.86s)]
*  I'm going to go back to New Mexico and it's clean and I'm kind of looking at it. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6791.42s)]

*  And I love boxing. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6797.9s)]
*  I'm like I got to shut it down. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6799.46s)]
*  And in the mirror I see this like little flash of red in the mirror and I see [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6801.34s)]

*  This is before you know he'd really taken up but he was emerging right. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6835.42s)]
*  And I'm like yeah you can train here. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6840.26s)]

*  It's not much. It's a ring and our heavy bags are speed bags. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6849.3s)]
*  Here's our sauna. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6852.46s)]
*  He looks around and goes OK. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6853.42s)]
*  Could I could I train here. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6854.700000000001s)]
*  I go yeah. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6855.900000000001s)]
*  He goes out. There's two Suburbans out in the parking lot full of his camp. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6856.660000000001s)]
*  Eddie and Chepo's trainers five fighters. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6860.820000000001s)]
*  They're like come on. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6864.34s)]
*  And they all come running in turn on the music start eating. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6865.42s)]
*  And he came in and started doing his camps there. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6869.5s)]
*  And that got that got my gym going like once he came to gym. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6872.58s)]
*  And we've had everyone do camps there. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6878.1s)]
*  And I've had a front row seat to boxing. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6881.26s)]
*  And man like one of the many things that I look at is how hard it is for these guys to let go. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6884.38s)]
*  So you talk about Terry Norris staying a little bit too long. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6892.74s)]
*  Freddie Roach stayed in the ring probably a few too many fights. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6897.38s)]
*  Ali certainly did right. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6900.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6902.1s)]
*  And like watching these guys. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6902.5s)]
*  And we have a lot of UFC guys have come in and worked on their boxing in our gym and seeing the struggles that they go through. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6906.42s)]
*  And you hope yeah like there's someone that's going to say OK enough. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6916.62s)]
*  It's time. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6920.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6921.66s)]
*  But man is it hard to let go of that. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6922.18s)]
*  It's very hard to let go. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6924.74s)]
*  And I think there's an also there's a bunch of factors at play. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6926.38s)]
*  At play in that one of them is their identity that their identity is all wrapped up in them being a fighter. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6930.94s)]
*  It's very hard for people to let that go. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6937.7s)]
*  Also it's the only thing they've ever dedicated their time to. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6940.42s)]
*  A lot of these guys don't have like serious other side jobs or serious other side professions. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6943.58s)]
*  Some of them do some of the really smart ones. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6950.54s)]
*  They kind of they break off and they start little businesses and they do stuff so that they buy like Eric Anders guy's been on the podcast before he's invested in real estate bought a bunch of houses. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6952.66s)]
*  So he's good forever. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6962.66s)]
*  UFC or boxing. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6963.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6964.86s)]
*  So some guys are smart like that. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6965.62s)]
*  You know Conor McGregor obviously did. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6967.18s)]
*  He's very smart. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6968.66s)]
*  I mean Conor started that whiskey company did the Floyd Mayweather fight he made 100 million dollars and starts his whiskey company is worth like a half a billion. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6969.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6975.94s)]
*  He doesn't have to do shit forever. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6976.18s)]
*  And he's only fighting if he fights again because he wants to. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6977.9s)]
*  But most of them when it's over they're they're confused. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6980.780000000001s)]
*  They don't know what to do. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6986.22s)]
*  And the high of winning a fight is like nothing else in all sports. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6987.5s)]
*  It's there's no other because you might lose. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6993.780000000001s)]
*  And if you lose it's going to be more devastating than anything else in sports. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=6996.7s)]
*  If you lose a basketball game I'm sure it sucks. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7000.22s)]
*  I'm sure you feel terrible. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7002.9400000000005s)]
*  But you can go home. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7004.02s)]
*  You don't go to the fucking hospital with your face battered in and the whole world saw you get kicked in the face and there's memes of you getting flatlined and there's like animation of you getting knocked into orbit and you have to have all these trolls and haters talk shit about you on Twitter when you got knocked out in a world championship fight in front of the whole world. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7005.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And if you're if you're on a basketball team or a football team or any other sport really at least you know guess what I'm playing next Tuesday. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7024.0199999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7032.179999999999s)]
*  I'm playing and I got a contract. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7032.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7034.34s)]
*  And I got a player gene. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7034.820000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7036.1s)]
*  And I got a whole bunch of stuff and I got a lead like. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7036.62s)]
*  Yeah it is a lone wolf sport. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7039.42s)]
*  It's for people that don't play well with others. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7041.820000000001s)]
*  It's for people that also value the camaraderie of other people that are similar to them. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7045.22s)]
*  And like what gets me with boxing which is like you know UFC at least there's an organizing principle uniting it right. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7049.26s)]
*  Like there's the UFC. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7057.9400000000005s)]
*  There's Dana. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7059.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7060.900000000001s)]
*  There's you as part of the face of the UFC. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7061.46s)]
*  There's owners that have you know built a system. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7064.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7068.38s)]
*  Right. I think Frank Lorenzo did a really good job of giving birth to. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7068.700000000001s)]
*  But like boxing it's like how many weight classes are in boxing today. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7073.46s)]
*  Can you name them all. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7078.860000000001s)]
*  There's a lot. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7080.06s)]
*  I don't think that's a bad thing. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7081.18s)]
*  Oh come on. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7082.780000000001s)]
*  I don't. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7083.58s)]
*  How about the how about how about multiple promoters and multiple. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7084.06s)]
*  That's an issue. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7087.58s)]
*  And multiple belts like too many belts. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7088.26s)]
*  Too many promoters. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7091.219999999999s)]
*  So like you've got you've got four hundred and forty pound champions that are all promoted by different guys and then four hundred and forty seven pound champions. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7092.7s)]
*  And so there's no continuity of organization to our. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7104.62s)]
*  That is absolutely true. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7108.98s)]
*  When we get to a level like a guy like Terrence Crawford who is the only man to ever be undisputed in two weight classes which is pretty insane. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7111.179999999999s)]
*  That no one else has just been like Manny Pacquiao. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7120.38s)]
*  I love him so much. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7123.26s)]
*  He's so good man. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7124.3s)]
*  He's such a great guy too. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7125.42s)]
*  Manny Pacquiao won world titles in eight different weight classes. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7126.900000000001s)]
*  I mean that's insane. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7132.22s)]
*  How many world titles did Manny Pacquiao win. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7134.620000000001s)]
*  Let's put let's pull that up. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7136.660000000001s)]
*  Look at his body progression from when he started to when he ended. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7137.820000000001s)]
*  He got saucy. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7141.780000000001s)]
*  Something was going on. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7142.820000000001s)]
*  He got saucy. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7143.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7146.620000000001s)]
*  Like wow. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7147.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7148.34s)]
*  OK. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7149.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7150.26s)]
*  Twelve major world titles in eight different weight divisions. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7151.139999999999s)]
*  That is so insane. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7155.3s)]
*  Those accomplishments are so insane. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7156.78s)]
*  But what were the weight. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7159.42s)]
*  What did he start like one eighteen and went up to one forty seven. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7161.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7165.34s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7166.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7167.42s)]
*  I think his first one was. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7167.94s)]
*  So it's first one was fly weight. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7170.62s)]
*  What is that. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7172.94s)]
*  That one fit. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7173.58s)]
*  Is it one twenty six in the UFC. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7174.22s)]
*  It's different. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7176.86s)]
*  I think it's lighter than I think it's like what's Bantam weight one twenty six. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7177.5s)]
*  What is Bantam weight. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7182.219999999999s)]
*  Well lightweight is one thirty five. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7182.98s)]
*  This is my point. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7185.259999999999s)]
*  There's too many super featherweight is one thirty super. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7186.179999999999s)]
*  So featherweight must be one twenty five and then Bantam eight must be one twenty. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7190.46s)]
*  And fly away. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7197.86s)]
*  It's like one eighteen. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7198.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7201.5s)]
*  There's weird numbers right like welterweight one forty seven. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7201.94s)]
*  Don't think there's too many weight classes. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7204.58s)]
*  Here's the here's the deal. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7207.3s)]
*  The thing about weight cutting weight cutting is so bad for you. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7209.3s)]
*  It's so bad. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7213.18s)]
*  But when there's only a few weight classes there's massive advantages. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7214.46s)]
*  And one of the best ways to disincentivize weight cutting which is as bad as anything [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7218.62s)]
*  else to sport might be as bad as the strikes that you take with some guys. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7224.22s)]
*  Like I've seen guys that look like they're on death. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7228.7s)]
*  I say more. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7230.9s)]
*  But they are. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7231.9s)]
*  That's door. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7232.66s)]
*  They are. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7233.26s)]
*  They are on death's door. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7233.98s)]
*  And then 24 hours later they have a cage fight which is so nuts. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7234.94s)]
*  And but the problem is if you're a guy and you know you're five foot nine and you [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7238.66s)]
*  want to fight in the welterweight division. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7245.5s)]
*  Can you make fifty five because if you can make fifty five dude it would be better [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7249.78s)]
*  for you because if you make fifty five like those guys would be your height like [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7253.66s)]
*  you're you're you're dealing with if you can come down to one if you make one fifty [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7257.34s)]
*  five then those guys will probably be your size because if you just walk around [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7261.1s)]
*  like one hundred and eighty pounds you want to fight at one seventy you're [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7266.900000000001s)]
*  dealing with guys that are two hundred plus and then they suck down to one seventy [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7269.42s)]
*  for a very brief amount of time. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7273.540000000001s)]
*  And then when you get in that octagon and they're fully hydrated and you look at [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7274.9800000000005s)]
*  them like Jesus they're so much bigger than one seventy. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7278.540000000001s)]
*  The rehydration is crazy. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7281.860000000001s)]
*  So but my point is if there is multiple weight classes in between that gap you [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7283.700000000001s)]
*  wouldn't have to do that. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7287.74s)]
*  I think there should be at the very minimum a weight class every 10 pounds and I [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7289.0199999999995s)]
*  don't think that's outrageous and that's way less than boxing. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7293.3s)]
*  But you would start at one twenty five like there is now and one thirty five which [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7295.94s)]
*  already exists one forty five already exists and then you go fifty five which [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7299.86s)]
*  already exists sixty five sixty five seventy five eighty five ninety five two [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7304.0199999999995s)]
*  five maybe two fifteen or just go right to two twenty five and then maybe even a [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7309.86s)]
*  two sixty five and then super heavyweight which doesn't exist which is really wild [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7315.94s)]
*  that the heavyweight champion the UFC has to make weight like the heavyweight [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7321.0199999999995s)]
*  champion the UFC has to be two hundred sixty five pounds or less. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7324.0199999999995s)]
*  Why? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7327.98s)]
*  Because there's a weight class but why there's a super heavyweight. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7328.74s)]
*  Oh there's a super heavyweight but it's never been used. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7332.0199999999995s)]
*  Has there ever been a 300 pound fighter? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7334.5s)]
*  In the early days of the UFC for sure. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7336.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah Paul Varlins I think was 300 pounds one of the really early ones when he fought [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7338.219999999999s)]
*  Marco who lost. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7341.86s)]

*  He was an elite wrestler. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7352.5s)]
*  I thought that would be a good film. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7354.379999999999s)]
*  Who was on all the juicy juice. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7355.299999999999s)]

*  There is one out. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7359.62s)]
*  Documentary. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7361.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah the Smashing Machine. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7362.219999999999s)]
*  You ever seen it? [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7363.54s)]
*  No but I meant I meant a scripted. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7364.299999999999s)]
*  Oh scripted. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7366.299999999999s)]
*  I know Dwayne Johnson was interested in playing him for a minute. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7367.66s)]
*  He's the one that turned me on to him. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7370.82s)]
*  They called him the Smashing Machine. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7373.099999999999s)]
*  Is that the best fight name ever? [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7374.74s)]
*  Oh so good. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7376.86s)]
*  I saw him submit a guy with his chin in the guy's eye socket. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7377.62s)]
*  It was an early early early UFC. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7383.02s)]
*  He he mountain this guy this guy Dan Bulbish and he stuck his chin in the guy's eye socket. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7385.54s)]
*  He just fucking drove his chin. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7392.18s)]
*  It was then. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7394.62s)]
*  Is it now? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7395.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7396.34s)]
*  No one's ever done it before. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7397.06s)]
*  But also no one's on the same amount of sauce as Kerr was. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7398.18s)]
*  Kerr was. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7401.78s)]
*  He looked like a superhero. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7402.62s)]
*  He didn't look like a real person. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7404.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7406.18s)]
*  Super nice guy by the way. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7406.7s)]
*  Sweet guy. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7408.86s)]
*  I think it does not make sense when you talk to him his personality that he's such a murderer. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7409.5s)]
*  I think he had the wrong woman in his life. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7413.7s)]
*  As I recall. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7416.42s)]
*  That was a part of it. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7417.74s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7418.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7420.26s)]
*  No but I think he's a paint guy. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7420.58s)]
*  Yeah I think he got hooked on paint pills. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7423.42s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7425.54s)]
*  It would be an interesting film. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7426.26s)]
*  Well it would be interesting because I think if have you seen the Smashing Machine. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7427.900000000001s)]
*  I haven't. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7430.900000000001s)]
*  I will. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7431.54s)]
*  I'll watch it. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7431.78s)]
*  That's why you don't know. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7432.58s)]
*  He was addicted to paint pills. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7433.62s)]
*  Yeah I knew that. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7435.26s)]
*  A painkiller. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7435.9s)]
*  I knew that. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7436.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7437.139999999999s)]
*  That's what happened. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7437.62s)]
*  So what happened to him is very related to your series. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7438.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7441.54s)]
*  I'm going to look at it because someone sent it to me. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7441.86s)]
*  Dwayne sent it to me. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7445.139999999999s)]
*  He was obsessed with them. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7446.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a very interesting story because at one point in time when they were following him they were following him because they thought they were following this unstoppable force in Pride which was the rival organization to the UFC. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7447.5s)]
*  Yeah that's him in his prime. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7461.179999999999s)]
*  Dude. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7462.379999999999s)]
*  What a stud huh. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7462.86s)]
*  He was fucking people up. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7463.9s)]
*  Look at him down there. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7465.379999999999s)]
*  How much. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7466.219999999999s)]
*  That's what he thought. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7466.7s)]
*  That's me interviewing him. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7467.459999999999s)]
*  What. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7468.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7469.0599999999995s)]
*  That's 1997. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7469.7s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7470.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7471.5s)]
*  Like do you remember that interview. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7473.54s)]
*  Yeah I do. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7475.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7475.86s)]
*  Where was that. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7476.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7476.94s)]
*  I only did like a few of these back then. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7478.74s)]
*  Isn't it wild. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7483.259999999999s)]
*  I did it from like 97 to late in the 1998 and then it became. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7484.0199999999995s)]
*  It wasn't cost effective. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7489.139999999999s)]
*  I was losing money and I was like I did it was fun. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7490.42s)]
*  But wait that was a UFC. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7492.58s)]
*  Was that you. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7494.02s)]
*  That was you. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7494.5s)]
*  Yeah I was the post fight interviewer for the UFC from 97 to 98 and then I quit and then I'm doing news radio and then I wound up doing Fear Factor and then Dana White contacted me and was getting me tickets to the fights. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7495.18s)]
*  I was like oh this is amazing. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7511.34s)]
*  The fights are in Vegas now because my friend Eddie and I we'd always had this dream because we always loved the sport. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7512.5s)]
*  We were like you know what would be amazing if like these fucking billionaire dudes just fell in love with the sport and dumped a bunch of money into it. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7518.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7524.5s)]
*  It's exactly what happened. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7525.86s)]
*  And so when they said that they had actually done that I was like oh that's fantastic. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7527.66s)]
*  And so I went and I did some press for them and then I started asking Dana about fights. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7531.5s)]
*  I was like have you ever. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7538.5s)]
*  Do you know about this guy. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7539.54s)]
*  You know what this guy fights in Japan. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7540.5s)]
*  You know about this and that. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7542.0599999999995s)]
*  He's like and he goes you want to do commentary. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7542.9s)]
*  Did he know that you knew so much about it. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7544.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7547.78s)]
*  I don't know what he knew. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7549.0599999999995s)]
*  You know he knew eventually once we started talking I was saying I trained jiu jitsu five days a week and you know I'm obsessed with the sport. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7550.26s)]
*  But look at me with all that hair. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7557.18s)]
*  You look great. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7558.82s)]
*  You still look great Joe. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7559.9s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7560.9s)]
*  But you look great there too. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7561.66s)]
*  Different chapters. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7563.9s)]
*  UFC 15. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7564.86s)]
*  UFC 15. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7565.98s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7567.26s)]
*  1997. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7568.42s)]
*  But see that my theory being you know a big boxing fan. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7569.14s)]
*  We need a couple of billionaires to buy boxing. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7577.14s)]
*  And like it almost happened with his own. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7580.3s)]
*  I don't know if you follow like this guy limbal it Nick the the. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7583.26s)]
*  I didn't follow it. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7587.5s)]
*  A Russian oligarch basically gave Eddie her and his shitload of money and said roll up boxing. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7588.740000000001s)]
*  And I always felt like one guy could have rolled up boxing because it's you know it's controlled by. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7596.34s)]
*  There's there's Al Heyman. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7602.22s)]
*  There's Bob Aram and there's now his own Eddie Hearn. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7605.0199999999995s)]
*  And if someone boy. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7609.38s)]
*  Golden boy. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7611.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7611.94s)]
*  And golden boys lurking around. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7612.339999999999s)]
*  And then there's some. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7614.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's it's actually an asset that if you look at you know what it's all worth it's it's conceivable that one billionaire could come in. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7615.7s)]
*  And for I don't know what the number is. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7624.7s)]
*  Couple of billion buyout everyone roll it up and create one international boxing league. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7627.219999999999s)]
*  Kind of like what you have she's done. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7633.66s)]
*  It's hard. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7635.26s)]
*  But if they did it it's almost like boxing now it's like if there were four different NFL football leagues. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7636.3s)]
*  Right. So there wasn't one Super Lombardi trophy. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7643.18s)]
*  Right. There wasn't one UFC belt. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7645.94s)]
*  How many people don't understand that. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7647.82s)]
*  Like right. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7650.34s)]
*  Oh I'm a UFC. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7651.22s)]
*  I'm a WBL 140 pound champion. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7652.5s)]
*  He's an IBF 140 pound. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7656.98s)]
*  What. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7658.98s)]
*  Right. It's like if one person could roll it up. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7659.78s)]
*  I've asked Dana several times to do it to roll it up. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7663.54s)]
*  How much would it cost. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7666.9s)]
*  I mean I would think you're pretty good at guessing. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7668.22s)]
*  I would say. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7671.3s)]
*  I would say to really roll it up and buy all by all the idea of WBO WBA buyout all the belts and get Eddie this because I put Eddie in charge of it. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7673.7s)]
*  I think he's the smartest guy in boxing Eddie Hearn. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7683.7s)]
*  The face of boxing at this point. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7687.02s)]
*  Bob Arum God love him. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7688.82s)]
*  He's 90. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7690.54s)]
*  Yeah whatever. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7691.58s)]
*  Yeah you got to get Eddie. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7692.58s)]
*  I don't know what Al Heymans experience is what he really. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7693.62s)]
*  De La Hoya. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7697.78s)]
*  Eddie Hearn is like to me the guy I like him knows a lot about boxing. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7698.74s)]
*  You take Eddie and Dana partner him up have Ari broker the whole deal. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7702.86s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7709.42s)]
*  And probably one point two billion buys the whole thing and you then create a league. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7710.26s)]
*  OK. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7717.86s)]
*  Here's what I picked. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7719.98s)]
*  Good idea. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7720.78s)]
*  And then how about this. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7721.46s)]
*  You get what's the biggest fight you could make in UFC right now. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7722.86s)]
*  The biggest fight or a huge fight. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7727.3s)]
*  The biggest. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7731.62s)]
*  Well Francis and Gano just left. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7732.78s)]
*  That would be the biggest fight. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7735.18s)]
*  If you could get Francis and Gano versus John Jones John Jones of Ghana right. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7736.82s)]
*  So yeah I think that would be the biggest. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7741.5s)]
*  What's the best. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7743.18s)]
*  What's your best venue. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7743.9800000000005s)]
*  Is it Vegas. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7745.1s)]
*  Does it matter. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7745.9800000000005s)]
*  Mass is kind of like Madison Square. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7746.9800000000005s)]
*  You can't go wrong with Vegas or Madison Square. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7750.54s)]
*  So let's go. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7752.62s)]
*  Let's go to Madison Square Garden just because I'm from New York. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7753.38s)]
*  OK. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7755.9400000000005s)]
*  So you have that fight and let's think about the biggest fight in boxing right now. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7756.54s)]
*  Is it. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7762.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7764.54s)]
*  Chance Crawford talking about fighting Canelo Crawford Canelo. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7765.42s)]
*  That would be a hundred and what 40 150. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7768.38s)]
*  No no. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7772.62s)]
*  And 50. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7773.78s)]
*  No he's going to go up to 68. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7774.5s)]
*  OK. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7776.9400000000005s)]
*  Crawford was talking about him. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7777.46s)]
*  Yeah you're going to go up to 60. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7778.54s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7779.66s)]
*  I have that. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7780.26s)]
*  Let's say that could happen. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7781.42s)]
*  It's hard for me to imagine that happening right. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7783.1s)]
*  147. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7785.18s)]

*  OK. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7790.1s)]
*  Well he said he met Canelo he's like he's kind of my height. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7790.78s)]
*  Yeah OK. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7793.38s)]

*  Yeah he goes just give me time to put on some weight. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7795.94s)]
*  OK. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7797.94s)]
*  He goes I wouldn't do it immediately. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7798.42s)]
*  All right. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7799.86s)]
*  He goes but I like six months to really put. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7800.14s)]
*  I don't know man. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7802.14s)]
*  I mean look Canelo is a monster. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7803.74s)]
*  He's a monster and his power will be the fact the guy knocked out Kovalev at one [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7805.5s)]
*  seventy five hours unstoppable. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7809.62s)]
*  But so let's say that fight happens. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7812.62s)]
*  You've got Canelo Crawford at whatever weight. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7815.1s)]
*  And you've got Jones. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7817.78s)]
*  In Ghana and Ghana right. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7820.82s)]
*  So you fill up the garden. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7822.46s)]
*  I don't know who goes first. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7824.06s)]
*  Oh my god you have both fights in one night. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7826.34s)]
*  The ring the ring is an octagon. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7827.9s)]
*  You have the UFC fight. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7831.0199999999995s)]
*  You're there. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7832.78s)]
*  Whole thing fight ends the premiere fight. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7833.66s)]
*  The ring lifts up the octagon lifts up. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7836.86s)]
*  Flips over drops a box and down. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7839.38s)]
*  Yes drops a box and ring down. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7843.42s)]
*  And in one night one league Dana owns all of it. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7846.14s)]
*  I pitched him this in Mexico. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7850.7s)]
*  They had one night drunk. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7853.02s)]
*  I'm like you don't understand. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7855.58s)]
*  And he's kind of going for it. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7857.58s)]
*  But but why not. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7859.3s)]

*  Well maybe the Saudis. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7869.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean who has more money than that. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7870.7s)]
*  Nobody. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7872.0599999999995s)]
*  And they're also doing a lot of boxing events now like Tysi Fury [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7872.5s)]
*  versus Francis and Ghana. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7876.139999999999s)]
*  Isn't that in Saudi Arabia. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7877.58s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7878.82s)]

*  And they have a lot of money. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7882.299999999999s)]
*  They could do that. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7884.139999999999s)]
*  So if some maybe someone's listening right now and they'll they'll go you know what. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7884.98s)]

*  And then he started telling me like this. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7910.54s)]
*  You think like we think we know what money is. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7913.3s)]
*  This is where the money is. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7916.660000000001s)]
*  So what this is is some mega city that's many miles long that they're building [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7919.26s)]
*  that's all completely integrated right. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7926.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah it's like one building. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7928.78s)]
*  It's like no roads. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7931.139999999999s)]

*  People's health and well-being will be [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7941.0199999999995s)]
*  prioritized over transportation and infrastructure unlike traditional cities. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7942.66s)]
*  That might be amazing to visit. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7947.099999999999s)]
*  But fuck that did it. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIh6765-BrQ&t=7949.66s)]
