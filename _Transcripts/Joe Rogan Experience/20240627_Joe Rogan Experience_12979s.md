# Joe Rogan Experience #2093 - Sober October Crew
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6.0s)]
*  You looking for me? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10.0s)]
*  You wanted the picture? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=13.0s)]
*  He does it in New York too, where no one wants to talk to anybody. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=16.0s)]
*  Is that the one? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=19.0s)]
*  His Dice Clay's Instagram is performance art. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=20.0s)]
*  They don't appreciate it because performance art is snobby. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=24.0s)]
*  And you think you have to be left leaning, liberal, super fucking progressive. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=27.0s)]
*  That's the only way you can have performance art. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=35.0s)]
*  But no, what Andrew Dice Clay is doing, some of the best wild performance art. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=38.0s)]
*  The hat, the king's hat. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=43.0s)]
*  I saw this one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=45.0s)]
*  The king's hat. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=46.0s)]
*  What about the hat? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=47.0s)]
*  My hat. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=48.0s)]
*  The king's hat. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=49.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=50.0s)]
*  No, I'm saying I can see that you're a fan. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=51.0s)]
*  We're talking about my coworker. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=54.0s)]
*  Oh no, if you wanted a picture, you know, I would take... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=56.0s)]
*  I see that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=60.0s)]
*  A picture? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=62.0s)]

*  No. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=66.0s)]
*  Yes, no? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=67.0s)]
*  You wanted me to take you a picture? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=68.0s)]
*  No, I thought you were a fan and wanted... [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=70.0s)]
*  No, I'm just a super person. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=73.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=75.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=76.0s)]
*  I just saw the king's hat and I haven't even worn it in four years. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=77.0s)]
*  Alright, take care. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=81.0s)]
*  He does this to so many unsuspecting people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=84.0s)]
*  First of all, is this even legal? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=87.0s)]
*  Wait, did you see the one with Matt Damon? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=89.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=92.0s)]
*  He just got Matt Damon. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=93.0s)]
*  He got Matt Damon? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=94.0s)]

*  No. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=96.0s)]
*  Matt Damon. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=97.0s)]
*  Matt Damon's at the fucking airport having a beer and a burger. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=98.0s)]
*  And he goes, thanks. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=102.0s)]
*  You just gotta see it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=104.0s)]
*  It's so fucking good. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=105.0s)]
*  It doesn't feel like anything. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=106.0s)]
*  It's so fucking good. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=108.0s)]
*  And Matt Damon is the sweetest animal alive. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=109.0s)]
*  He just looks at him like, huh? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=112.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=114.0s)]
*  And by the way, Matt Damon's at fucking LAX in Delta just having a burger and a beer like [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=115.0s)]
*  a regular fucking dude. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=120.0s)]
*  He is just hanging out. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=122.0s)]
*  You gotta find the video. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=123.0s)]
*  He seems like a very normal guy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=124.0s)]
*  But he's like, this is why I don't do this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=126.0s)]
*  I've only had a couple interactions with him. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=128.0s)]
*  I think that's fucking Southwest. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=130.0s)]
*  This isn't even a lounge. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=131.0s)]
*  No, it's not a lounge. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=133.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=134.0s)]
*  His face with the glasses. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=135.0s)]
*  The picture with the face. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=138.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=142.0s)]
*  Matt Damon has no fucking idea. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=144.0s)]
*  He has no fucking idea. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=147.0s)]
*  No, here's the question. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=149.0s)]
*  Is that legal? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=150.0s)]
*  Sort of, but it should not be. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=151.0s)]
*  Is that legal? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=153.0s)]
*  You could just take some guy who's working in an upholstery shop. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=154.0s)]
*  And Andrew Dice Clay is like, you wanted the picture? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=157.0s)]
*  He does it on street corners a lot. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=160.0s)]
*  So like you're in public, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=164.0s)]
*  And if you're in public, you can be filmed. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=165.0s)]
*  Which is also wild. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=167.0s)]
*  Which is wild. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=168.0s)]
*  It's kind of wild. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=169.0s)]
*  And you can be filmed against your knowledge. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=171.0s)]
*  It's kind of wild. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=173.0s)]
*  My favorite is when those young white kids do it to just black dudes. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=174.0s)]
*  And then they're like, hey, did you want me to kiss me on the lips? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=179.0s)]
*  And the guy goes, no, you're talking to the wrong motherfucker. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=181.0s)]
*  And he's like, in a second. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=183.0s)]
*  And then he just jaws the dude and knocks him unconscious. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=185.0s)]
*  And you're like, that's even a bunch. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=187.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of those that go sideways. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=189.0s)]
*  They're not really thought out. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=190.0s)]
*  Or there's the fart prank. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=193.0s)]
*  You know, like there's people that do... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=195.0s)]
*  Fart in elevators? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=197.0s)]
*  No, they'll fart like in public. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=198.0s)]
*  But they'll go to like the hood and then like walk up where people are hanging out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=199.0s)]
*  And then just fart. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=204.0s)]
*  And you see black people be like, nah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=205.0s)]
*  And like get up and like chase you. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=207.0s)]
*  It's because it's like you're trying to elicit this reaction. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=209.0s)]
*  Do you remember a Kentucky Five movie? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=214.0s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=215.0s)]
*  It's super dangerous to do that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very, very dangerous. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=217.0s)]
*  Because they don't know that you're doing a prank. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=219.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=222.0s)]
*  They think you're a crazy person. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=223.0s)]
*  And they think you came over. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=225.0s)]
*  They think you get stabbed. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=226.0s)]
*  If someone's that nuts, they just get right in your face out of nowhere with some goofy thing to say. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=227.0s)]
*  And if you're doing the fart one, they think you're like you're coming over to where people are just to fart on someone. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=232.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=238.0s)]
*  It doesn't go well. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=239.0s)]
*  And they're like, no, it's for a prank from YouTube. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=240.0s)]
*  They're like, who's? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=242.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=243.0s)]
*  You just picked the wrong people and they just instantly go into violence. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=244.0s)]
*  Did you see the fucking guy? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=248.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=250.0s)]
*  Remember when you were in Europe where his prank was he pours liquified dog shit on people? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=251.0s)]

*  No, no, no more. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=569.0s)]
*  Come on buddy. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=570.0s)]
*  Come on man. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=571.0s)]
*  This is unprecedented shit out of me. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=572.0s)]
*  That's someone's baby boy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=573.0s)]
*  Someone was playing catch with that kid in the park. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=574.0s)]
*  Wait hold on. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=577.0s)]
*  So when you had like, back in the day you had Jack Dorsey on. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=578.0s)]
*  You've had Zuckerberg on. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=581.0s)]
*  And you've talked about, you know, censorship. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=583.0s)]
*  Like, you know, what gets policed? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=586.0s)]
*  Because it always feels like these big companies have kind of, you know, inconsistent rules [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=588.0s)]
*  about what they do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=593.0s)]
*  Oh, if it's this and this could be misinformation or we don't know if we can verify. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=595.0s)]
*  You know, it never feels like, oh, that's the clear answer. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=599.0s)]
*  But on Instagram there's this thing where like, you know, somebody could say something about whatever. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=602.0s)]
*  A political candidate, maybe COVID or whatever. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=607.0s)]
*  And then people go like, that account is gone. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=610.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=612.0s)]
*  Or it's like, but you and I have a text thread that is pretty horrific. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=613.0s)]
*  That is fueled only by Instagram. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=620.0s)]
*  And you're like, wait, why is all this okay? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=623.0s)]
*  Tom and I every day, Tom and I every day send each other the most horrific shit we find on Instagram. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=626.0s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=632.0s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=633.0s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=634.0s)]
*  It's people getting run over by trains every day. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=635.0s)]
*  It's people getting mauled by animals. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=637.0s)]
*  What do they say? What's the reason? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=639.0s)]
*  Shot. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=640.0s)]
*  Electrocuted, hit by lightning, dump trucks fall on top of them. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=641.0s)]
*  So I asked, so I actually ran into an engineer at Meta two days ago and he was talking to me. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=646.0s)]
*  And I kind of like was like, what's up with this? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=653.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, there's just so many accounts. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=655.0s)]
*  It's hard to, and I'm like, no. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=657.0s)]
*  I go, these are accounts that have been up forever and they just have murders. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=659.0s)]
*  Well, here, not only that, they just show up in my feed and I'm not following them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=663.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, of course. That's the thing. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=668.0s)]
*  It's like the algorithm knows that I've watched that shit. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=670.0s)]
*  He said if you look at something for two seconds, that means they will start sending you. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=672.0s)]
*  So does the algorithm recognize that you like car accidents? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=677.0s)]
*  For sure. Or that you're watching them. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=680.0s)]
*  It's just saying this guy will watch a car. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=682.0s)]
*  It's not enough to like don't click on that because it'll lead to more. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=684.0s)]
*  But my point is that that means that the algorithm recognizes what that video is. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=686.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=692.0s)]
*  So if the algorithm recognizes what that video is and it doesn't flag it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=693.0s)]
*  And it could take it off if it wanted to. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=696.0s)]
*  Right, if it wanted to. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=699.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=700.0s)]
*  But if they wanted to just like not only let the algorithm encourage you to watch it, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=701.0s)]
*  but leave the videos up. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=705.0s)]
*  Because the baseline goal of all those is keep you on the platform. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=707.0s)]
*  We should go back in our text thread like six months and see if any of those videos are still up. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=711.0s)]
*  I bet you a lot are. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=717.0s)]
*  That would be wild. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=719.0s)]
*  Because some of the ones, there's so many war ones. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=720.0s)]
*  There's so many ones of like drones dropping down on people and you're watching their legs blow off. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=723.0s)]
*  I watched a dude get sucked into a sinkhole. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=728.0s)]
*  Oh god yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=730.0s)]
*  I saw a black chick fall into a sinkhole. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=731.0s)]
*  I saw a guy come out of his shit and say that's Florida. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=733.0s)]
*  Sinkholes are crazy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=736.0s)]
*  Like one day your house can just fall into a bottomless pit. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=738.0s)]
*  At a nowhere. The earth collapses underneath where your structure is. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=741.0s)]
*  A car in an intersection. Just swallowed up. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=745.0s)]
*  And you realize that like who do you call? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=747.0s)]
*  Do you think you're like hey I'm mad at the mayor. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=751.0s)]
*  There's nothing you can do. The earth just did it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=754.0s)]
*  Well the reality is asphalt is preposterous. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=757.0s)]
*  It's a ridiculous idea. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=761.0s)]
*  It fucks up erosion. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=763.0s)]
*  It does so many things. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=765.0s)]
*  It fucks up absorption of the water naturally into the ground. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=767.0s)]
*  You're covering everything with rock. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=771.0s)]
*  They're going to call you an anti-faulter. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=774.0s)]
*  And then underneath that what's happening? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=775.0s)]
*  What's happening underneath all that rock? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=778.0s)]
*  I would imagine a lot of that water is moving around in there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=780.0s)]
*  And if it creates a nice little pocket. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=783.0s)]
*  And then you get the weight of all these buildings. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=785.0s)]
*  And then one day just whoosh. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=787.0s)]
*  They just go under dude. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=789.0s)]
*  They've lost blocks. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=791.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen like those crazy giant sinkholes? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=793.0s)]
*  Where like a whole block has fallen into it. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=796.0s)]
*  See if you can find the giant sinkhole. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=798.0s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=800.0s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=802.0s)]
*  That's photoshopped. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=803.0s)]
*  Is that photoshopped? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=805.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=806.0s)]
*  Read the caption. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=807.0s)]
*  Oh no it's real. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=808.0s)]
*  That might be after they imploded it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=809.0s)]
*  No man it might be real. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=811.0s)]
*  It's so deep though. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=813.0s)]
*  Let me double check for another source. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=814.0s)]
*  Yeah let Jamie double check. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=816.0s)]
*  I think that one was real. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=818.0s)]
*  They did a good job with the overhang. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=820.0s)]
*  Look if you're looking at the ground. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=822.0s)]
*  You're thinking the ground. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=824.0s)]
*  If you're looking down right. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=826.0s)]
*  You're thinking the ground. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=828.0s)]
*  I think it's real dude. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=830.0s)]
*  That was the original 9-11 memorial. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=832.0s)]
*  It's insane because it looks like a fucking UFO just went through the earth. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=833.0s)]
*  It looks like a black hole went through the earth. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=836.0s)]
*  It looks so perfectly cut. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=838.0s)]
*  How lucky are you if you're the house on the corner that now has a beautiful view? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=840.0s)]
*  So lucky. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=844.0s)]
*  Bro how much are you thinking about moving? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=845.0s)]
*  How much are you thinking about moving? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=848.0s)]
*  Be careful coming out. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=851.0s)]
*  Be careful leaving. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=853.0s)]
*  It came out in almost a perfect circle. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=854.0s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=856.0s)]
*  Doesn't that make you feel so small in the world though? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=858.0s)]
*  They're just falling and falling and falling and falling. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=863.0s)]
*  Away from there. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=866.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=867.0s)]
*  I would want to get the fuck away from that spot. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=868.0s)]
*  That spot might fall into the earth. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=870.0s)]
*  But it just makes you feel like you're so arrogant to think that any of this is yours. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=872.0s)]
*  The arrogance when the big waves were coming in to California like a month ago about. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=877.0s)]
*  I drove the girls out to go look at the big waves. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=882.0s)]
*  They were fucking massive. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=885.0s)]
*  20 feet. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=886.0s)]
*  It's really impressive. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=887.0s)]
*  It sounds like thunder. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=888.0s)]
*  And Isla got swept out by a wave. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=890.0s)]
*  There's a video of it. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=894.0s)]
*  It's not bad. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=896.0s)]
*  She's fine. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=897.0s)]
*  But it's funny. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=898.0s)]
*  How swept out? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=900.0s)]
*  You can see it. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=902.0s)]
*  She didn't get taken out to sea. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=904.0s)]
*  She got overtaken by a wave. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=906.0s)]
*  And it was funny because it's very light hearted. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=908.0s)]
*  And I don't even think I handed it well as a parent. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=911.0s)]
*  You filmed it and helped? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=914.0s)]
*  I filmed and then said, is your cell phone in your pocket? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=916.0s)]
*  And so but what's crazy is the moment of clarity after that where you go, hold on. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=919.0s)]
*  We're not safe here. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=926.0s)]
*  Like this is oh that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=928.0s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=929.0s)]
*  This is actually really dangerous. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=930.0s)]
*  This is Isla. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=931.0s)]
*  And she just like she was just fucking around. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=932.0s)]
*  And then oh boy. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=935.0s)]
*  And it's like aggressive. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=936.0s)]
*  Of course, we're all laughing. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=939.0s)]
*  She's far enough away where I'm not scared. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=941.0s)]
*  Yeah, sort of. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=944.0s)]
*  But if she slipped further back, that's all coming back. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=945.0s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that like that's one of those, you know, 50, 50 feet here, 50 feet there things. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=947.0s)]
*  Like if you fuck up and you're 50 feet in front of that and you think you can get away. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=954.0s)]
*  I've had multiple ocean scares now. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=958.0s)]
*  Like the ones where you're like. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=960.0s)]
*  Crying on the beach. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=962.0s)]
*  Well, no, just like in the moment. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=963.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=965.0s)]
*  I keep telling myself, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=966.0s)]
*  You know, and one I remember was in Hawaii where we rented a jeep and we were like, we want to go see something. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=968.0s)]
*  You know, so they tell you, oh, take this road and it takes you to this single road that goes up where there used to be volcanoes. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=976.0s)]
*  And we come up on this beach and they had mentioned the beach, but not really too much about it. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=983.0s)]
*  And so when we parked, I was like, I love the ocean water. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=988.0s)]
*  I'm going to get in the ocean, you know, so I get in the ocean and I remember that going in the beach into the water was a decline. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=991.0s)]
*  Right. So like you go down and I was just like knee deep in there about. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=999.0s)]
*  And I was like, man, this current is pulling back hard, like really hard. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1005.0s)]
*  And I kind of take like a step back and I, I feel myself going further down a decline into the ocean. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1009.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1016.0s)]
*  And when I, I, I decided to get out, I have to really push hard, like all legs, like boom, boom, like run, like you're running up a hill to get out. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1017.0s)]
*  And I was like, that was fucking. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1026.0s)]
*  That wave hit you there. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1028.0s)]
*  That was kind of scary. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1029.0s)]
*  It was a guy who's a WWE wrestler. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1031.0s)]
*  They tell me though, when I get back to the hotel, they go, I go, yeah, we took, I go that, that, that beach was, that was a little scary. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1033.0s)]
*  They go, did you get in the water? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1040.0s)]
*  And I go, yeah. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1042.0s)]
*  And they go, oh, you can't get in that water. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1044.0s)]
*  Like you'll drown in that water. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1045.0s)]
*  Did you notice there was nobody swimming there? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1047.0s)]
*  I go, yeah, I noticed. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1048.0s)]
*  I thought it was beautiful. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1049.0s)]
*  I thought I found a fucking. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1050.0s)]
*  Oasis. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1051.0s)]
*  They don't tell you. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1052.0s)]
*  They didn't tell me. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1053.0s)]
*  They're like, do not swim in that water. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1054.0s)]
*  They're like, you can't swim out of that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1056.0s)]
*  If you would, like they're like, if you would swam 10 feet in, they're like, you're just gone. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1058.0s)]
*  You're just gone. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1062.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1063.0s)]
*  And like the panic you feel, especially in retrospect, because you remember the feeling of being like, I think I'm stuck here. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1064.0s)]
*  You know, I think I'm stuck right now. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1069.0s)]
*  Fitzsimmons saved a lady in Thailand. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1070.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1073.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1074.0s)]

*  I might have made up Thailand. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1084.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound like a place Fitzsimmons would go. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1086.0s)]
*  He would go. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1090.0s)]
*  Thailand, no, he would go. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1091.0s)]
*  He's a world traveler. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1092.0s)]
*  He's a Hawaii guy. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1093.0s)]
*  He surfs in Hawaii. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1094.0s)]
*  Wherever it was. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1095.0s)]
*  Fitzsimmons went in the ocean and saved a lady. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1096.0s)]
*  No shit. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1098.0s)]

*  That's a scary thing. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1100.0s)]
*  In a resort. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1101.0s)]
*  It was at the bottom of the pool. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1102.0s)]
*  He was just laying at the bottom of the pool. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1104.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1106.0s)]
*  And I was like nine years old. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1107.0s)]
*  It was like father son who took me to this resort. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1108.0s)]
*  And there's a slide. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1110.0s)]
*  You ever go on a slide where the water that comes off the slide, that like, so in other [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1111.0s)]
*  words, when you hit the water, it's like high impact. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1117.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1120.0s)]
*  And it pushes you down. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1121.0s)]
*  I'm nine years old. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1122.0s)]
*  So this is many years ago. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1123.0s)]
*  And I remember like I could swim. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1125.0s)]
*  I was on swim team like as a little kid. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1127.0s)]
*  But I remember being like, fuck, that is powerful. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1129.0s)]
*  Like it pushes you down. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1132.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1133.0s)]
*  And you just swim up and we're all people are, you know, at the resort and then look [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1134.0s)]
*  down. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1139.0s)]
*  And then my dad swims to the bottom of the pool and pulls up this lifeless body. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1140.0s)]
*  And then they do CPR and she came back. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1147.0s)]
*  Oh, shut up. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1149.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1150.0s)]
*  And they would write letters to our house for years. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1151.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1153.0s)]
*  She was 19. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1154.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1155.0s)]
*  She wasn't a little kid. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1156.0s)]
*  Did you see the guy? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1157.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1158.0s)]

*  Yes. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1161.0s)]

*  Two feet. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1166.0s)]
*  And the guy was buried under the snow. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1167.0s)]
*  He goes, what the fuck? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1168.0s)]
*  He goes up there. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1169.0s)]
*  You save the guy's life randomly. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1170.0s)]
*  Is this separate? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1172.0s)]
*  Have you seen the footage where the guy's wearing the GoPro? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1173.0s)]
*  I've seen that. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1175.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1176.0s)]
*  And then he's like, falls into the ditch. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1177.0s)]
*  Into like a hole. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1178.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1179.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1180.0s)]

*  Oh my God. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1182.0s)]
*  And then he's just like, we'll see what happens. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1183.0s)]
*  Obviously he got out because there's footage. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1185.0s)]
*  When you're watching that, you're like, oh my God, you could just fall in there forever. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1188.0s)]
*  And apparently that's something that happens. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1191.0s)]
*  Tree wells? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1193.0s)]

*  No, I've had a couple of experiences like this. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1202.0s)]
*  He manages to stop himself. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1204.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1206.0s)]

*  They had to get Search and Rescue. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1218.0s)]
*  He had to hang out down there for a while. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1219.0s)]
*  Search and Rescue had to come up and- [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1221.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1222.0s)]

*  And do you see though? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1224.0s)]
*  He's so lucky that he stopped right there. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1225.0s)]
*  But the way, right here he's not flailing. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1227.0s)]
*  He's like putting his arm in his ski out to try to, like, so this guy was able to keep [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1229.0s)]
*  some composure as this was happening. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1234.0s)]
*  Which is like kind of the craziest part. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1236.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1238.0s)]
*  So this is the snowboarder that's buried upside down. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1239.0s)]
*  So this guy just sees that little blue piece. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1241.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1244.0s)]
*  Just randomly. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1245.0s)]
*  This happened to me. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1246.0s)]
*  He skied right over him. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1247.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean he easily could have missed that. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1248.0s)]
*  Could have gone the other way. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1250.0s)]
*  There's not much blue. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1251.0s)]
*  Soft snow, he's in a tree well is what it is. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1252.0s)]
*  So the tree wells, it's really soft, soft snow. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1254.0s)]
*  So if you get stuck in a tree well you are fucking dead. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1257.0s)]
*  A lot of people die in tree wells. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1260.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1261.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm thinking of getting one of those GPS things. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1262.0s)]
*  I want to get this one. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1264.0s)]
*  So we went snowboarding in Matterhorn, heliskiing. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1265.0s)]
*  And the guy put a beacon on us. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1269.0s)]
*  And the first thing he said, he puts a beacon, it's like four feet of powder. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1270.0s)]
*  And he says, this is so we can find the body. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1273.0s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1277.0s)]
*  He's like you might fall into a crevasse or an avalanche. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1279.0s)]
*  So we put the beacon on to find the body. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1282.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1285.0s)]
*  That feeling, this happened to me, that feeling is terrifying. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1286.0s)]
*  This guy's like, thank you. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1290.0s)]
*  Good, we'll get you out of here in a sec, okay? [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1292.0s)]
*  The panic, the panic. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1296.0s)]
*  He knew he was dead. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1297.0s)]
*  I'm feeling panic watching this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1298.0s)]
*  The panic, so what happens is, like what happened to me when we were heliskiing is I fell face forward in powder. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1299.0s)]
*  And I just, I never, snow skiing, snowboarding in powder, four feet of powder is very different than snowboarding. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1305.0s)]
*  It's like you have to have your bindings reset. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1311.0s)]
*  You have to really know how to ride the powder. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1313.0s)]
*  And I could not turn right. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1315.0s)]
*  And the guy told me, he's like, don't go within five feet of my tracks, stay within my tracks. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1317.0s)]
*  So the whole time, I can only turn left. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1322.0s)]
*  At the time, I really wasn't that good of a snowboarder. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1325.0s)]
*  But I could snowboard, but not in powder. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1327.0s)]
*  And so he's going like this, and all I can do is go left. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1330.0s)]
*  And I'm just going off the track. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1333.0s)]
*  And I'm fucking panicking. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1335.0s)]
*  Panicking. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1337.0s)]
*  But by the way, we're at like 13,000 feet, 14,000 feet. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1338.0s)]
*  It's very little oxygen. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1341.0s)]
*  I'm gassed, I'm fat, I'm hungover. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1343.0s)]
*  It's the day after the national championship that we went to. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1345.0s)]
*  So we had eaten edibles. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1347.0s)]
*  It was like. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1348.0s)]
*  It was the day after that? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1349.0s)]
*  It was the day after that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1350.0s)]
*  I flew to fucking, I flew to Switzerland and immediately landed and went heliskiing. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1351.0s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1356.0s)]
*  And so, no, no, no. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1357.0s)]
*  When we went to Florida State versus Alabama. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1358.0s)]
*  Oh, 2013. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1360.0s)]
*  Yeah, 2013. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1361.0s)]
*  So all of a sudden I go to cut right. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1362.0s)]
*  And I catch my nose and I fucking go face first in the snow. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1366.0s)]
*  And at first I'm like fine. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1371.0s)]
*  I push my arms in and they just do not touch anything. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1372.0s)]
*  It just goes like this. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1376.0s)]
*  And now snow's impacted on my face so I can't really breathe. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1377.0s)]
*  And I'm, first of all, I deal with panic. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1381.0s)]
*  But panic kicks in immediately. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1384.0s)]
*  And I'm like this is why I have the fucking beacon on. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1387.0s)]
*  And so I try to clear the snow out of my face. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1389.0s)]
*  But I'm like pulling all the muscles in my back trying to turn over. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1391.0s)]
*  And then the guy just comes up behind me, grabs me on the back, flips me over and he goes, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1395.0s)]
*  You should see your sound guy. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1399.0s)]
*  My sound guy's upside down, skis kicking upside down in the snow. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1401.0s)]
*  And we just got the fuck out. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1405.0s)]
*  We got on a helicopter and got the fuck out. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1406.0s)]
*  I was like, this isn't safe. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1408.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not interested in any of that nonsense. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1409.0s)]
*  Did I tell you about my last ski experience? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1412.0s)]
*  I only used to ski with my family. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1416.0s)]
*  This resonates every time I go skiing because you go, it's not worth it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1418.0s)]
*  He always says that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1422.0s)]
*  He always says it every time I go skiing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1423.0s)]
*  When I would go skiing because they wanted to go skiing and I would be like, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1425.0s)]
*  This is fun. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1429.0s)]
*  It's good for kids to learn early because they're really good at it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1430.0s)]
*  And my wife likes it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1433.0s)]
*  But I would be like, Don't get hurt. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1435.0s)]
*  Don't get hurt. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1437.0s)]
*  Don't get hurt. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1438.0s)]
*  Didn't get hurt. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1439.0s)]
*  Back up. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1440.0s)]
*  Don't get hurt. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1441.0s)]
*  Don't get hurt. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1442.0s)]
*  Didn't get hurt. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1443.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1444.0s)]
*  So all I'm doing is mitigating risk the entire time I'm skiing. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1445.0s)]
*  Because I've had fucking three knee operations. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1447.0s)]
*  I really know what it's like to blow your shit apart. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1449.0s)]
*  And they're like naive to how vulnerable your knees are. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1452.0s)]
*  And kids are fucking rubber. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1456.0s)]
*  They just fucking bounce off rocks and they're fine. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1458.0s)]
*  They fall down. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1461.0s)]
*  They only weigh 80 pounds. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1462.0s)]
*  They fall down. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1464.0s)]
*  They get right back up. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1465.0s)]
*  Right back up. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1466.0s)]
*  But so this last time I was going around this turn and this lady didn't know how to ski. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1467.0s)]
*  And it looked like she was just a fresh beginner. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1472.0s)]
*  And she was like doing the pizza thing. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1475.0s)]
*  But she was sliding right into the trail. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1477.0s)]
*  And it's a narrow trail. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1480.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I have two options. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1482.0s)]
*  I'm wiping this lady out or I'm going to catastrophically fall down. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1484.0s)]
*  I went with option two. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1488.0s)]
*  And I fucking tried to slide around this lady. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1490.0s)]
*  And my skis went up in the air. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1493.0s)]
*  And I banged the back of my head hard. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1495.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1497.0s)]
*  And I fractured my leg. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1498.0s)]
*  Helmet on? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1501.0s)]
*  It's called an insufficiency fracture. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1502.0s)]
*  It's a fracture at the top of the fibula or the tibia rather where the tibia touches the cartilage. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1504.0s)]
*  I had a fracture. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1512.0s)]
*  And I was 100% concussed. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1513.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1516.0s)]
*  Wait, helmet on? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1517.0s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1519.0s)]
*  Helmet? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1520.0s)]
*  Yeah, helmet on. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1521.0s)]
*  But it didn't matter. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1522.0s)]
*  It was hard snow head first. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1523.0s)]
*  Bam. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1525.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, wow, that was a big one. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1526.0s)]
*  I remember thinking that when I got hit. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1529.0s)]
*  I was like, that's a big one. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1531.0s)]
*  And I got on the ski lift afterwards. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1532.0s)]
*  And I just miscalculated. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1535.0s)]
*  Like, I wasn't coordinated. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1537.0s)]
*  And I fell down. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1538.0s)]
*  And I couldn't get up. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1540.0s)]
*  What? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1542.0s)]
*  Like, I couldn't get up without help. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1543.0s)]
*  The lady had to help me get up. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1545.0s)]
*  She had to reach out and grab my hand. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1547.0s)]
*  Because of the concussion. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1549.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1550.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1551.0s)]
*  So I'm just dizzy. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1552.0s)]
*  I'm off. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1555.0s)]
*  How long ago is this? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1556.0s)]
*  A couple years ago. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1557.0s)]
*  It was more than that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1559.0s)]
*  It was pre-pandemic. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1560.0s)]
*  Joe, I think about this every time I go fucking snowboarding. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1561.0s)]
*  I think it was three years ago. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1563.0s)]
*  No, I think it was three years ago. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1564.0s)]
*  After pandemic? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1565.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was during pandemic. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1566.0s)]
*  I think it was before. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1568.0s)]
*  People started skiing again. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1569.0s)]
*  It was definitely before. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1570.0s)]
*  I don't think so, man. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1571.0s)]
*  Joe, this story resonates. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1572.0s)]
*  Maybe four years. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1573.0s)]
*  That's the last time you went to ski. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1574.0s)]
*  At the most, it's four years old. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1575.0s)]
*  But I was like, that's just too... [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1577.0s)]
*  And then Shane Dorian tore his fucking knee apart. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1579.0s)]
*  World champion big wave surfer tears his knee apart snowboarding. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1582.0s)]
*  Just slammed into a tree and... [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1587.0s)]
*  That's why you gotta ski, folks. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1589.0s)]
*  Oh, hey, hang on. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1591.0s)]
*  Hang on. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1592.0s)]
*  You want to hear a story about old fuck face McGee? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1593.0s)]
*  I was skiing. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1594.0s)]
*  I was skiing. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1595.0s)]
*  You don't like snowboarding? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1596.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1597.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1598.0s)]
*  Let me share the story of skiing with Ari Shafir. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1599.0s)]
*  So first of all, Ari gets this app that tracks how fast you're going. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1601.0s)]
*  So the entire ski trip is based on how fast can you get... [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1604.0s)]
*  O'Neil had it. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1607.0s)]
*  And Ari's like, I think I got up to 70. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1608.0s)]
*  I bet I can break 75. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1610.0s)]
*  I bet I get 75. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1611.0s)]
*  Geez. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1612.0s)]
*  Sound barrier. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1613.0s)]
*  You're going 75 miles an hour on a skis? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1614.0s)]
*  I was trying to. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1616.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1617.0s)]
*  So we go, our last run in there's on... [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1618.0s)]
*  It's a blue. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1621.0s)]
*  Park City. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1622.0s)]
*  And Ari is absolutely reckless. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1623.0s)]
*  Off trail. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1625.0s)]
*  Well, because O'Neil's better than me. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1626.0s)]
*  I'm challenging. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1627.0s)]
*  I was like, let's race. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1628.0s)]
*  And I'm like, go. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1629.0s)]
*  And I just got the one second head start. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1630.0s)]
*  So we got Sean Patton, Mark Normand, O'Neil, Reneseezy. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1631.0s)]
*  Fat, gay, loser. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1635.0s)]
*  And we're all just... [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1636.0s)]
*  All we're doing is skiing to a bar. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1637.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1638.0s)]
*  We're all going to go get drunk and ski to a bar. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1639.0s)]
*  And I just hear Ari fucking basketball... [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1641.0s)]
*  He dresses like a fucking 13-year-old. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1643.0s)]
*  Basketball jersey. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1645.0s)]
*  Fucking... [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1646.0s)]
*  He's got the Viking horn helmet on. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1647.0s)]
*  Like a fucking lunatic. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1649.0s)]
*  This isn't... [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1651.0s)]
*  Is this... [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1652.0s)]
*  That's my mad... [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1653.0s)]
*  That's my mad jersey though. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1654.0s)]
*  And look, I got my sweatpants over the... [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1655.0s)]
*  And so Ari... [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1658.0s)]
*  I'm a damn fool. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1659.0s)]
*  Ari's at the top of the mountain. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1660.0s)]
*  He's like, let's see how fast we can go before we get to the bar. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1661.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm on a snowboard. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1663.0s)]
*  The fastest I'm getting is 37 miles per hour. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1664.0s)]
*  That's the fastest I'm going. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1666.0s)]
*  And I'm terrified because I hear you in my head going, it's not worth it. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1667.0s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1670.0s)]
*  Because you'd already stopped. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1671.0s)]
*  Ari decides to break the sound barrier, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1672.0s)]
*  pins his feet together, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1675.0s)]
*  and like a goddamn bullet starts fucking flying. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1677.0s)]
*  Literally, feet in front of the bar wipes out and breaks his wrist. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1681.0s)]
*  Some snowboarder turned back too fast. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1685.0s)]
*  He was making nice wide loops. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1687.0s)]
*  You broke your wrist through that? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1688.0s)]
*  And then he made a sharp one, flew, yeah, demolished it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1689.0s)]
*  He had to get it reconstructed. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1692.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a pin in there. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1693.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1694.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1695.0s)]
*  And all I heard was Joe Rogan, it's not worth it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1696.0s)]
*  We killed fast. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1700.0s)]
*  How fast were you going? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1701.0s)]
*  I was going pretty fast. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1702.0s)]
*  I was winning. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1703.0s)]
*  And then right behind me, he had stopped immediately. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1704.0s)]
*  You have to think about it this way. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1706.0s)]
*  For this momentary thrill of adrenaline and excitement, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1707.0s)]
*  you potentially risk a life of catastrophic injury. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1712.0s)]
*  That's every time I come on this podcast. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1718.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1722.0s)]
*  Look, I get it because life is finite. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1723.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1725.0s)]
*  You want to live and experience everything you want. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1726.0s)]
*  But I believe you should mitigate risk. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1728.0s)]
*  And I believe people are drawn to excitement. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1731.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, I mitigate risk. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1733.0s)]
*  The risk of skiing to me is like that one, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1738.0s)]
*  there's too many variables. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1741.0s)]
*  What do you think is the most dangerous activity you do? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1743.0s)]
*  Well, when I'm training, I'm not doing jujitsu right now, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1747.0s)]
*  but that's for sure the most dangerous. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1750.0s)]
*  Because of the potential damage. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1752.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're practicing strangling each other. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1753.0s)]
*  And you're doing it with people who are really good at strangling people. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1756.0s)]
*  I love skiing so much. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1759.0s)]
*  Grabbing your legs and yanking them apart. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1760.0s)]
*  This last trip was the last time. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1763.0s)]
*  How was it skiing as a less fat guy? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1765.0s)]
*  As a sober person. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1767.0s)]
*  As a less fat guy. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1768.0s)]
*  As a less fat guy. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1769.0s)]
*  It was fucking amazing. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1770.0s)]
*  I did a weird thing this year. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1772.0s)]
*  I didn't post any videos. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1774.0s)]
*  I didn't record anything. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1775.0s)]
*  I just hadn't lived. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1777.0s)]
*  I just lived. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1778.0s)]
*  My girls loved it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1779.0s)]
*  They were like, this is great. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1781.0s)]
*  We're not on Instagram for fucking people to see. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1782.0s)]
*  And I wasn't drinking. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1784.0s)]
*  And I was skinny. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1786.0s)]
*  And I said the only thing I recorded was I want to show you my favorite trick. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1788.0s)]
*  I could touch my foot. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1792.0s)]
*  I could never touch my foot snowboarding. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1793.0s)]
*  So getting my bindings on was so fucking tough. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1795.0s)]
*  It was so annoying. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1798.0s)]
*  My gut was in the way. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1799.0s)]
*  And it was so uncomfortable. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1801.0s)]
*  Dude, you were on stage Tuesday night. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1802.0s)]
*  And I was like, you're too jacked. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1805.0s)]
*  You're too jacked to take your shirt off now. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1806.0s)]
*  You look great. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1808.0s)]
*  It's not funny anymore. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1809.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1810.0s)]
*  I can't. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1811.0s)]
*  You know there are people that really believe that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1812.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1813.0s)]
*  There are people that really believe that. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=1814.0s)]

*  No, this is the best Joey Diaz story. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2091.64s)]
*  He goes, I call him up. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2094.64s)]
*  I'm having a panic attack. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2096.6s)]
*  I go, Joey, Ari just drugged me. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2098.52s)]
*  He's like, I'll be there in five, cocksucker. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2099.52s)]
*  Walks through the house. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2102.16s)]
*  He goes, Mrs. K, don't come out back. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2103.16s)]
*  Bad shit's happening out there. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2104.16s)]
*  Comes out and goes, what's going on, cocksuckers? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2105.16s)]
*  I go, Ari just drugged me. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2108.16s)]
*  He goes, let me see it. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2111.16s)]
*  Ari pulls out the other Molly. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2113.04s)]
*  Joey takes it, eats it and goes, we're all seeing the devil's dick tonight, cocksucker. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2114.24s)]
*  No one's dying on my watch. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2118.24s)]
*  If you die, I die. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2119.24s)]
*  We're all dying. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2120.24s)]
*  He's the fucking best. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2121.24s)]
*  We're all seeing the devil's dick tonight. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2122.24s)]
*  He's the fucking best. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2123.8799999999997s)]
*  We're all seeing the devil's dick tonight. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2124.8799999999997s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2127.8799999999997s)]
*  He's the funniest human being I've ever met. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2130.8799999999997s)]
*  I'll buy a house with Joey and a Harpy. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2131.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that's one of the ways to do it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2133.8799999999997s)]
*  I think... [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2136.12s)]
*  Get a comedy condo? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2137.12s)]
*  No, I'm legitimately thinking about that. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2138.12s)]
*  I've been thinking about that anyway because I've been thinking about doing a studio in [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2140.12s)]
*  downtown Austin with a view. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2143.6s)]
*  Because there's apartments that have a view. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2145.7999999999997s)]
*  Now, if you could do a studio in an apartment out there, you could have nighttime podcasts [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2147.9199999999996s)]
*  right after doing a comedy. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2152.52s)]
*  Drunk cast. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2153.52s)]
*  So you do a show at the comedy, just like we used to do at the Ice House. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2154.52s)]
*  So you do a show at the mothership and then go straight up to the condo, which is like [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2159.0s)]
*  three minutes away. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2163.32s)]
*  I'm going to... [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2164.32s)]
*  It makes sense, right? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2165.32s)]
*  I'm going to problem solve this. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2166.32s)]
*  After doing now, I think, seven sets in this couple days at your club, I think that's a [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2169.36s)]
*  horrible idea. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2175.16s)]
*  The amount of freedom that is at your club, the amount of free speech at your club is [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2176.16s)]
*  so dangerous. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2180.7599999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, I went up and I was like, wait, I didn't realize I can say anything I want. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2182.2000000000003s)]
*  You should have seen his face light up. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2186.0400000000004s)]
*  He's like, what are those bags on everybody's tables? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2187.36s)]
*  Oh. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2189.36s)]
*  Oh, you didn't know? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2190.36s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2191.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2192.36s)]
*  I was like, wow, Shane Gillis is really taking some chances. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2193.36s)]
*  He's screaming about how communism is good. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2195.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2198.36s)]
*  Pol Pot was a god. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2199.36s)]
*  And so I got up, I was hosting and then did an hour at the end of the show. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2201.36s)]
*  We did like three hours at the end of the show. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2205.48s)]
*  It's a long time together. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2206.96s)]
*  Wild shit. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2208.44s)]
*  But I didn't realize you can say whatever you want. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2209.44s)]
*  You really can just take chances. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2211.24s)]
*  So I felt like I wasn't doing my due diligence as a comic. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2212.72s)]
*  So I wrote the worst joke I could think of, like just insider joke. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2216.9199999999996s)]
*  Just like a, I was just, and it did well. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2221.08s)]
*  And I was like, fuck, this is crazy. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2224.3599999999997s)]
*  You want to take that energy up to that studio and do a podcast. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2227.16s)]
*  And then I get off your thing and I'm talking wild. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2229.7999999999997s)]
*  And then I go up to yours and I'm like, you know, what about Hitler? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2231.8799999999997s)]
*  Here's the deal. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2234.16s)]
*  His dad wasn't a bad guy. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2235.16s)]
*  It came from good people. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2236.16s)]
*  It came from good people. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2237.16s)]
*  He was a beekeeper. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2238.16s)]
*  You know that, Joe. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2239.16s)]
*  You interviewed a beekeeper? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2240.16s)]
*  I did interview a beekeeper. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2241.16s)]
*  I basically interviewed almost every walk of life, I think. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2244.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2248.2799999999997s)]
*  How many, how many episodes have you done now? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  2000. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2251.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2252.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  2093. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2254.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2255.2799999999997s)]
*  And then there's the fight companions, which is like a hundred and how many of those? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2256.2799999999997s)]
*  There's probably 60 to 70 of those in 153 MNM shows. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2259.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2263.6s)]
*  So that's another 200. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2264.6s)]
*  What's, what's your worst one? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2265.6s)]
*  I don't think I have a lot of bad ones. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2267.12s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2269.08s)]
*  I'd go around and nail our stinkers. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2272.0s)]
*  The early ones definitely, I sucked at it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2273.0s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2275.08s)]
*  That was, that was when it was wild. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2276.08s)]
*  It was wild. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2277.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2278.08s)]
*  But I mean, you just, but if you're having conversations with people, you're not good [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2279.08s)]
*  at like facilitating the conversation, especially if you're talking to a scientist and you're [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2282.08s)]
*  trying to get as much information into as many people's minds as possible. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2286.72s)]
*  So if there's any confusion about what they're saying, you have to know when to interrupt [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2292.3199999999997s)]
*  them or when to lay back. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2295.4s)]
*  When to, you got to bookmark like a thought. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2296.96s)]
*  Like I don't want to interrupt, but I got to bookmark this because I got to understand [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2300.6800000000003s)]
*  what do you mean exactly by that? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2303.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to saying that. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2304.6400000000003s)]
*  Wait, wait, that wasn't clear to me. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2305.6400000000003s)]
*  Can you say that? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2307.04s)]
*  Make that clear to me. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2308.04s)]
*  You can't pretend you understand something if you don't, you know, you have to, you have [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2309.04s)]
*  to just like, you're almost like a, like a cattle herder a little bit for the conversation. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2313.36s)]
*  You just kind of trying to keep the conversation. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2320.28s)]
*  You're trying to let it flow as much as possible, but you're also trying to like, you have to [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2323.08s)]
*  interact with it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2327.44s)]
*  Like, so you have to figure out like, what am I not absorbing about this? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2328.48s)]
*  Do you feel like there's somebody looking back that you understood the least? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2331.8s)]
*  In other words, you were like, fuck, I don't get what is going on no matter how hard I [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2335.16s)]
*  try. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2338.88s)]
*  Simulation theory is the big one because I had this conversation with what, what, what [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2339.88s)]
*  was that gentleman? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2345.76s)]
*  Remember we had a lot. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2346.76s)]
*  I was hoping it was a subject I'd understand. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2351.36s)]
*  It's like swimming. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2353.52s)]
*  It's about probability theory. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2355.9199999999996s)]
*  Probability theory? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2357.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2358.9199999999996s)]
*  So what his argument was, was like simulation theory. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2359.9199999999996s)]
*  Nick Bostrom. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2362.7599999999998s)]
*  That's it. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2363.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2364.7599999999998s)]
*  He's brilliant, brilliant guy. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  But when, when we're having this conversation, he was in, he was talking about simulation [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2367.44s)]
*  theory and saying that simulation theory, the idea that this whole thing we're experiencing [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2371.64s)]
*  is just a simulation because of probability theory, because of the probability of extraterrestrial [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2376.12s)]
*  civilizations, just given the amount of planets that are out there, the amount of [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2382.96s)]
*  time that has gone on, this is an inevitable thing that's going to happen. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2387.16s)]
*  And that it's probably already happened. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2392.56s)]
*  That it's probable that this is a simulation? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2394.04s)]
*  If it's not, it's going to happen and it probably already has. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2396.16s)]
*  The idea through- [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2400.48s)]
*  That we're in the first run of a billion runs is a big guess. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2401.48s)]
*  If you're a real expert, salute. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2403.8s)]
*  Let's finish it. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2405.36s)]
*  I know I'm butchering this, but the, I believe the concept in layman's terms is that given [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2407.0s)]
*  the sheer number of planets that probably have intelligent life and given the amount [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2413.48s)]
*  of time if they can develop technology to the point where we have and then further on [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2419.6400000000003s)]
*  to the point where you literally create some sort of a simulation that all time and all [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2424.8s)]
*  experiences exist in. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2430.92s)]
*  And that this was something that was possible through technology eventually. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2433.0s)]
*  And if you look at all these planets, you look at the direction that human beings are [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2437.96s)]
*  going, you look at how far our technology has progressed in a relatively short period [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2441.0s)]
*  of time. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2444.64s)]
*  It's inevitable. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2445.68s)]
*  Give it a thousand years, 10,000 years from now, if we don't blow the earth up, we will [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  have a simulation theory that's indiscernible from the reality you're experiencing right [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2452.2s)]
*  now. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2457.36s)]
*  That may be how life is experienced sometime in the future when we integrate with computers. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2458.36s)]
*  That might be like one step into that integration. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2465.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2468.2000000000003s)]
*  So yeah, having that conversation is like, what? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2469.2000000000003s)]
*  That also gives you, I think you might have a better perspective than people when you [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2473.08s)]
*  try to, when you really break down how brilliant some people are. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2479.32s)]
*  Like the scale. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2485.76s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2486.76s)]
*  We're all of like moderate intelligence and you go like, oh, you can understand these [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2488.1600000000003s)]
*  things like I can have this conversation with you. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2492.2400000000002s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2494.5200000000004s)]
*  And then, you know, you meet people who are notably not there. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2495.5200000000004s)]
*  And then people who are looking at you like, yeah, looking like an idiot. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2500.1600000000003s)]
*  Are you a child? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2503.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2504.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2505.96s)]
*  And you go, wow, those people are really operating on another wavelength, right? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2506.96s)]
*  Who simulates them? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2509.0800000000004s)]
*  It's just like athletes. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2510.0800000000004s)]
*  Athletic, I was about to say, it's like athletic ability. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2511.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2513.32s)]
*  Some people who you go, holy shit, you have a 40 inch vertical? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2514.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2516.7200000000003s)]
*  There's some people that are just, I mean, we've all met guys that don't even work out [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2518.68s)]
*  and they're just ridiculously strong. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2522.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2524.7999999999997s)]
*  They just have superior genetics. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2525.7999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2527.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of folks like that that are just country strong. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2528.7999999999997s)]
*  The guy that will do the tomahawk dunk in jeans and you're like, what the fuck? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2530.6s)]
*  It doesn't even work out. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2535.12s)]
*  You mean Cam Hayes' children run marathons in jeans? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2537.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2542.24s)]
*  They're different people. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2543.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2544.24s)]
*  And his other son's a ranger. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2545.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2547.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, different humans. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2548.7599999999998s)]
*  That D1 body where you're like, oh, this is different. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2551.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, Cam's dad was an athlete too. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2554.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2556.52s)]
*  Hardcore runner. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2557.52s)]
*  His book is amazing. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2558.52s)]
*  I think Cam's, wasn't he a jumper? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2559.52s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2562.6s)]
*  Cam's so modest too. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2563.6s)]
*  He was like a very high level athlete, his father was. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2565.04s)]
*  Cam's modest as shit about it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2568.4799999999996s)]
*  He's so modest too. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2569.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, he's like, how the fuck, he's like, well, you know, you just gotta get that run [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2570.4799999999996s)]
*  started. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2574.4399999999996s)]
*  You know what, man, that guy is always tired. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2575.4399999999996s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2576.64s)]
*  He runs. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2577.64s)]
*  But I mean, that's why he's like so chill. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2578.64s)]
*  He's conserving energy. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2580.92s)]
*  He knows this is a run 18 miles in the morning. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2581.92s)]
*  I bet he sleeps like a baby though. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2583.92s)]
*  I bet he sleeps like a brick. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2585.36s)]
*  I think he's Christian, so then he doesn't worry about death. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2587.48s)]
*  He just goes to heaven. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2590.28s)]
*  I get to go to heaven. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2591.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2592.28s)]
*  His shoes. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2593.28s)]
*  Have you run with his shoes? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2594.28s)]
*  Oh, we're going over here. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2595.28s)]
*  Those shoes are great. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2596.28s)]
*  I wanted to put a toast out or a post out today because they're that good. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2597.28s)]
*  Oh, they're excellent. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2600.6s)]
*  They look cool. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2601.6s)]
*  He has his own brand of shoes. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2602.6s)]
*  So Cam was sponsored for a long time by Under Armour and then he went for a second, tried [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2603.7599999999998s)]
*  out Salomon and then he said, fuck it, I'm just going to make mine. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2608.88s)]
*  I think it's his own clothing brand, but he's doing his very own shoe. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2611.36s)]
*  And when you get a motherfucker that can run like he does, who develops technology and [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2614.48s)]
*  the shit that makes him comfortable, this shoe is amazing. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2618.68s)]
*  These boa laces keep your heel in place. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2621.24s)]
*  Blood splattered on it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2624.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2625.6s)]
*  That's blood. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2626.6s)]
*  That's blood. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2627.6s)]
*  You can say it's mud, but it's red. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2628.6s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2630.2s)]
*  You know what that is. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2631.2s)]
*  I love that Tom's pouring a drink. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2632.2s)]
*  They're dope sneakers and they're super comfortable. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2633.7999999999997s)]
*  They're amazing. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2636.6s)]
*  Tom's a scouts guy. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2637.6s)]
*  So the thing about plantar fasciitis that a lot of people have is your foot moves around [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2638.6s)]
*  in your shoe. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2643.04s)]
*  Laces do that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2644.48s)]
*  But with Cam's shoe, those boa things lock your heel in. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2645.48s)]
*  And I've been running every single day, no plantar fasciitis, and they're very fucking [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2648.48s)]
*  comfortable. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2652.72s)]
*  Yeah, they're great. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2653.72s)]
*  You know, I think plantar fasciitis probably is a lot about foot strength and foot endurance, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2654.72s)]
*  isn't it? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2658.72s)]
*  I used to have it. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2659.72s)]
*  I think so. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2660.72s)]
*  Like you just go too far. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2661.72s)]
*  But also the PT's will tell you that a lot of that originates from your big toes movement [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2663.24s)]
*  though. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2668.64s)]
*  Really? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2669.64s)]
*  If you start to, because you can feel plantar fasciitis starting a lot of times. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2670.64s)]
*  You're like, oh, this is starting to get uncomfortable. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2673.9199999999996s)]
*  It's not full blown. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2676.08s)]
*  In the mornings. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2677.08s)]
*  And they'll tell you to train your big toe to work on strength with your big toe. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2678.08s)]
*  People move to New York at it because you're walking constantly. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2682.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2685.52s)]
*  You guys walk so much more. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2686.52s)]
*  And then it's just like, what the fuck's in my heel? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2687.52s)]
*  Do you remember when you told me to get Rolfed for my plantar fasciitis? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2689.16s)]
*  What is that? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2692.68s)]
*  When you suck come out of a dude's asshole? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2693.68s)]
*  Hey! [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2694.68s)]
*  No, that's naked Martin. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2695.68s)]

*  This is felching. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2700.16s)]
*  The whole world's going to listen to this show. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2701.16s)]
*  Do you know how many fucking people are going to book a video with that guy right now? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2702.56s)]
*  Oh, so many. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2707.3599999999997s)]
*  He's rich right now. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2708.3599999999997s)]
*  I hope they don't get in front of our order. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2709.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, they are. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2710.3599999999997s)]
*  That guy's going to be rich. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2711.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, in a perfect world he would be rich. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2712.3599999999997s)]
*  Because that's an oddity. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2713.9199999999996s)]
*  Like if you're going to go that far, you deserve something. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2714.9199999999996s)]
*  You deserve money. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2717.6s)]
*  That's the only fans I'm saying. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2718.6s)]
*  That guy ate his own shit covered in cum. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2720.48s)]
*  And we watched. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2722.04s)]
*  He didn't even pause. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2723.04s)]
*  And he smiled. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2724.04s)]
*  He smiled and I, who hosted Fear Factor for six years, I almost threw up. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2725.04s)]
*  From watching that screen. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2729.76s)]
*  We're so excited for you to get your present. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2730.76s)]
*  What's the present? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2732.96s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2735.96s)]
*  You'll see. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2736.96s)]
*  It'll be in the group thread. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2737.96s)]
*  Can't wait. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2740.96s)]
*  That feeling of the... [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2743.96s)]
*  That's such a horrible feeling. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2746.36s)]
*  It was like... [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2747.36s)]
*  You don't have a throw up thing. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2748.88s)]
*  Oh, I do. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2750.88s)]
*  For real? [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2751.88s)]
*  He holds it. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2752.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2753.88s)]
*  Here's what's fascinating. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2754.88s)]
*  I lost it when I was filming Fear Factor. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2755.88s)]
*  Nothing can make me puke. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2757.88s)]
*  Desensitized. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2760.88s)]
*  Completely desensitized. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2761.88s)]
*  Before, I was the kid in high school that if you threw up in the hallway, I would throw [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2762.88s)]
*  up. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2766.36s)]
*  I do. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2767.36s)]
*  You'd smile and throw up. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2768.36s)]
*  That's a YMH wretch. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2769.36s)]
*  That's a YMH wretch. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2770.36s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2771.36s)]
*  I think that's evolutionary. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2776.36s)]
*  I think that when you smell throw up, no, no, no. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2778.6s)]
*  It's letting you know that someone around you has consumed something that's bad and [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2782.84s)]
*  that you should purge too. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2788.76s)]
*  It's like a survival instinct. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2792.32s)]
*  It's protecting you. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2793.32s)]
*  It's a protective instinct. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2794.32s)]
*  It's not a weakness to want to throw up when you smell throw up. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2795.32s)]
*  It's actually a strength. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2798.4s)]
*  So what happens when people cry and I cry too? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2799.4s)]
*  That's good too because you're commiserating. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2801.88s)]
*  I cry so much. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2802.88s)]
*  You're showing you're a good person. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2803.88s)]
*  I cry so much. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2804.88s)]
*  You're a sweetheart. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2806.4s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2807.4s)]
*  Because you switch to weed more. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2808.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2809.4s)]
*  Well, weed is really beautiful. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2810.4s)]
*  Weed will get you crying. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2811.4s)]
*  It allows you to appreciate. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2812.4s)]
*  You're an emotional guy though. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2813.4s)]
*  You had grown tits. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2814.4s)]
*  I cried the other day on our podcast. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2815.4s)]
*  You did? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2817.2400000000002s)]
*  He's grown tits. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2818.2400000000002s)]
*  Nobody cries more on podcasts than Bert. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2819.2400000000002s)]
*  Not me anymore. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2820.2400000000002s)]
*  He cries a lot. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2821.2400000000002s)]
*  I cry a lot. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  I regret a couple cries. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2823.2400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  Schultz's. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2825.2400000000002s)]
*  I regret that one. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  You cried on Schultz's podcast? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2827.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2828.2400000000002s)]
*  What did you cry about? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  Fucking nothing. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2830.2400000000002s)]
*  Bambi? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2831.2400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2832.2400000000002s)]

*  Marketing? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2836.6s)]
*  No, he brought out a clown and some balloons and it fucking fucked me up. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2837.6s)]
*  A clown and balloons made you cry. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2840.7999999999997s)]

*  One of few people who have seen even a rough cut of the film, comedian and voiceover artist [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2937.12s)]
*  Harry Shearer of The Simpsons told Spy Magazine in 1992 that the movie is so drastically wrong. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2940.7999999999997s)]
*  Its pathos and its comedy are so wildly misplaced that you could not in your fantasy of what [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2947.68s)]
*  it might be like and prove on what it really is. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2954.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2958.08s)]
*  That's all you can say. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2960.2s)]
*  This movie was so bad. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2962.02s)]
*  I want to see it so bad now. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2963.02s)]
*  They buried it forever. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2964.02s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2965.02s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2966.02s)]
*  They buried it forever. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2967.02s)]
*  And when did this movie get released? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2968.02s)]
*  72. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2969.02s)]
*  So this is a movie from 1972 that was so bad. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2970.02s)]
*  That never saw the light of day. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2973.68s)]
*  They put it in a vault in the bottom of the earth. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2974.68s)]
*  I'd pay to buy it. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2977.48s)]
*  I want to see it so bad. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2978.48s)]
*  Even if it's bad, I want to see it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2979.48s)]
*  I want to see it more than I want to listen to that Wu-Tang album. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2983.16s)]
*  How did Harry Shearer see it? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2985.64s)]
*  That Martin Scurilli. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2986.64s)]
*  I was thinking about that the other day. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2987.64s)]
*  Big Jay has it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2988.64s)]
*  Big Jay has it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2989.64s)]
*  What? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2990.64s)]
*  Big Jay has it. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2991.64s)]
*  He went on Legion of Skanks. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2992.64s)]
*  It's one of the most frustrating episodes to listen to because it's Legion of Skanks [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2993.64s)]
*  and you have Martin Scurilli and Shane Gillis is grilling him. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=2998.44s)]
*  But you got Legion of Skanks being Legion of Skanks. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3002.2400000000002s)]
*  They don't really care about the information. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3004.68s)]
*  They just want to fucking talk about whatever. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3006.44s)]
*  Calm. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3008.36s)]
*  Yeah, calm and everything. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3009.36s)]
*  But Martin Scurilli said, I have the album you want it? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3010.36s)]
*  And all of them are like, fuck yes. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3012.64s)]
*  So how do you give it to them? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3014.44s)]
*  Jay's got the one with the vinyl player. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3016.0s)]
*  It's the same way you got your thing. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3017.0s)]
*  They end it to them. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3018.0s)]
*  In what form? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3019.0s)]
*  Just sent them an mp3. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3020.0s)]
*  It's vinyl. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3021.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3022.0s)]
*  What? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3023.0s)]
*  So then it's out on the internet now? [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3024.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3025.0s)]
*  Legion of Skanks. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3026.0s)]
*  No one ever shared it. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3027.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3028.0s)]
*  So what's Martin doing with it? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3029.0s)]
*  He bought it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3030.0s)]
*  I got to send everyone to the episode. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3031.0s)]
*  It's one of the most fascinating episodes I've ever listened to. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3032.32s)]
*  Have you listened to it? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3034.64s)]
*  I don't have it. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3035.8399999999997s)]
*  They have it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3036.8399999999997s)]
*  He had some good information where he was like, you know, he was like, got the thing [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3037.8399999999997s)]

*  It's so interesting. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3040.48s)]
*  And he goes, he's jacking the price. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3041.48s)]
*  He goes, you know what no one ever said? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3042.48s)]
*  There's also a generic version of the same drug. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3043.7599999999998s)]
*  For $40. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3045.44s)]
*  For $40. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3046.44s)]

*  Yes. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3052.44s)]
*  What does the generic version mean? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3053.44s)]
*  It's like Viagra versus whatever the fuck. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3054.44s)]
*  But wait, you can hear it? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3055.6s)]

*  Yeah, you care more about Wu Tang. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3060.88s)]
*  No, he doesn't care about it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3061.88s)]
*  Generic version. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3062.88s)]
*  I was like, what does that mean? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3063.88s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3064.88s)]
*  It's not finished? [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3065.88s)]
*  I was so myself so confused about generic drugs. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3066.88s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3069.88s)]
*  My brain just went to like, wait, is it without RZA? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3070.88s)]
*  This is a real conversation. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3074.88s)]
*  But this is a real conversation because with AI, they're going to do that. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3076.88s)]
*  They're going to make new versions of Wu Tang songs. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3079.88s)]
*  They already did it with Drake. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3082.44s)]
*  I think that the thing too is, you know how they go, oh, likeness and write like the stars, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3083.96s)]
*  I want to, this movie is without Tom Cruise will be like, no, you cannot use my likeness. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3090.04s)]
*  I am protecting it. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3095.84s)]
*  That's like what some of this labor union stuff is about, protecting your image and [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3096.84s)]
*  likeness. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3101.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3102.28s)]

*  Yes. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3115.96s)]
*  He's not doing well. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3116.96s)]
*  I forget what it's called. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3117.96s)]

*  Of course. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3123.52s)]
*  We're just here talking about. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3124.52s)]
*  I can't look at a post and not think about me. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3125.52s)]
*  He's, so Bruce Willis sold his likeness. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3127.96s)]
*  So you can likeness, sorry, for the purpose of AI. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3134.92s)]
*  He did? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3139.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3140.92s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3141.92s)]
*  All I can say is thank you. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3142.92s)]
*  But in his position, I mean, he's incapable of making money anymore. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3145.12s)]
*  He can't work. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3149.32s)]
*  He has a real issue. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3150.32s)]
*  It's actually very advanced and they think this is towards, we're at the close to the [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3151.32s)]
*  end. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3154.48s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3155.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3156.48s)]
*  I follow his daughter to Lula. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3157.48s)]
*  So, no, Bruce Willis didn't sell his likeness to a deep fake company. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3158.48s)]
*  Despite initial reports, the deep fake company does not own the rights to Bruce Willis's [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3162.88s)]
*  likeness. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3168.12s)]
*  Partially because that's literally not possible, the company said. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3170.04s)]
*  Bruce Willis appeared in a recent advertisement through Deep Cake, which managed to create [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3172.84s)]
*  a digital twin of Willis that can appear in new content despite the actual Willis retiring [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3178.1200000000003s)]
*  from acting as a result of aphasia, a brain disorder that hinders cognition and speech [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3183.28s)]
*  abilities. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3187.8s)]
*  I like the precision of my character, Willis said of the process according to the quote [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3188.8s)]
*  in Deep Cake website. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3192.92s)]
*  It's a great opportunity for me to go back in time. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3194.7200000000003s)]
*  The neural network was trained on content of Die Hard and Fifth Element, so my character [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3198.28s)]
*  is similar to the images of that time. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3203.7200000000003s)]
*  So it's young Bruce Willis doing ads. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3207.84s)]
*  I sent you guys. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3211.0400000000004s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3217.0400000000004s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3218.0400000000004s)]

*  That seems like that is what we're saying. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3220.0400000000004s)]
*  It feels like this is, and also this is literal phase one of the A-list celebrity being like [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3223.8s)]
*  you can use it for this. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3231.76s)]

*  she might say, you know what? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3237.1200000000003s)]
*  For $200 million, go for it. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3239.04s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3242.04s)]
*  And also what about the people who, it's not a major movie making it, it's just some YouTube [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3243.04s)]
*  account. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3245.6400000000003s)]

*  What happens to dead people? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3247.6400000000003s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3257.48s)]
*  This is the George Carlin one that came out a couple weeks ago. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3258.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3259.48s)]
*  How many views? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3260.48s)]
*  It says- [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3261.48s)]
*  Change the cover. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3262.48s)]
*  It's under 500k. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3263.48s)]
*  It keeps getting pulled down. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3264.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3265.48s)]
*  It keeps getting pulled down. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3266.48s)]
*  Yeah, because George Carlin's daughter Kelly, I think, doesn't want it up. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3267.48s)]
*  I disagree with that. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3273.0s)]
*  It's put on a YouTube account called Dudezy. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3274.96s)]
*  Dudezy says I'm a comedy AI. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3278.72s)]
*  They wrote this as though Dudezy made it, if you will. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3281.88s)]
*  When you look at what Dudezy is, Dudezy's a- [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3284.4s)]
*  Oh, it's Will Sasso. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3286.6800000000003s)]
*  It's Will Sasso. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3288.28s)]
*  But they have an AI. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3289.48s)]
*  That's where it becomes like how would Will Sasso have this super secret AI program? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3290.48s)]
*  Hold on, Will Sasso has a podcast, if I'm not mistaken, where he has AI bring up the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3297.6800000000003s)]
*  subjects of the podcast and that's what they talk about, theoretically thinking this will, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3303.76s)]
*  based on research, be one of the best podcasts out there. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3308.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, there's a podcast on it. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3311.2799999999997s)]
*  Look, click on that. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3312.64s)]
*  It says George Carlin resurrected- [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3313.64s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3315.16s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3316.16s)]
*  When I was looking into what is this George Carlin thing, it's on this account that they [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3317.16s)]
*  call Dudezy and they're saying Dudezy made this. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3321.68s)]
*  Oh, so they made it through AI. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3324.2s)]
*  It's most likely like that Kanye song we played with Tony where someone wrote in how George [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3326.3999999999996s)]
*  Carlin would write and then performed it all and then got George Carlin's voice to go over [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3332.12s)]
*  top of that to replace it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3337.04s)]
*  Well, it's like a version of his voice. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3338.04s)]
*  No. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3339.04s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3340.04s)]
*  No, I heard AI wrote the jokes. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3341.84s)]
*  That's tough. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3344.68s)]
*  That's where it becomes very tough. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3345.68s)]
*  You're saying that AI didn't write the jokes? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3346.68s)]
*  In this case, I don't know, but it seems a lot more like the fake thing like the Drake [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3349.4s)]
*  song and the Kanye song where it's not 100% done by AI. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3353.0s)]
*  What you're hearing is like an AI doing a deep fake video like- [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3356.36s)]
*  And who would write it? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3360.32s)]
*  In that case, it was the rapper who wrote the rap song. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3361.32s)]
*  In this case, it's probably comedians who know how to write like George Carlin. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3364.52s)]
*  On Skanks this week, they played AI versions of their standups to the Soder, Jay, Louis, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3366.92s)]
*  Dave, and one other guy, I forget. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3373.8s)]
*  And they were like, here's your AI version of your standup. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3377.88s)]
*  And they just played it for him and they all broke it down. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3379.7200000000003s)]
*  How was it? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3381.88s)]
*  They said it was a lot of fun. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3382.88s)]
*  It's hard to be worse. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3384.4s)]
*  Yeah, butterly. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3385.4s)]
*  Hopefully, it's not amazing. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3386.4s)]
*  You're the only one that got the joke. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3387.4s)]
*  Louis is like, can I use that? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3388.4s)]
*  I feel like we're joking around about the first rain shower that comes before the torrential [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3389.88s)]
*  flood that caused Noah to build a fucking ark. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3403.56s)]
*  You're right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3406.36s)]
*  I think it's going to get bad. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3407.36s)]
*  I think it's scary. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3408.36s)]
*  It's going to be a new world. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3409.36s)]
*  The world is going to be built in a very hazy way. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3411.44s)]
*  All this stuff about AI, I understand why the Riders Guild was really concerned about [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3415.6s)]
*  this. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3423.72s)]
*  And they're concerned by version one, dude. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3424.72s)]
*  This just started. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3428.7599999999998s)]
*  Imagine the first fucking iPhone. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3429.7599999999998s)]
*  Also, it's going to get rid of a lot of shitty riders. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3431.7599999999998s)]
*  That's true. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3436.0s)]
*  Can you stop stealing Copenhagen TV shows and fucking make something? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3437.0s)]
*  All those people who keep making the same cop show over and over again, get the fuck [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3440.92s)]
*  out. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3445.2000000000003s)]
*  Do we miss her, Mrs. Smith? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3446.2000000000003s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3447.2000000000003s)]
*  It'll replace a lot of low-level basic shit. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3448.2000000000003s)]
*  And you'll lose a lot of great ones. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3452.32s)]
*  You still need your Christopher Nolan to write his stuff. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3453.32s)]
*  Yeah, but Christopher Nolan had to be a shitty writer first. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3455.32s)]
*  100%. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3457.04s)]
*  You got to be a shitty writer first to become Christopher Nolan. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3458.04s)]
*  Yeah, unless you're some wizard that comes out of the womb. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3460.32s)]
*  Charles Goffin, Charlie Carlin. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3463.32s)]
*  But that's very rare. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3464.32s)]
*  Very rare. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3465.32s)]
*  The only thing I think that would be beneficial is be great. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3466.32s)]
*  If I could do my podcast with AI and then type in, yo, can you take all the annoying [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3469.0s)]
*  parts of me out of there? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3474.12s)]
*  When I talk over you, I would love to laugh. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3476.2s)]
*  How much is not talk over people? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3478.68s)]
*  You don't need a fucking robot. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3480.6s)]
*  It's kind of fucking tough. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3482.32s)]
*  You don't need a robot to do it for you. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3483.32s)]
*  Finally, I told you. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3484.92s)]
*  So, Burt has this thing where anybody, anybody with any level of celebrity, he fucking geeks [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3485.92s)]
*  out so hard on you. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3494.48s)]
*  It's so embarrassing. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3495.88s)]
*  Like a TikTok person. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3496.88s)]
*  He's like, I'm the biggest fan. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3498.76s)]
*  Oh my God, I saw the video. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3499.76s)]

*  I saw the thing. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3502.76s)]
*  And then he goes, and then he waits to tell them about him. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3503.76s)]
*  He tells them his resume. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3506.76s)]
*  Do you have imposter syndrome? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3508.76s)]
*  Of course. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3510.76s)]
*  If you don't, I am curious why. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3511.76s)]
*  I didn't say I don't. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3513.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3514.36s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3515.36s)]
*  Why is this so aggressive? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3516.36s)]
*  My answer is fairly calm. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3517.36s)]
*  Imposter syndrome is kind of- [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3521.4s)]
*  I was just trying to find out what he was feeling. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3522.4s)]
*  Imposter syndrome has been loaded as like a slur. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3524.12s)]
*  I don't think it's a slur at all. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3528.3199999999997s)]
*  I have it. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3529.4s)]

*  I think imposter syndrome is a sign of an introspective person who's trying to navigate [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3534.4s)]
*  a very bizarre situation. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3540.08s)]
*  I think it's completely 100% natural and normal. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3542.12s)]

*  He told me secrets about writing. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3776.56s)]
*  You just embrace this aspect of yourself. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3779.56s)]
*  It seems, you don't like it. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3782.56s)]
*  It makes you angry when it comes out. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3784.56s)]
*  You get upset at yourself. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3787.56s)]
*  But yet you also embrace it. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3788.56s)]
*  It's so gross though. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3790.56s)]
*  It's so gross. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3792.56s)]
*  It's like you're playing, you're playing tic-tac-toe against yourself in your own head. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3793.56s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3797.56s)]
*  But here's the thing, I wanted to confess to you because you go, you told me that you [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3798.56s)]
*  admire the way that I am around celebrities, right? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3802.56s)]

*  You're the guy in an orgy. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3807.56s)]
*  You're the guy in the porn who's jerking off before he fucks her. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3808.56s)]
*  I'm the guy in the porn going, I got three minutes to interview. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3811.56s)]
*  That might be the worst analogy literally ever. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3813.56s)]
*  That one makes no sense. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3816.56s)]
*  No one listened to that. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3818.56s)]
*  It was like, yeah, I get it. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3819.56s)]
*  Relatable. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3821.56s)]
*  Good call. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3822.56s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3823.56s)]
*  What I told him was the truth, which was that I would say 90% of the time when I meet a [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3825.56s)]
*  famous person, I don't care that I'm meeting them. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3832.56s)]
*  In other words, I'm just like, yeah, all right, what's up? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3835.56s)]
*  How you doing? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3837.56s)]
*  So it looks like I'm being cool or aloof, but I just don't give a shit. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3838.56s)]
*  He really genuinely does not care. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3841.56s)]
*  I just don't care. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3843.56s)]
*  He really does not. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3844.56s)]
*  Right, because if you go like, hey, this is the guy from the show. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3845.56s)]
*  I'm like, what's up, man? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3847.56s)]
*  Anytime I've ever met a famous person, I text Tommy immediately and go, guess who I just [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3848.56s)]
*  met? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3851.56s)]
*  I sent him a picture. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3852.56s)]
*  And then Tommy has hung out legit as friends with Brad Pitt and Jason Momoa and didn't [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3853.56s)]
*  fucking tell me. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3859.56s)]
*  And then I go, why wouldn't you tell me this immediately? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3860.56s)]
*  And he goes, I don't know. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3862.56s)]
*  I didn't think about it. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3863.56s)]
*  It just didn't really. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3864.56s)]
*  But then he goes, what would it take? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3866.56s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3867.56s)]
*  And then I text you last night. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3868.56s)]
*  I go, I guess it's Snoop Dogg because I fucking went into his, we were on Kimmel and I went [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3869.56s)]
*  into his dressing room and I was like, I'm going, I guess I'm going Bert. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3874.56s)]
*  I did my version of Bert. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3877.56s)]
*  Wow. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3878.56s)]
*  I was like, I was like, it's so admirable that your career has lasted. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3879.56s)]
*  You didn't. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3883.56s)]
*  You didn't. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3887.56s)]
*  Oh, that was fucking great. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3888.56s)]
*  Snoop's a tough one. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3890.56s)]
*  He's so nice. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3891.56s)]
*  He's so nice. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3892.56s)]
*  He's so nice. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3893.56s)]
*  All I did was I was like, I couldn't believe I'm on with him. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3894.56s)]
*  First he told me, he's like, good to see you again. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3897.56s)]
*  I was like, we've never met. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3899.56s)]
*  He thought you were me. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3900.56s)]
*  And then I went back into his dressing room and I was just like, it was great to be on [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3901.56s)]
*  the show with you. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3905.56s)]
*  And I had to tell him, I was like, you know, it's just crazy to me that I bought your album. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3906.56s)]
*  I bought it in 93. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3911.56s)]
*  The year before in 92 was a deep cover. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3913.56s)]
*  I bought that. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3917.56s)]
*  And you're still like, you're still Snoop. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3918.56s)]
*  It's fucking, it's crazy. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3921.56s)]
*  It's 30 fucking whatever years. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3922.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's got the best longevity. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3924.56s)]
*  And so I go, I just, I just admire that like so much. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3926.56s)]
*  And then he like, he said, you know, he says everything cool. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3929.56s)]
*  Wait, try to guess, try to guess. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3932.56s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3934.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3935.56s)]
*  He knows what this is going on. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3936.56s)]
*  He goes, let me get a flick with you. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3938.56s)]
*  And I go, oh, that means picture. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3940.56s)]
*  Like, let me get a flick with you. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3943.56s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3945.56s)]
*  So he asked for the photo. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3947.56s)]
*  And then I was like, yeah, this is, I mean, he goes, yeah, I want to be in the picture. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3949.56s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not in any movie. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3951.56s)]
*  You were in a very big movie with Mark Wahlberg. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3956.56s)]
*  Bro, do you know how high he is all day long? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3958.56s)]
*  Do you know how high he was there? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3960.56s)]
*  Snoop lives in an alternative dimension. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3962.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3964.56s)]
*  It's not where we are. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3965.56s)]
*  It's very cool to be, cause I know he's been on the podcast, but like to be around someone and be around other people who you're like, dude, everyone, every age group, every generation. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3967.56s)]
*  Loves him. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3977.56s)]
*  Everybody just loves him. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3978.56s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3979.56s)]
*  It's fun to be around. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3980.56s)]
*  The only time I saw him serious is on this podcast when he was talking about how he had to switch to backwoods rolling papers. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3981.56s)]
*  And he was like, the young kids are telling me and I really had to make a change. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3989.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3992.56s)]
*  Road blunts the entire time. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3993.56s)]
*  Wasn't that like crazy to be on the show? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3997.56s)]
*  I lived with Snoop for a month. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=3999.56s)]
*  We lived in a hotel together. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4001.56s)]
*  We were across the hall and I worked with him every day. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4003.56s)]
*  But I have to say, and you know this. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4005.56s)]
*  I was really nervous about meeting Snoop, cause I can overwhelm people sometimes. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4008.56s)]
*  Like I'll just, I have a large wake. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4012.56s)]
*  That's self awareness. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4014.56s)]
*  That's advanced. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4015.56s)]
*  That's advanced. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4016.56s)]
*  Right? [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4017.56s)]
*  I'm trying. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4018.56s)]
*  But I said to Tommy, can you tell me how to meet Snoop? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4019.56s)]
*  Cause like, I know how you do it. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4022.56s)]
*  You do it cool. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4024.56s)]
*  Tell me how to do it cool cause I want to be friends with him. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4025.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4027.56s)]
*  And you said, and you said, I like you. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4028.56s)]
*  Snoop will like you. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4033.56s)]
*  Be yourself. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4034.56s)]
*  So I was myself and of course I fucking lost my goddamn shit and Snoop stopped. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4035.56s)]
*  Snoop stopped. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4040.56s)]
*  And real quick, like in the middle of me being me, he just FaceTimes Red Grant and he goes, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4041.56s)]
*  Hey, you know this guy? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4047.56s)]
*  And he flips it around and I go, and Red goes, he's cool. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4049.56s)]
*  And he goes, all right, cool. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4052.56s)]
*  And he's like, you're cool. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4053.56s)]
*  It is me and Snoop FaceTime with Dave Chappelle and Donnell Rollins. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4054.56s)]
*  But that was the night we got high and fucking Snoop's the best man. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4057.56s)]
*  So you got him to the point where it was like, maybe I don't want to be in this conversation. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4063.56s)]
*  He had to check my credibility. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4067.56s)]
*  He checked him. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4069.56s)]
*  He had to check my credibility. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4070.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4071.56s)]
*  We were talking about Cat Williams and I was talking about Pimp Chronicles. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4072.56s)]
*  And then I was, and then it's embarrassing. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4077.56s)]
*  It's embarrassing. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4081.56s)]
*  But I knew that Snoop knew Red and I knew that if I brought up Red, Snoop would think maybe, okay, he might know people I know. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4083.56s)]
*  That was smart. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4090.56s)]
*  But then immediately Snoop called me on my shit. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4091.56s)]
*  And in the middle of my story, just FaceTime Red. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4093.56s)]
*  You know him? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4095.56s)]
*  And then Red's like, yeah, he's great. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4096.5599999999995s)]
*  I love Bird. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4098.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but haven't you ever had conversations with people you know you don't know them and they pretend they know you? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4099.5599999999995s)]
*  All the time. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4103.5599999999995s)]
*  And they also bring up people that supposedly they know that you know. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  References you know you're not going to check. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4107.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you know Chris, man. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4108.5599999999995s)]

*  Rochester? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4113.5599999999995s)]
*  And he was like, he goes, we met before. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4114.5599999999995s)]
*  We met before with Mark Wahlberg. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4116.5599999999995s)]
*  I go, oh, cool. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4118.5599999999995s)]

*  Oh, you're crazy. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4126.56s)]
*  You're a crazy, crazy liar person. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4127.56s)]
*  A lot of people say you bring your name up. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4129.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wild one. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4131.56s)]

*  Yeah, I'm friends with Joe. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4133.56s)]
*  This is a guy I met. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4134.56s)]
*  And I do it too. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4136.56s)]
*  His dentist told me. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4137.56s)]
*  His dentist told him he played golf with me. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4138.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4141.56s)]
*  Joe the golfer. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4142.56s)]
*  Oh, you're Joe the golfer? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4143.56s)]
*  This guy's like, my dentist plays golf with you. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4144.56s)]
*  Guy does fucking three rounds every day. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4145.56s)]
*  Your dentist is crazy. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4147.56s)]
*  Don't let him operate on you, bro. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4148.56s)]
*  He puts you under his dick. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4150.56s)]
*  I think the weirdest thing about the Joe connection is people being like, can you give this to [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4152.56s)]
*  Joe? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4158.56s)]
*  Oh, I get that all the time. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4159.56s)]
*  That's the thing I get the most where I'm like, huh? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4160.56s)]
*  And they're like, I wrote this. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4161.56s)]
*  Can you give this to him? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4163.56s)]
*  What is it, another manifesto? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4164.56s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4165.56s)]
*  I'll definitely. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4166.56s)]
*  If the type is really little, they write really small and get scared. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4167.56s)]
*  Or you get, the scariest is a. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4171.56s)]
*  Tiny letters. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4173.56s)]
*  Like, no. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4174.56s)]
*  If they try to like two sentences in one line, you know, like one on top of each other, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4175.56s)]
*  I'll be fucking terrified. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4181.56s)]
*  You ever seen writing on writing? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4182.56s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4183.56s)]
*  That's schizophrenic. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4184.56s)]
*  Schizophrenic. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4185.56s)]
*  Tell, tell schizophrenia. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4186.56s)]
*  Writing on top of writing. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4187.56s)]
*  What do you mean on top of writing? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4188.56s)]
*  So like you write something and then write right on top of it. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4189.56s)]
*  So like it's, it's, it's, you can't read it. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4191.56s)]
*  It's alien. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4194.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4195.56s)]
*  And then they'll be like, check this out. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4196.56s)]
*  And so you immediately, you're just like, oh yeah, no, this is good. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4197.56s)]
*  I'll give this to him. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4200.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4201.56s)]
*  This is really good. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4202.56s)]
*  Just choose people. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4203.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4204.56s)]
*  There's some people that for whatever reason, whatever fucking happens, whether it's chemical [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4205.56s)]
*  or neurons, whatever it is that makes that shift, they're seeing things completely different [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4208.92s)]
*  than you. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4214.76s)]

*  By the way, gentlemen, you all look very sharp. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4216.76s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4217.76s)]
*  Hey, by the way. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4218.76s)]
*  Cheers to Bert. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4219.76s)]
*  Cause it was his idea for us all to wear suits. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4220.76s)]
*  Cheers. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4222.76s)]
*  How long have you been doing these? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4223.76s)]
*  So the first one was the three of us and that was the weight loss challenge. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4229.76s)]
*  That's 2017? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4233.240000000001s)]
*  It was 2017. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4234.92s)]
*  I left there. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4235.92s)]
*  I left right, I left. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4236.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4237.92s)]
*  You guys did it right before I took off. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4238.92s)]
*  It was right before you became a New York comedian. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4239.92s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4242.24s)]
*  Best thing you ever did. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4243.24s)]
*  Best thing you ever did. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4244.24s)]
*  Best thing you ever did. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4245.24s)]
*  Well shut the fuck up. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4246.24s)]
*  I'm giving him a hard time. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4247.24s)]
*  Ari changed, Ari changed the scope of comedy. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4248.24s)]
*  I'm in the middle of giving him a hard time at Bert's Cockpocket. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4249.24s)]
*  All right, all right. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4251.24s)]
*  You know what? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4252.24s)]
*  Fuck you. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4253.24s)]
*  Ari changed the scope of comedy. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4254.24s)]
*  He did. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4255.24s)]
*  I did. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4256.24s)]
*  I united the scenes. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4257.24s)]
*  You did. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4258.24s)]
*  United the scenes. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4259.24s)]
*  You would not know Andrew Schultz without Ari. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4260.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4261.24s)]
*  True. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4262.24s)]
*  You don't know Chris DiStefano. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4263.24s)]
*  Is that a Rosary? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4264.24s)]
*  You may not know Tim Dillon without Ari branching. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4265.24s)]
*  No, I reached out to Tim Dillon. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4268.5199999999995s)]
*  No, I showed you a tweet of his and you're like, that's good. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4270.36s)]
*  Hey, that's true. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4272.84s)]
*  No doubt, you 100% introduced me to very funny comedians. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4273.84s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4277.48s)]
*  He's very funny. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4278.48s)]
*  Joe, you do not know the back tweets, back texts we have when we want to introduce you [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4279.48s)]
*  to people. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4283.88s)]
*  Why? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4284.88s)]
*  Because you are the biggest media brand in the world. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4285.88s)]
*  I don't like what? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4290.44s)]
*  Recommendations. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4291.44s)]
*  It's not true. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4292.639999999999s)]
*  I'll find it on my own. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4293.639999999999s)]
*  I do like to find as many things organically as possible. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4294.639999999999s)]
*  I recommended Brian Simpson. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4298.08s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely did. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4299.36s)]
*  He's the shit. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4300.679999999999s)]
*  Tommy's recommendations are different than me and Ari's. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4301.679999999999s)]
*  We recommended Shane Gillis for a year and a half. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4303.36s)]
*  How long did we text back and forth? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4305.24s)]
*  Ari one time. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4307.08s)]
*  I'm not taking this guy. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4308.08s)]
*  We were like, yo, we got to send him the Toyota Isis. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4309.08s)]
*  Then Ari's like, I'll send it, you reply and be like, how fucking funny is this, Ari? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4313.36s)]
*  Listen, I get to things. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4318.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God, you're right. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4320.0s)]
*  I get to things in the perfect amount of time. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4321.56s)]
*  You do. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4324.16s)]
*  It's all working out. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4325.16s)]
*  It's too overwhelming. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4326.84s)]
*  The wave that comes at me is too overwhelming. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4328.76s)]
*  So what I do is I just do my best to just stay present, think about what I want to talk [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4331.8s)]
*  about. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4337.44s)]
*  It's a lot of information coming in. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4338.44s)]
*  It's actually freeing because people are like, can you get me on Joe's podcast? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4339.44s)]
*  He's not going to listen to me. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4340.44s)]
*  So no, there's no point. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4341.44s)]
*  I had a guy, I'll say his name, guy reached out, wanted to be on Joe's podcast. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4343.32s)]
*  So fucking bad. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4347.48s)]
*  Are you sure you want to say his name? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4348.48s)]
*  Sure, I don't care. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4349.48s)]
*  I don't need to. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4350.959999999999s)]
*  Who is it? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4351.959999999999s)]
*  Theo Vonn. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4352.959999999999s)]
*  Wanted to be on Joe's podcast before you would have ever clocked him. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4353.959999999999s)]
*  And he was like, hey man, can you help me get on Joe's? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4356.799999999999s)]
*  And I said to Theo, you know what? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4358.719999999999s)]
*  It's not good if I take you to him. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4361.44s)]
*  Trust me. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4363.48s)]
*  I go, trust me, you're so fucking funny. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4364.48s)]
*  Joe's going to find you. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4366.4s)]

*  And Theo's first appearance on this podcast was a monster. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4371.839999999999s)]
*  And trust you, if I had said like, Joe, can you take my buddy? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  You would have. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4378.48s)]
*  And Theo's so bizarre that if you don't know who he is. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4379.48s)]
*  I almost always take comic recommendations. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4383.12s)]
*  Like if Ari recommends someone, I almost always, 100%. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4385.5199999999995s)]

*  No, I do. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4397.4s)]
*  I just don't, I filter them in when I see fit. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4398.4s)]
*  I have scientists and athletes and authors and movies. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4400.959999999999s)]
*  There's this funnel of people. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4406.6s)]
*  And I have to keep it in the realm of what do I want to do? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4410.320000000001s)]

*  Like they were great. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4430.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, like where you like, it doesn't have to be a comedian. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4431.4400000000005s)]
*  It could be athlete, actor, scientist, where you're just like, holy shit, that was amazing. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4433.64s)]
*  And you weren't expecting it. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4438.280000000001s)]
*  You know what, if I mentioned one, I would do a disservice to so many of them that have [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4439.88s)]
*  happened that way. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4444.92s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4445.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's just so many. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4446.92s)]
*  There's so many that people recommend. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4447.92s)]
*  Henry Rollins. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4449.400000000001s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4450.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, he was amazing. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4451.400000000001s)]
*  He was on a couple of times. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4452.400000000001s)]
*  And that was like one of those ones where I was like, I worried that we wouldn't get [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4453.400000000001s)]
*  along. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4458.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4459.52s)]
*  With Henry? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4460.52s)]
*  He's very volatile. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4461.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4462.52s)]
*  But like, in a weird way that I feel like... [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4464.400000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you struggled to. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4468.280000000001s)]
*  I feel like if you confront him with any aggression, he comes back at you tenfold and feels justified. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4469.400000000001s)]
*  You know, like I was on a radio station once in Austin and they had this conversation with [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4478.200000000001s)]
*  him and they said something and he interpreted what they said really badly. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4483.400000000001s)]
*  And then he went off on them and just fucking attacked them and just talking about how successful [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4488.400000000001s)]
*  he is. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4493.7s)]
*  And it was a weird conversation. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4494.7s)]
*  I love hearing those. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4496.42s)]
*  But I know guys like that. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4497.58s)]
*  I know guys like that from fighting. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4499.9s)]
*  There's certain guys that you just have to massage your relationship with them. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4501.94s)]
*  And I'm not saying that's Henry Rollins, but I'm saying it's guys who get angry really [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4507.06s)]
*  quickly and like maybe misread the room. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4510.54s)]
*  I think you know how to navigate that really well though. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4512.54s)]
*  And the dude, first of all, he was like... [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4514.34s)]
*  Henry Rollins at one point in time was like a fucking serious power lifter. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4516.58s)]
*  Have you ever seen... [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4520.38s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4521.38s)]
*  Yeah, when he did that video, I'm a Liar, do you ever see how jacked he is? [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4522.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4526.06s)]
*  He's always jacked. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4527.06s)]
*  Put up, I'm a liar. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4528.06s)]
*  But now, you know, he's like, he's like settled into his older years and he mostly does bodyweight [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4529.06s)]
*  stuff. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4535.18s)]
*  We actually had a conversation about it, but he wrote an amazing essay. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4536.18s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4538.62s)]
*  No, that's not him. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4539.62s)]
*  That's Franco Colombo, you son of a bitch. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4540.62s)]
*  No, there's a video, there's a music video. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4542.62s)]
*  That's it. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4545.9400000000005s)]
*  That's it. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4546.9400000000005s)]
*  I was like, he had a full head of hair. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4547.9400000000005s)]
*  See how he's screaming in that snapshot? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4548.98s)]
*  That is, that's from the video. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4552.099999999999s)]
*  That's from the music video. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4553.86s)]
*  The music video is, it has nothing to do with this essay, but he wrote an essay about lifting [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4555.5599999999995s)]
*  weights. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4562.9s)]
*  What is it called, Jamie? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4563.9s)]
*  Something about truth is in the iron? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4565.16s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4567.58s)]
*  Truth is in the iron is a badass statement. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4569.82s)]
*  The iron, that's what it is. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4571.7s)]
*  Does he say it here? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4574.0599999999995s)]
*  Give me volume. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4575.0599999999995s)]
*  The humiliation of teachers calling me garbage can and telling me I'd be mowing lawns for [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4576.06s)]
*  a living. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4581.3s)]
*  This is a kid reading Henry Rollins' book. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4583.8s)]
*  That's what that is. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4587.820000000001s)]
*  Pump with the chomp. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4588.820000000001s)]
*  Just get to the, go to the essay itself. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4590.06s)]
*  God, I like Henry Rollins. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4593.38s)]
*  Because it's an essay that he wrote, Henry Rollins, by the way, writes constantly. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4594.38s)]
*  He writes for a bunch of different publications. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4599.34s)]
*  He writes essays all the time and he listens to a shit ton of fucking, a shit ton of music, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4603.38s)]
*  like on vinyl. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4608.74s)]
*  He has this insane setup in his house where it's like $250,000 speakers. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4609.74s)]
*  It's madness. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4614.54s)]
*  He's just a music fiend. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4615.54s)]
*  So this is it. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4618.68s)]
*  I believe that by definition of definition, oh, I believe that the definition of definition [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4619.76s)]
*  is reinvention. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4625.1s)]
*  To not be like your parents, to not be like your friends, to be yourself completely. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4626.78s)]
*  When I was young, I had no sense of myself. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4630.5s)]
*  All I was was a product of all the fear and humiliation that I suffered. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4632.62s)]
*  Fear of my parents, the humiliation of teachers calling me garbage can and telling me that [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4636.66s)]
*  I'd be mowing lawns for a living. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4641.54s)]
*  And the very real terror of my fellow students. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4643.62s)]
*  I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4646.34s)]
*  I was skinny and clumsy. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4649.7s)]
*  And when others would tease me, I didn't run home crying, wondering why. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4651.56s)]
*  I knew all too well. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4656.24s)]
*  I was there to be antagonized. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4658.1s)]
*  In sports, I was laughed at, a spaz. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4659.82s)]
*  I was pretty good at boxing, but only because of the rage that filled my every waking moment, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4661.9s)]
*  made me wild and unpredictable. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4667.179999999999s)]
*  I fought with some strange fury. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4669.259999999999s)]
*  The other boys thought I was crazy. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4671.259999999999s)]
*  I hated myself all the time. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4672.58s)]
*  As stupid as it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4674.74s)]
*  the ease of knowing that I wasn't going to get pounded in the hallways between classes. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4679.42s)]
*  Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4684.46s)]
*  I only talked to a few boys in my grade, other losers. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4686.9s)]
*  Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4690.74s)]
*  Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4694.74s)]
*  respect, and you'll find a faithful friend forever. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4699.66s)]
*  But even with friends, school sucked, teachers gave me hard times. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4703.139999999999s)]
*  I can't read this forever. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4707.5s)]
*  This is going to bore you to shit. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4708.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4709.5s)]
*  Let's get to the weight part. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4710.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4711.5s)]
*  Have you ever had your head flushed down a toilet? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4712.5s)]
*  Me? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4715.62s)]

*  Have you? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4719.34s)]
*  Of course. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4720.34s)]
*  Really? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4721.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4722.34s)]
*  I love how you brought Henry Rollins again back to you. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4723.34s)]
*  I prefer to work out alone. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4725.26s)]
*  It's a pivotal moment in the thing. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4726.26s)]
*  Have you ever been violated like that? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4728.42s)]
*  What he's writing about is violation. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4730.46s)]
*  Was there anything in the toilet? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4732.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4733.62s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4734.62s)]
*  It was at Forest Hills baseball. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4735.62s)]
*  It's being violated. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4736.62s)]
*  You have to be held up by a group of boys and then they put your head in the toilet, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4737.62s)]
*  which flushed or not flushed. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4742.38s)]
*  It's a violation. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4744.22s)]
*  I'm not bringing it back to me. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4745.820000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying that's a very fucking powerful thing. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4747.38s)]
*  They were called swirlies. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4750.900000000001s)]
*  Swirlies. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4751.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4752.900000000001s)]
*  Through the years I have combined meditation, action and the iron into a single strength. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4753.900000000001s)]
*  I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4758.26s)]
*  Time spent away from the iron makes my mind degenerate. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4761.820000000001s)]
*  I wallow in a thick depression and my body shuts down, my mind. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4764.9400000000005s)]
*  The iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4768.7s)]
*  There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4771.780000000001s)]
*  Unless the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it's impossible to turn back. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4776.06s)]
*  The iron never lies to you. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4780.740000000001s)]
*  That's badass. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4782.740000000001s)]
*  Fucking perfect. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4783.740000000001s)]

*  That's perfect. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4785.740000000001s)]
*  That's 100% true. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4786.740000000001s)]
*  I feel that. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4787.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you embody that. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4788.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4789.740000000001s)]
*  But you were bullied as a kid. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4790.740000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4791.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4792.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was little. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4793.740000000001s)]
*  So I didn't like it and I didn't also moved into new neighborhoods all the time. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4794.740000000001s)]
*  I moved into new neighborhoods three or four times when I was a kid. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4798.740000000001s)]
*  Every time I was the new guy and I wasn't a big guy and dudes were fucking with me, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4803.34s)]
*  I was like, damn, I got to learn how to fight. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4807.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4809.34s)]
*  That was the 100% my motivation. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4810.34s)]
*  I wasn't like a kid that looked for fights ever. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4812.34s)]
*  I was just terrified. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4816.34s)]
*  I was like, okay, I'm tired of this. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4818.34s)]
*  What's the solution? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4820.34s)]
*  I got to learn martial arts, watch Bruce Lee movies. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4821.34s)]
*  I'm like, all right, I don't want to be like that guy. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4824.34s)]
*  Is that physically possible? [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4826.34s)]
*  What about, because what we were talking about right before was asking people things. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4827.34s)]
*  Because you've had so many fighters. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4831.9400000000005s)]
*  You love MMA and you're a great commentator. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4832.9400000000005s)]
*  I think you're a great analyst. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4836.9400000000005s)]
*  You really know so much about it. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4837.9400000000005s)]
*  It's fun to talk to you, to learn. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4839.9400000000005s)]
*  I think it's fun to learn. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4842.9400000000005s)]
*  But have you ever had a fighter that, you know, because you give honest takes on things [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4843.9400000000005s)]
*  when you're watching something. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4851.9400000000005s)]
*  You're like, this guy's ground game is not as strong or this guy's striking is what it is. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4852.9400000000005s)]
*  You're honest about it. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4857.9400000000005s)]
*  Have you ever had a fighter ever carry that comment and then come in here and been like, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4859.54s)]
*  I didn't really like him? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4864.54s)]
*  No, not in here. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4865.54s)]
*  I saw it once at dinner. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4866.54s)]
*  Where? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4867.54s)]
*  Heath Haring. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4868.54s)]
*  He was like, hey, you said some stuff about me, whatever, but just so you know, I was [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4869.54s)]
*  injured during that fight. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4872.54s)]
*  I was nursing a knee injury just so you're aware of what's going on. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4874.54s)]
*  I have to comment on what's happening. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4878.339999999999s)]
*  I would normal, like, I always give, if someone's like got an unusually bad performance, I will [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4881.74s)]
*  say, I will try to like give this. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4890.74s)]
*  Kind of qualify it. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4893.74s)]
*  You never know what's going on. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4894.74s)]
*  If you see a guy that carrying a little bit of extra weight, sometimes you see a little [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4895.74s)]
*  bit of love handles, like, hmm, that's weird. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4898.74s)]
*  His camp, it may be wasn't as strong. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4900.74s)]
*  There might have been something wrong. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4902.74s)]
*  And that's so fucking common. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4904.74s)]
*  Literally no fighter at a world class level goes into that octagon 100%. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4908.139999999999s)]
*  They just don't. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4913.139999999999s)]
*  They just don't. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4914.139999999999s)]
*  Someone's got a fucked up elbow. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4915.139999999999s)]
*  Someone's neck's kind of weird. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4917.139999999999s)]
*  Someone doesn't want to wrestle. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4918.139999999999s)]
*  Their knee's bad. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4919.139999999999s)]
*  Their ankle's fucked. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4920.139999999999s)]
*  They got their ankle taped. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4921.139999999999s)]
*  Why is his ankle taped? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4923.139999999999s)]
*  There's so many guys go in there with like real fucking injuries, man. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4925.139999999999s)]
*  Do they ever bring a hostility, like any hostility to a comment made? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4929.139999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4933.139999999999s)]
*  I've had conversations with guys, but over the years I've learned to express as much [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4934.54s)]
*  respect as I have. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4939.54s)]
*  You know, like sometimes you just comment again in the moment, like you would with friends, [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4941.54s)]
*  like, oh, he's breaking. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4944.54s)]
*  He's breaking. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4945.54s)]
*  You know, but you have to be careful, like how you say that when a guy is in a fight. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4946.54s)]
*  The guy's going to watch it and he knows he's breaking and you're just kind of compounding [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4951.54s)]
*  his awful moment. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4955.54s)]
*  Because guys break. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4957.54s)]
*  They do break. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4959.54s)]
*  But it's not my place to say that necessarily. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4960.94s)]
*  It is my place to comment on the technical aspects of how the exchange is going. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4963.94s)]
*  If I see them folding, if I see certain characteristics where they're not engaging, they're just moving [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4968.94s)]
*  in a defensive way and they seem to be looking for a way out. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4974.94s)]
*  Greg Jackson told me that he sees fighters accept that they're not going to win. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4979.94s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4983.94s)]
*  And then they're just fighting not to get knocked out. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4984.94s)]
*  Who did we see at the UFC? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4985.94s)]
*  100%. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4986.94s)]
*  I saw at the UFC Austin that like he was 40 and like he's been fighting for like 20 years. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4988.339999999999s)]
*  Benil Dariush. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4993.339999999999s)]
*  Man, that was crazy. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4994.339999999999s)]
*  The guy he fought though is a fucking assassin. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=4995.339999999999s)]
*  He has one loss to Gamrot and he has one loss to Ismael Makachev, who's the world champion [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5000.339999999999s)]
*  and by most people's eyes, at least number one or number two pound for pound in the world. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5010.339999999999s)]
*  What are you showing me? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5016.74s)]
*  So that guy, Armand Saryukhin, he's a fucking assassin and Benil Dariush, who's a very [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5020.74s)]
*  good fighter at this stage of his life is, you know, I don't know how old Benil is, but [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5027.34s)]
*  I think he's close to 40. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5033.9400000000005s)]
*  He's got gray hair. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5035.34s)]
*  That was the thing that stood out that you're like, man, can you imagine doing this at 40? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5037.14s)]
*  But he's also a very elite fighter. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5041.06s)]
*  Benil Dariush is fucking elite. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5044.62s)]
*  He's very good. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5046.82s)]
*  But the UFC is a clean sport. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5049.34s)]
*  Right now with the USADA gone and now, what is it the new company called? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5051.76s)]
*  Clean sport? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5060.62s)]
*  No. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5061.62s)]
*  So what? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5062.62s)]
*  So they still drug test. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5063.62s)]
*  So there is still a governing body. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5065.12s)]
*  And if you're going to be 40 years old, you're fighting at a disadvantage. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5067.22s)]
*  So the advantage would be that you know more, which is an advantage. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5071.46s)]
*  Like old Captain America. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5075.46s)]
*  There's an advantage of knowing more, but it's not enough of an advantage to deal with [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5077.26s)]
*  people who also know a lot. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5081.5s)]
*  And the young people, there's an acceleration that comes from watching things on YouTube [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5083.62s)]
*  and watching things streaming. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5087.38s)]
*  The young people are way better than the people that are older now were when they were that [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5089.26s)]
*  young. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5094.7s)]
*  Sure. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5095.7s)]
*  There's a drug free sport. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5096.7s)]
*  But the guy, he fought it. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5098.34s)]
*  The guy you were saying, wasn't he like 22 or something? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5099.98s)]
*  He's world class and he was world class when he was 20. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5103.78s)]
*  And the fight with Makachev was, it was a very close decision. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5106.66s)]
*  I don't remember if it was split. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5110.379999999999s)]
*  It might have been unanimous, but it was a super close decision. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5111.78s)]
*  So Benil's only 34? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5114.98s)]
*  No way. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5118.66s)]
*  Why'd you bring him up, Tom? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5119.66s)]
*  Benil's only 34. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5120.66s)]
*  I'm sorry, Benil. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5121.66s)]
*  It's your hair, brother. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5122.66s)]
*  Benil's going to be mad at me. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5123.66s)]
*  No, Benil's a very good guy. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5125.98s)]
*  He's a very, very smart guy. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5127.66s)]
*  He's going to take his walker over here and beat you with it. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5129.34s)]
*  He's also elite at jujitsu. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5131.3s)]
*  I don't remember why I brought him up. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5133.42s)]
*  We were talking about the fight. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5135.820000000001s)]
*  Just saying something. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5136.820000000001s)]
*  God damn, why did I think he was 40? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5137.820000000001s)]
*  It was just, I think at that fight someone had said 40 and I was just like, that is insane. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5139.26s)]
*  Oh, that's what it is. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5145.46s)]
*  That's insane to be, if that were true. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5147.46s)]
*  Can you imagine jumping in the outcome at 40 with a guy who's 21, 22? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5150.02s)]
*  But Randy Couture was world class when he was 40. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5155.66s)]
*  Yeah, Randy Couture was badass. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5158.86s)]
*  He was world class when he was 40. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5160.62s)]
*  But also, there was no USADA back then. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5163.259999999999s)]
*  So there's a few things going on. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5165.9s)]
*  How do you measure? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5167.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, Alistair Overeem isn't Alistair Overeem with USADA. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5168.339999999999s)]
*  This is not the same thing. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5174.66s)]
*  They didn't have any testing? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5176.259999999999s)]
*  It was a fucking intelligence test. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5179.259999999999s)]
*  He looks like he's not in the USADA. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5181.339999999999s)]
*  He's withered away. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5184.139999999999s)]
*  I think we'd also fought that night. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5185.139999999999s)]
*  He's 42. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5186.74s)]
*  Could have been him. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5187.74s)]
*  Yeah, Clay Guida. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5189.62s)]
*  Is that who he was talking about? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5190.62s)]
*  The Wild Man. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5191.62s)]
*  You're not talking about the guy who got knocked out. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5192.62s)]
*  No, no, I'm talking about this guy. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5194.34s)]
*  That's where our conversation got confused. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5195.9s)]
*  That's where it got confused. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5196.9s)]
*  No, Clay is 42. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5197.9s)]
*  So why'd you bring him up? [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5198.9s)]
*  Because he was at that fight. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5199.9s)]
*  Oh, he's gorgeous. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5200.9s)]
*  And you said, Joe said something about him or something like that? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5201.9s)]
*  What were you talking about? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5204.7s)]
*  I forget what the origin, I've been drinking. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5205.7s)]
*  I forget the origin of the drama. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5207.34s)]
*  How do you measure when you are a legit fan of someone and you kind of want them to win? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5208.34s)]
*  Yeah, you can't. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5213.099999999999s)]
*  Well, that was a real problem with being Shaub when Shaub would fight. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5214.820000000001s)]
*  Because I also knew that Shaub... [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5218.620000000001s)]
*  I know when someone has one foot in and one foot out, because I had one foot in and one [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5219.620000000001s)]
*  foot out when I started doing stand up. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5223.5s)]
*  I was still fighting when I was doing stand up. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5225.18s)]
*  And I know when you're not 100% focused, that's a dangerous place to be. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5227.06s)]
*  Because you can get overconfident and you think that you're still at the same level [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5231.18s)]
*  that you were at if you're 100% all in, but you're not. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5234.9800000000005s)]
*  You're not. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5239.26s)]
*  You're not. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5240.26s)]
*  The people that are 100% all in on being world champion are not also thinking about, I'm [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5241.42s)]
*  going to start this podcast and we're going to go do a tour and do stand up. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5247.66s)]
*  And now I'm making more money doing podcasts than I was doing fighting. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5252.58s)]
*  And now they're taking the promotions away. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5257.14s)]
*  I had more money from... [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5259.9800000000005s)]
*  Shaub had more money from ads on his shorts than he would get from his UFC paycheck. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5261.9800000000005s)]
*  So I knew he was one foot in, one foot out. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5268.08s)]
*  So with that situation, it's like, you got to stop. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5270.82s)]
*  Like, I've seen this. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5273.66s)]
*  You got to stop. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5274.66s)]
*  But some guys, you can't tell them to stop. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5275.66s)]
*  It's like they have this thing in their head and they want to figure out how to get to [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5277.5s)]
*  where they used to be one more time. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5283.82s)]
*  They think they can do it. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5286.179999999999s)]
*  They know they can do it. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5287.179999999999s)]
*  I feel like that was stand up. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5288.179999999999s)]
*  But I would root for a guy though. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5289.179999999999s)]
*  I'd be like, come on. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5290.42s)]
*  I'd be like, that would come out. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5291.42s)]
*  That's Tony Ferguson. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5292.42s)]
*  That's Tony Ferguson. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5293.42s)]
*  Everybody roots for Tony. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5294.42s)]
*  Everybody loves Tony. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5295.42s)]
*  Everybody roots for Tony to go back to when he was the boogie man. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5296.86s)]
*  Because El Kukui, that fucking guy, he just seemed impenetrable. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5300.06s)]
*  It didn't matter if you hurt him. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5305.06s)]
*  You weren't going to stop him. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5306.9800000000005s)]
*  He was coming forward. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5307.9800000000005s)]
*  He has a series of losses in a row now, right? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5308.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, it was really all from that one knee injury that he got backstage. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5311.38s)]
*  He tripped over wires and destroyed his knee. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5316.58s)]
*  That's how... [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5320.74s)]
*  You got to mitigate risk. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5321.74s)]
*  He was El Kukui. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5323.06s)]
*  He was the interim lightweight champion. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5325.78s)]
*  He was supposed to fight Khabib Nurmagomedov in Madison Square Garden. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5328.0199999999995s)]
*  And he tripped over wires? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5332.099999999999s)]
*  In the promo leading up to the show, he was doing one of those ESPN things or whatever. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5334.74s)]
*  And there were some wires on the ground. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5340.9s)]
*  He didn't see them and he tripped on them. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5342.179999999999s)]
*  And he wrecked his knee that way? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5344.0599999999995s)]
*  Wrecked his knee. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5345.74s)]
*  Tore it apart. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5346.74s)]
*  Had to have surgery. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5348.099999999999s)]
*  That part would piss me off so much. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5349.099999999999s)]
*  Go skiing. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5351.139999999999s)]
*  That's the way... [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5352.139999999999s)]
*  That's how it happened. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5353.139999999999s)]
*  He comes back. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5354.3s)]
*  He beats Anthony Pettis. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5355.3s)]
*  Lower that rib. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5358.3s)]
*  That would bother me less. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5360.38s)]
*  Are you 100% now? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5362.02s)]
*  On the knee, yes. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5363.58s)]
*  On the arm, no. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5364.58s)]
*  Which is the opposite of what they tell you. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5365.58s)]
*  Can you jerk off? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5367.02s)]
*  When they told me... [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5368.02s)]
*  You don't jerk off left handed, you fucking psycho. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5369.02s)]
*  You don't, fucking rookie. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5371.38s)]
*  When you're in the hospital, they point to your arm. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5372.38s)]
*  Way to turn that around quickly. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5375.54s)]
*  They go, this is not going to be a problem. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5376.780000000001s)]
*  This is going to be a problem. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5380.18s)]
*  And you're like, oh, okay. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5381.660000000001s)]
*  Because you think, oh... [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5382.9s)]
*  And now your knee's 100%? [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5383.9s)]
*  100%. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5384.9s)]
*  But I have nerve damage in my arm. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5385.9s)]
*  So it might never ever, ever be what it was. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5388.34s)]
*  Damn. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5392.82s)]
*  So where's it at now? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5393.82s)]
*  Well, it's just that for life, it's fine. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5394.82s)]
*  I can do anything. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5397.82s)]
*  You're from high level athletics? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5398.82s)]
*  So with heavy... [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5401.22s)]
*  I don't know if I'll ever be able to lift anything heavy again. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5402.22s)]
*  Can you beat Bird of Tennis? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5405.94s)]
*  External rotation, it really is bad. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5408.94s)]
*  But even when you have a heavy weight in your hand... [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5413.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, I get wrist collapse at a certain weight. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5415.1s)]
*  So this hand will be fine. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5417.1s)]
*  And at a certain weight, this list, it'll collapse. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5419.1s)]
*  And then you feel things all in the elbow area with heavy weight. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5422.1s)]
*  So I don't know if I'll ever... [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5427.1s)]
*  Not that I need to. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5429.1s)]
*  So that's the thing. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5430.1s)]
*  It's like you go, I don't need to be a power lifter. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5431.1s)]
*  But it still kind of... [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5434.1s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks when you're in there and you're like, oh, my whole arm has these crazy vibrations [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5435.1s)]
*  and pains going on with heavy weight. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5440.78s)]
*  So you just have to shift what you do. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5442.78s)]
*  That's why I stopped doing jujitsu for a whole year. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5444.78s)]
*  I started getting these nerve pains in my fingers. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5447.78s)]
*  If you push on my forearm, my whole hand will go numb. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5450.78s)]
*  What? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5454.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5455.78s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5456.78s)]
*  Any nerve thing is super dangerous. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5457.78s)]
*  They took it out of here. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5458.78s)]
*  I have no nerve here. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5459.78s)]
*  What? [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5460.78s)]
*  Yeah, I have none. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5461.78s)]
*  They took it out and they put it in here. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5462.78s)]
*  Do you mean tendon? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5463.78s)]
*  No, it took the nerve out. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5464.78s)]
*  So what happens is... [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5466.5s)]
*  It took your nerve out. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5467.5s)]
*  They took the nerve out because... [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5468.5s)]
*  Did you reconnect nerves? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5469.5s)]
*  Yeah, I had a state of the art surgery at the time. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5471.42s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5472.42s)]
*  So when the guy did it, I was like, how many of these have you done? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5473.42s)]
*  He goes, one. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5475.42s)]
*  I go, oh, no. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5476.42s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5477.42s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5478.42s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5479.42s)]
*  Because you have two nerves and two muscles here to let you pronate. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5480.42s)]
*  So they take it out. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5483.42s)]
*  Can you explain what was happening that the fingers, the last fingers were coming back? [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5484.42s)]
*  This is what would happen. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5488.7s)]
*  They would go... [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5489.7s)]
*  They go... [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5490.7s)]
*  It was... [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5491.7s)]
*  They go... [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5492.9s)]
*  It was... [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5493.9s)]
*  The injury is in December. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5494.9s)]
*  And in like March, they do a nerve test and they go, everything is not firing. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5497.9s)]
*  How are you functioning? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5505.22s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, you know... [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5506.7s)]
*  And there were things that were notable. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5508.099999999999s)]
*  If I went to pick something up, you might not notice, right? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5510.22s)]
*  But I would just grab it and then grab... [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5513.82s)]
*  My hand didn't open all the way. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5517.26s)]
*  So if you go like this... [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5518.82s)]
*  I would go like this with my healthy hand and I would go like this. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5520.18s)]
*  And that was the most I could do. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5523.5s)]
*  And they told me, they go, if you wait a year, if you wait a year and the nerve doesn't fire [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5525.9800000000005s)]
*  and reconnect on its own, your body consumes a nodule. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5532.740000000001s)]
*  It just consumes them. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5537.1s)]
*  It's like, you ever seen somebody who has a hand that just doesn't work anymore? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5538.1s)]
*  That's it. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5541.22s)]
*  That's what that is. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5542.22s)]
*  That's that nerve damage. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5543.22s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5544.22s)]
*  So... [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5545.22s)]
*  I just want you to wait it out. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5546.26s)]
*  Just know that where you are could be just where you are forever. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5547.26s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5551.62s)]
*  And so when he told me that, he's like, or I could do this surgery that's like... [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5552.900000000001s)]
*  It was actually a Brazilian surgeon who came up with this idea, like this process, this [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5557.34s)]
*  surgery. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5561.66s)]
*  And he goes, it works, you know, 100% confident in it. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5562.66s)]
*  It's a hospice surgery. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5565.46s)]
*  And then he just... [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5566.46s)]
*  He's in a enormous chair. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5569.46s)]
*  When it starts to hurt, you turn your fucking card over to red. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5570.46s)]
*  More, more, please. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5576.46s)]
*  More, more, more. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5579.46s)]
*  More, more, more knee. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5581.46s)]
*  But then he did it. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5582.9800000000005s)]
*  And dude, like, you know, I can... [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5583.9800000000005s)]
*  I go all the way. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5585.9800000000005s)]
*  And I can pick things up. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5587.46s)]
*  But there's things where... [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5588.860000000001s)]
*  So you'll think... [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5590.34s)]
*  You would think it's strength, but it's not strength. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5591.34s)]
*  It's the nerve firing. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5592.900000000001s)]
*  Like if I pick up something heavy, I gotta pick it up and with my right arm, pull it up. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5593.900000000001s)]
*  And my left arm is here and you go, oh, I guess you're just not strong. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5598.26s)]
*  It's not strength. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5600.9400000000005s)]
*  It's that the nerve isn't firing. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5601.9400000000005s)]
*  It's just not sending the signal. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5603.860000000001s)]
*  It won't tell it to go. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5604.860000000001s)]
*  It won't tell it to go all the way. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5606.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5607.5s)]
*  Dude, in the lone loss in my career where I got TKO'd, I got hit with a left hook. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5608.5s)]
*  And I got hit with a left hook and my legs shut off. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5613.98s)]
*  Totally shut off. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5617.0199999999995s)]
*  It's the weirdest sensation of all time. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5618.0199999999995s)]
*  I got hit with this hook. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5620.66s)]
*  It hit my arm and chin and my legs just stopped working. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5622.42s)]
*  Just stopped working. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5625.4s)]
*  I'm conscious. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5626.4s)]
*  My legs just stopped working. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5627.4s)]
*  They just completely collapsed. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5629.219999999999s)]
*  And so the referee starts counting. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5631.099999999999s)]
*  One, two. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5632.5s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5633.5s)]
*  It's a pretty new experience. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5636.78s)]
*  All my years of competing never had that. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5637.78s)]
*  Never had that. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5638.78s)]
*  So then I stand up and I'm like, these things aren't working right. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5639.78s)]
*  And then this dude's throwing punches at me and they stop the fight. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5642.5s)]
*  But it was a fascinating experience because it's not about heart and will. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5645.66s)]
*  They just stop working. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5654.46s)]
*  Haven't you had Zach better on before? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5655.86s)]
*  And he just did that thing where he's an elite, elite ultra marathon runner. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5658.299999999999s)]
*  He was out on one of these 100-milers and at 80 miles, he was like, I felt sick. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5663.9s)]
*  I had to lay down. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5671.38s)]
*  I tried to rest. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5672.38s)]
*  He posted about it. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5673.46s)]
*  And he's like, my legs, they just shut down. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5675.7s)]
*  So at a certain point, he just goes, I'm tapping out of this one. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5679.219999999999s)]
*  And it's different than obviously getting hit, but his body just was like, it's not [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5683.179999999999s)]
*  from fire. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5686.94s)]
*  That's enough. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5687.94s)]
*  It's just like, it's over. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5688.94s)]
*  Not happening. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5689.94s)]
*  That's kind of like, this is... [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5690.94s)]
*  The thing about these people that are pushing themselves like Zach Bitter does or David [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5692.0199999999995s)]
*  Goggins does is that inevitably, they're going to get damaged to that body. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5695.0599999999995s)]
*  David has to. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5701.7s)]
*  Oh no, he already has. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5702.7s)]
*  That's bad. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5703.7s)]
*  He's shared it. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5704.7s)]
*  He's shared it. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5705.7s)]
*  He sent me videos of his leg where he takes his leg and he compresses his fingers around [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5706.7s)]
*  it and the edema around his shin is so thick that his fingers are embedded in his shin. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5712.179999999999s)]
*  He had his knee severed and then reconnected. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5719.54s)]
*  He has no cartilage. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5724.0199999999995s)]
*  He's bone on bone. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5725.54s)]
*  What's that going to be like? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5726.54s)]
*  The doctor's... [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5727.54s)]
*  He's going to get replacements, 100%. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5728.54s)]
*  His doctor looked at his knee and said, I can't believe you can fucking walk on this. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5730.78s)]
*  Never mind run thousands of miles. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5734.42s)]
*  Thousands. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5736.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's his leg. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5737.42s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5738.42s)]
*  That's edema on his leg. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5739.42s)]
*  That's from him just putting his fingers on his leg. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5741.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's after one of multiple surgeries he's had. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5743.26s)]
*  What is edema, if you don't mind me asking? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5746.78s)]
*  It's the swelling. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5748.46s)]
*  It's like all this fluid. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5749.58s)]
*  It's basically just fucking torn up. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5752.14s)]
*  He's an animal. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5755.06s)]
*  He's like, don't be a bitch. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5756.06s)]
*  Bro, he's an animal. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5757.06s)]
*  When he came to my podcast, he got there early. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5758.06s)]
*  When I walked in, he was already doing chin ups. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5759.9400000000005s)]
*  He was? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5761.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5762.74s)]
*  When I first met him, I went into the gym. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5763.74s)]
*  The podcast starts at whatever it started at. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5765.78s)]
*  I get there and I meet his wife. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5767.78s)]
*  I go back and he's back there doing chin ups with his shirt off. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5771.7s)]
*  There's no reason to rest. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5778.860000000001s)]
*  Why am I resting right here? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5780.06s)]
*  There's a whole full gym. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5781.06s)]
*  Can I use this gym? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5782.54s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5784.22s)]
*  He just goes out there and he's doing chin ups. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5785.22s)]
*  What a great way to maximize your time. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5787.5s)]
*  You just sit there like, I guess we're early. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5789.62s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5793.1s)]
*  There's a gym right there. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5794.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5795.1s)]
*  Let's get some ice. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5796.1s)]
*  Look at his toes. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5797.1s)]
*  The water. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5798.1s)]
*  Look at his toes. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5799.1s)]
*  No. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5800.1s)]
*  Look at the screen. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5801.1s)]
*  No. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5802.1s)]
*  Tommy. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5803.1s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5804.1s)]
*  That's Goggins' toe. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5805.1s)]
*  Eat it. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5806.1s)]
*  That's from running. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5807.1s)]
*  He ran some insane amount of 100-milers in a short period of time. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5808.1s)]
*  Can I tell you the most human thing about him is that he reads negative comments. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5812.620000000001s)]
*  When you see that he gets upset about them. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5818.18s)]
*  He listens to them when he runs. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5820.9800000000005s)]
*  That's where I connect with the guy where I go, who would ever hate on David Goggins? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5823.9800000000005s)]
*  That guy has nothing but inspiration on me. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5829.46s)]
*  There's people that are going to hate on every fucking thing that has ever existed. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5831.820000000001s)]
*  It's not an honest perspective. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5836.98s)]
*  It's flavored by their own inadequacy. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5838.58s)]
*  A big part of it is flavored by their own fucking disastrous life. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5841.38s)]
*  David Goggins is what I listen to. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5845.0199999999995s)]
*  If I'm hungover, I go to the gym, I throw on David Goggins, they got a thing on him. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5847.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm going to fucking throw one of those in too. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5851.62s)]
*  One one? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5853.5s)]
*  This is a three. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5854.5s)]
*  This one's a six. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5855.5s)]
*  I'll take a six. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5856.5s)]
*  No. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5857.5s)]
*  Six rogue. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5858.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I like. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5859.5s)]
*  Here you go, brother. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5860.5s)]
*  I like running the horse. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5861.5s)]

*  Tommy turn me on to them too. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5863.5s)]
*  Yeah, the rogues are good. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5864.5s)]
*  They're very tasty. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5865.5s)]
*  I don't take as many of them in as I do with the zins. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5867.46s)]
*  I'll take those any day over people fucking dipping. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5870.66s)]
*  Oh, dipping's so sexy. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5872.74s)]
*  You're wrong. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5874.74s)]
*  You're wrong. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5875.74s)]
*  My friend Perry, he was the stunt coordinator on Fear Factor. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5876.74s)]
*  He was a stunt coordinator on so many movies that back in the day, we're talking about [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5879.9s)]
*  the early 2000s, and for him deep in the 90s and probably the 80s, you weren't encouraged [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5885.14s)]
*  to be spitting on set. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5891.54s)]
*  Yeah, you had to gut it. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5893.22s)]
*  So he would just swallow it. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5894.98s)]
*  So Perry got accustomed to swallowing his own tobacco just like, that's a fucking man. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5897.34s)]
*  That's a shot of John Crutch. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5904.22s)]
*  That's a shot of John Crutch. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5905.22s)]
*  John Crutch gutted it. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5906.22s)]
*  He had dipped it in his, slid it in first, cut his whole lip up, and he was like on that [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5907.22s)]
*  side, he took it all out and pushed to the other side. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5911.62s)]
*  Oh, this one's good. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5915.22s)]
*  Which one is? [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5920.38s)]
*  You can taste it. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5921.38s)]
*  I'm going to taste it immediately. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5922.38s)]
*  Those are good. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5923.38s)]
*  Those are experiment. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5924.38s)]
*  All right, what is this month you're doing? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5925.38s)]
*  I'm doing some time off. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5927.34s)]
*  Why don't you just do it on October like we were supposed to do it? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5928.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5929.34s)]
*  Because we never do. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5930.34s)]
*  Who are you doing it with? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5931.34s)]
*  I'm doing it myself. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5932.34s)]
*  No, we don't never do it, are we? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5933.34s)]
*  We do it by yourself. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5934.34s)]
*  This year we didn't do it. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5935.34s)]
*  I did. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5936.34s)]
*  I'm just doing it to do it. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5937.34s)]
*  I did it this year. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5938.34s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5939.34s)]
*  I did it by myself. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5940.34s)]
*  No weed? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5941.34s)]
*  Nothing? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5942.34s)]
*  No, come on, I'm not sober. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5943.34s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, that's not sober. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5944.34s)]
*  I'm doing no weed. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5945.34s)]
*  No, no, no, I did October without weed, and then I started doing weed, and I was like, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5946.34s)]
*  weed's the fucking best. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5947.34s)]
*  It really is the best. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5948.34s)]
*  I'm doing no weed, no coffee. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5949.34s)]
*  Weed is essentially steroids for comedy. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5951.38s)]

*  You're right, it is. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5955.02s)]
*  Or it's a helps, it hurts you. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5956.02s)]
*  I think it can hurt you if you're a bitch. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5958.02s)]
*  I think weed is at its best when you get off stage and you take a couple hits, it almost [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5961.02s)]
*  just goes, hey man, we're good. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5968.46s)]
*  Let's get in bed and watch a documentary on tarpon fishing. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5971.22s)]
*  You should sit on it. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5973.9800000000005s)]
*  And you're like, fuck yeah. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5974.9800000000005s)]
*  It's the coolest, man. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5975.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I never finished telling you this. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5977.9800000000005s)]
*  So they say, what do you want after your set at the Wilbur? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5979.82s)]
*  And I was like, I'm cool. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5982.259999999999s)]
*  Sometimes after I get off, I like a glass of scotch. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5983.259999999999s)]
*  And I finished, the last time I was there, I was like, thank you, good night. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5986.54s)]
*  And I took one step down and she just hands me a glass of scotch. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5988.78s)]
*  And I was like, I've never been treated like this in my life. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5992.82s)]
*  It was so fucking nice. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5995.179999999999s)]
*  Fuck yeah, that's thoughtful. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5996.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, a nice glass of scotch after you just did what you needed to do. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=5997.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was thinking about you in the shower this morning. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6002.54s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6005.58s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6006.58s)]
*  These guys always make it weird. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6007.58s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6008.58s)]
*  I'm broken. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6010.34s)]
*  What position? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6011.34s)]
*  I was just, I was washing my armpits. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6012.34s)]
*  And I thought. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6013.34s)]
*  Oh, normal. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6014.34s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6015.34s)]
*  That's when I think about R.A. too. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6016.34s)]
*  It's a cheat code. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6017.34s)]
*  I'm on my armpits. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6018.34s)]
*  You want to know, I tell you why sometimes I think about R.A. when I wash my armpits. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6019.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6022.34s)]
*  Because I would love to hear it. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6023.34s)]
*  The amount of deodorant I put on? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6024.34s)]
*  No, no. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6027.34s)]
*  No, I do think about you when I put on deodorant though. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6028.34s)]
*  I lost enough weight that I have an armpit again. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6031.74s)]
*  What did you have before, a gut? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6033.54s)]
*  No, it was just fat. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6036.38s)]
*  You couldn't feel the tendons in your peck in your back. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6037.66s)]
*  What? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6040.38s)]
*  So like it's just a fold. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6041.38s)]
*  It's not like an armpit. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6042.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6043.38s)]
*  And so now you're like, oh, he's going to be jealous? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6044.38s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6046.38s)]
*  I was thinking, I have a little buzz so I'll share it. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6047.7s)]
*  But I was thinking, how cool is it that you've had moments in your career where everyone's [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6051.3s)]
*  like fucking write that guy off and you're killing it. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6056.54s)]
*  And you're killing it. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6059.14s)]
*  And then you start thinking. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6060.14s)]
*  That has to do with armpits? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6061.14s)]
*  No, no. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6062.14s)]
*  Armpits thought of R.A. and then I thought of R.A. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6063.14s)]
*  I've been thinking about R.A. all day because of what happened last night. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6066.26s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6068.860000000001s)]
*  And so and I thought, you know, with what happened last night, I thought I love that [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6069.860000000001s)]
*  there's forgiveness in this world. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6076.3s)]
*  And I love that he's got to I love that he's killing it right now. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6077.5s)]
*  People that don't want to forgive people that are actively trying to be better people are [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6080.780000000001s)]
*  bad people. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6087.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6088.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6089.06s)]
*  There's a negative aspect to this non-forgiveness mindset that is inescapable. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6090.06s)]
*  It's not good for the person that perpetuates it. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6096.02s)]
*  It's definitely not good for the people that receive it. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6098.9s)]
*  If you have this fear that you'll be cast out of the kingdom forever for a thing that [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6101.46s)]
*  you deeply regret and you might have done in duress or you might have done for whatever [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6108.5s)]
*  fucking reason. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6112.74s)]
*  But you realize as a human being, how could I have done that if you're not willing to [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6113.74s)]
*  say, I get it, we're all human and I believe your intention. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6118.82s)]
*  Give me a hug. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6123.34s)]
*  Let's work this out. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6124.34s)]
*  If you can't do that, you're the problem. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6126.22s)]
*  The problem is the unforgiving mindset, the least charitable perspective on every person [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6127.9800000000005s)]
*  you run into because you think that somehow or another that elevates you, but it doesn't. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6134.860000000001s)]
*  And they make you stick to this mistake. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6139.7s)]
*  When Kevin Hart was like trying to be nice about gays and they're like, well, where was [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6141.860000000001s)]
*  that then? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6144.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, he's being nice. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6145.860000000001s)]
*  And this is your moment to shit on him? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6146.860000000001s)]
*  Also Kevin Hart was trying to be famous and trying to get laughs. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6149.18s)]
*  Trying to get laughs. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6154.06s)]
*  When you try to get laughs, you will say things you don't believe, but you think will be effective. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6155.780000000001s)]
*  And it's a sign of a comedian that's not that good yet. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6160.700000000001s)]
*  It's a normal thing that we all did. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6164.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6166.42s)]
*  And still do. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6167.42s)]
*  I still do. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6168.42s)]
*  I'm watching people take wild chances at the mothership. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6169.42s)]
*  And I know the audience sometimes goes, why does he care about that? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6176.5s)]
*  And you're going, no, it's this thing in his head and he's trying to find something. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6179.660000000001s)]
*  I think the audience at the mothership is more aware of that than most clubs because [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6183.78s)]
*  we talk about it so much. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6187.58s)]
*  The process of creating a bit is sometimes you have to trot it out there and while you're [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6189.34s)]
*  saying it, you're free balling and you might go down the wrong path and kind of get committed [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6195.46s)]
*  to it. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6200.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6201.9800000000005s)]
*  And then you're stuck on a route. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6202.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6203.9800000000005s)]
*  Just like, well, let me try to get out of this. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6204.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's how new bits are created. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6205.9800000000005s)]
*  There's new bits that get created because of that. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6207.74s)]
*  That's why I hate when people push yourself into a corner. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6210.42s)]
*  I see somebody like, that guy's not good. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6212.14s)]
*  I'm like, he's trying something. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6213.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6214.14s)]
*  Let him figure it out. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6215.14s)]
*  That's what infuriated me. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6216.14s)]
*  Infuriated me about Louis CK's leak set. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6219.14s)]
*  Oh, I thought about that today. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6224.14s)]
*  When comics were going after him, I'm like, are you lying to the normies about the process? [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6225.14s)]
*  It's also one of those things where I remember when that happened and you're like, we should [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6232.14s)]
*  not lose this list of names. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6236.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I've never lost that list of names. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6239.58s)]
*  It's fucking cunts where you're like, it's so obvious, by the way, that this is a pop-in, [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6242.74s)]
*  like I'm working this shit out. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6249.099999999999s)]
*  It's a workout set. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6250.46s)]
*  He hasn't done standup in 10 months. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6251.46s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6253.62s)]
*  No standup in 10 months. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6254.62s)]
*  And every one of those premises had promise. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6256.419999999999s)]
*  Also, yeah, they were good. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6259.339999999999s)]
*  Every one of them. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6260.339999999999s)]
*  I would relate it to people when they were like, what's going on? [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6261.339999999999s)]
*  I would tell them. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6262.339999999999s)]
*  They'd laugh at me retelling that joke. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6263.339999999999s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6265.0199999999995s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6266.0199999999995s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6267.0199999999995s)]
*  Unique take. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6268.0199999999995s)]
*  What is your fucking tomatoes? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6269.26s)]
*  He might be the most fun person to watch workout period, too. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6273.900000000001s)]

*  I had no idea if I could even do it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6531.94s)]
*  I literally hadn't benched in forever. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6533.62s)]
*  All I do is kettlebells. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6536.22s)]
*  The heaviest weight I do is 70 pounds. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6537.88s)]
*  Hey, would you ever think about posting [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6539.74s)]
*  when you program for your workout? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6541.62s)]
*  I would love to know what you do. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6543.78s)]
*  Do you ever post it on Instagram? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6545.7s)]
*  It's real simple. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6546.54s)]
*  Do you do circuits? [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6547.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I do circuits. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6548.2s)]
*  But I think there's a real value to doing, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6549.22s)]
*  there's a bunch of exercises that are standards. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6553.98s)]
*  Like straight leg deadlifts, clean and press. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6557.1s)]
*  These things are- [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6562.54s)]
*  Do you start with swings? [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6563.38s)]
*  Do you do like- [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6564.22s)]
*  I start with pushups and bodyweight squats. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6565.04s)]
*  I start with cold plunge. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6566.38s)]
*  Every workout's three minutes, 34 degrees. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6568.1s)]
*  Boom, go from there, 20 bodyweight squats, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6570.18s)]
*  20 pushups, 20 bodyweight squats, 20 pushups. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6572.78s)]
*  You do two sets in a row so that you get two sets of legs, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6575.0199999999995s)]
*  two sets of pushups so that you get warm up. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6578.0599999999995s)]
*  Then you do the final three, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6580.44s)]
*  you get to 100 pushups, 100 bodyweight squats. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6582.84s)]
*  Then it's kettlebells. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6585.360000000001s)]
*  And if I'm on a regular schedule, it's 70 pounds. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6587.24s)]
*  So I go to 70 pounds, 10 swings each arm, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6591.1s)]
*  three sets, 10 presses each arm, three sets, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6596.12s)]
*  10 windmills each arm, three sets, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6599.8s)]
*  10 renegade rows each arm, three sets. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6602.64s)]
*  Foc, renegade rows. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6605.08s)]
*  With 70 pounds at the end of that is rough. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6606.52s)]
*  Then you go to the sled. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6608.84s)]
*  Then you go to the sled. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6610.46s)]
*  Oh, sled. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6611.68s)]
*  And then it's the torque sled, pushing it, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6612.52s)]
*  you're pushing it about 35 meters. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6614.620000000001s)]
*  And then you're pushing it and you're pulling it back. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6618.660000000001s)]
*  And we do that, we'll do that for three sets. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6620.820000000001s)]
*  You work with someone? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6622.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I just do it in my head [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6623.900000000001s)]
*  and then I have comics do it with me. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6626.14s)]
*  Oh, I've been there for those. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6628.58s)]
*  So then we go from there to Tabatas on the heavy bag. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6629.8s)]
*  Tabatas are 20 second sprint followed by 10 second rest. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6633.54s)]
*  So we do that and we blast out the end of the workout. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6637.52s)]
*  We put the rock through this. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6640.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6641.900000000001s)]
*  And the end of the workout, you're. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6642.740000000001s)]
*  You quit? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6643.56s)]
*  No, the rock is fucking, he was cool, man. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6645.219999999999s)]
*  He's humble. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6647.139999999999s)]
*  He didn't, he's not a kettlebell guy. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6648.379999999999s)]
*  He had never done cold plunge before, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6650.9s)]
*  before he did it with us. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6652.66s)]
*  What? [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6653.5s)]
*  Yeah, never done it. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6654.339999999999s)]

*  He was, there was no, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6656.86s)]
*  guys built like a fucking superhero, right? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6659.44s)]
*  But I think he's also doing a lot of stuff [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6663.0199999999995s)]
*  to increase like the aesthetics. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6665.44s)]

*  So he's doing a lot of machines. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6669.259999999999s)]
*  If you look at his Iron Paradise, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6670.54s)]

*  By the way, American flag fucking prominently displayed. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6675.16s)]
*  When you look at that setup, that setup is a setup, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6677.759999999999s)]
*  it's perfect for a guy who wants to look like a superhero [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6681.16s)]
*  in a movie. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6684.08s)]
*  It's perfect. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6684.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6685.74s)]

*  is as you get older, your face, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6843.0599999999995s)]
*  your skin starts to get thinner, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6845.9800000000005s)]
*  because you have a lack of collagen, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6848.26s)]
*  and you start looking like you're like, ugh, it looks sick. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6849.94s)]
*  Even if you feel good, your skin has more laxity. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6853.42s)]

*  Red light therapy. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6863.76s)]
*  What is it, just like a thing? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6864.58s)]
*  We could talk about it, but I don't know what I'm saying, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6865.42s)]
*  so I'd be bullshit. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6867.5s)]
*  It shoots light at you? [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6868.34s)]

*  You see people with the masks sometimes. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6872.84s)]
*  I do that for my head. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6874.92s)]

*  because both of them are really good for you. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6894.08s)]
*  The flotation tank is, there's a reset [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6896.28s)]
*  that I think you can achieve from that. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=6899.46s)]

*  If he's cool, we become friendly. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7239.46s)]
*  Danny's fantastic. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7240.58s)]
*  I brought Daniel Simonson. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7241.42s)]
*  That's his number one guy. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7242.54s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7244.22s)]
*  Simonson's like, what do you mean? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7245.06s)]
*  I was sure. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7247.34s)]
*  And we're having a conversation. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7248.18s)]
*  I was like, what's so cool? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7249.02s)]
*  What about the weather? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7249.84s)]
*  I don't know, whatever. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7250.68s)]
*  And I look over and Daniel's just like, ha ha ha. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7251.52s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7253.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7253.86s)]
*  Really? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7254.68s)]
*  He's trying to be cool. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7255.52s)]
*  I was trying to navigate the conversation [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7256.36s)]
*  without looking like. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7259.22s)]
*  You realize I would have been like, [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7260.22s)]
*  if you had worked with him for a year, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7261.24s)]
*  I would have walked in and been like, I know Tom Skurra. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7262.74s)]
*  I just. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7264.74s)]
*  That's so who I am. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7266.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I was, I mean, here's the thing. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7267.82s)]
*  You say that, like, cause you were in my mind. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7269.58s)]
*  And the fact that you guys worked together [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7272.26s)]
*  was a natural thing to bring up. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7273.46s)]
*  But it was also, I think, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7275.38s)]
*  when you're in, sometimes in those situations, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7277.56s)]
*  you're like, when's the time to say this? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7279.84s)]
*  You're kind of nervous about how you say it. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7282.24s)]
*  And you're looking for the end to say it. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7284.16s)]
*  So if I had talked to him for longer, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7285.92s)]
*  it would have been a normal thing to bring up. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7288.0s)]
*  Cheers, I love drinking with you. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7290.12s)]
*  Okay, I love drinking with you too. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7291.6s)]
*  And I'm Ari. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7292.72s)]
*  Oh, Ari, you're so gay. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7294.5199999999995s)]
*  You're not drinking? [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7295.36s)]
*  Yeah, I got another week. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7296.72s)]
*  Yeah, that little dog. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7299.88s)]
*  Oh, it's so fucking cute. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7301.36s)]
*  The cutest thing I've ever seen. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7302.84s)]
*  I think we should. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7304.36s)]
*  It's so fucking cute. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7305.2s)]
*  Oh, you're so cute. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7306.04s)]
*  I just swallow his face. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7307.1s)]
*  Hey, Joe, can I ask you a question? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7308.42s)]
*  Sure. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7310.26s)]
*  So when you watched Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz fight, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7311.1s)]
*  did you want one of them to win? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7312.94s)]
*  No. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7314.28s)]
*  Okay. Really? [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7315.12s)]
*  No, for real. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7315.96s)]
*  I wanted Nate to win. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7316.8s)]
*  This is where we started. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7317.64s)]
*  The main problem I had during commentary was Shaw. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7318.46s)]
*  That was the only problem I really ever had. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7321.98s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of guys I love. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7323.66s)]
*  I love Donald Cowboy Cerrone. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7325.14s)]
*  I fucking love that dude. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7327.14s)]
*  I love him. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7329.0199999999995s)]
*  I wish there was more men like that in this world. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7330.3s)]
*  I love him to death. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7333.5199999999995s)]
*  But when he's fighting Conor McGregor, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7334.86s)]
*  I can't have a favorite. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7336.580000000001s)]
*  I just have to let it happen. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7338.9400000000005s)]
*  These guys, they're all professionals. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7340.46s)]
*  That's impossible. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7342.580000000001s)]
*  Even if they had a favorite, I love both of them. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7343.42s)]
*  I do it. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7345.26s)]
*  I swear to God, I do it. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7346.34s)]
*  Even when Sean Strickland fought Israel Adesandia, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7347.42s)]
*  Izzy's my friend. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7349.820000000001s)]
*  I love Izzy. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7350.860000000001s)]
*  I love him. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7351.700000000001s)]
*  He's the shit. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7352.54s)]
*  He's the motherfucker. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7353.360000000001s)]
*  He defended me when that whole N-word video came out. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7354.200000000001s)]
*  Dude, that made me tear up. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7358.38s)]
*  I love that dude. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7360.580000000001s)]
*  By the way, as a personal favorite, 100% [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7361.42s)]
*  As a human being, he's one of my favorite people [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7364.3s)]
*  that I've ever met. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7366.38s)]
*  He's an extraordinary human being. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7367.22s)]
*  So funny. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7368.92s)]
*  But when he fought Sean Strickland, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7369.76s)]
*  I have to be neutral. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7371.04s)]
*  I have to be like, wow, what's happening? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7373.04s)]
*  That's the job. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7374.88s)]
*  You can't be like that. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7375.72s)]
*  It's the job. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7376.54s)]
*  But that was during Fight Companion. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7377.38s)]
*  That was during Fight Companion. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7379.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, right. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7381.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I wasn't even working. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7382.34s)]
*  I was just hanging out here watching the fight. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7383.96s)]
*  I still have to be neutral. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7386.28s)]
*  I have to be. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7387.68s)]
*  I have to have a neutral mindset [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7388.52s)]
*  when I'm watching people fight. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7390.08s)]
*  Can you just be a fan? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7391.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7392.16s)]
*  When people are fighting, that's just like, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7393.0s)]
*  from my own mind, I don't allow my mind [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7394.660000000001s)]
*  to go into this avenue where I want someone to win [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7397.660000000001s)]
*  and someone to lose, [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7401.18s)]
*  because you'll get a biased perspective. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7402.02s)]
*  And I know I've been guilty of that in the past [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7403.46s)]
*  when I was in the early days of my commentary. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7406.660000000001s)]
*  And I realized that's a flaw. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7408.820000000001s)]
*  It's a flaw. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7410.76s)]
*  I have friends that fight, and I love them to death, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7413.18s)]
*  and I want them to win. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7415.62s)]
*  But if they don't win, I can't be attached to that. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7416.740000000001s)]
*  I have to be attached as a person [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7420.3s)]
*  who's appreciating the sport. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7422.18s)]
*  I'll check in on them. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7423.82s)]
*  How you doing? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7424.88s)]
*  You all right? [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7425.719999999999s)]
*  But the reality of what they're doing is [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7426.84s)]
*  I have to be a clear, objective viewer of the transaction. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7429.92s)]
*  Who's winning the exchange? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7435.84s)]
*  When I'm hearing MMA commentary, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7437.36s)]
*  I definitely want what you're saying. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7438.84s)]
*  When I hear football or sports commentary, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7440.2s)]
*  I wanna hear the Yankees brawl. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7442.5199999999995s)]
*  I wanna hear them go, come on! [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7443.84s)]
*  You can't let that out. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7445.44s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing is there's a giant difference [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7446.5599999999995s)]
*  between a sport and a fight. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7449.0s)]
*  A fight, you're exposing a man's soul, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7451.42s)]
*  and you gotta be respectful of that. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7453.9400000000005s)]
*  You're exposing everything about what he's capable of. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7455.900000000001s)]
*  They're fighting to the death. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7462.38s)]
*  They're just not letting them finish it. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7463.820000000001s)]
*  That's what that is. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7465.820000000001s)]
*  That's true, that's true. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7466.66s)]
*  I think, by the way, that Kirk Herbstreet does that so well. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7467.5s)]
*  He's an Ohio State graduate. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7471.26s)]
*  He played there, and he commentates [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7473.42s)]
*  on all the biggest games. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7475.38s)]
*  And he can commentate on an Ohio State game. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7476.22s)]
*  Be neutral? [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7478.26s)]
*  In my opinion, yes. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7479.24s)]

*  And you see Robbie Lawler going, what? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7587.28s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7590.8s)]
*  And when we thought Nick could beat him, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7591.639999999999s)]
*  we knew Nick was a jujitsu guy, [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7594.84s)]
*  but he beat him with boxing. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7596.84s)]
*  He knocked him out. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7598.98s)]
*  He knocked out Robbie Lawler. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7599.82s)]
*  When he hit him with the right hook [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7600.639999999999s)]
*  and Robbie dropped faceplants, we were like, what? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7601.5s)]
*  It was nonsense, no way. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7604.78s)]
*  Somebody bullied ruthless Robbie Lawler. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7607.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7611.58s)]

*  Robbie was throwing back, but Nick was just. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7614.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, he's talking shit. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7616.66s)]
*  You gotta understand that that talking shit [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7618.46s)]
*  is a 100% legit psychological tactic. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7621.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7625.78s)]
*  It talks with your mind and impedes your performance 100%. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7626.62s)]
*  It's a brilliant move. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7630.04s)]
*  It's in all sports too, in all high level sports. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7630.88s)]
*  It is, and in fighting, I think he did it better [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7633.44s)]
*  than anybody in the beginning. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7636.88s)]
*  Nobody did it better in fight. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7638.32s)]
*  He would talk so much shit to them. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7640.12s)]
*  Frank Shamrock said that he couldn't believe [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7641.599999999999s)]
*  it was happening to him. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7643.94s)]
*  Because when Nick, go to Nick Diaz versus Frank Shamrock. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7645.599999999999s)]

*  He stunned him with the one too, yeah, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7655.64s)]
*  Nick was better. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7657.339999999999s)]
*  All due respect to Nate. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7658.86s)]
*  Nate will tell you that Nick is better than Nate. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7660.139999999999s)]
*  Nick was. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7662.139999999999s)]
*  Just weed killed Nate. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7662.98s)]
*  Nick was one of the. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7663.799999999999s)]
*  No, man. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7664.639999999999s)]
*  I thought he stopped fighting [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7665.48s)]
*  because he wouldn't get tested. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7666.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7667.139999999999s)]
*  Nobody got killed because of weed. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7668.98s)]
*  I thought he stopped fighting [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7670.74s)]
*  because he was like, I'm not cleaning up. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7671.58s)]
*  Nick? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7672.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7673.379999999999s)]
*  No, no, there's no testing now in the UFC. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7674.2s)]
*  Now? [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7676.54s)]
*  He's just had some real injuries, man. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7677.379999999999s)]

*  When he fought Gomi and Pride, he was still great. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7696.48s)]
*  In Strikeforce, an elite athlete in combat sports [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7699.0s)]
*  has a small window of time [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7703.04s)]
*  where they can perform at their best level. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7705.04s)]

*  And if you went to the ground, [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7715.34s)]
*  he would fucking strangle you 100% of the time. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7716.34s)]
*  He beat everybody's asses. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7719.02s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7721.860000000001s)]
*  The thing is, like, he would let guys take him down [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7723.3s)]
*  and like, shut up, you can't knock me out. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7725.62s)]
*  Like, you never knocked him out. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7727.9400000000005s)]
*  No one knocked him out. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7729.18s)]
*  He always survived. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7730.18s)]
*  He always figured out a way to turn into a grappling exchange [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7731.56s)]
*  and then slowly but surely, he would beat you out. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7734.5s)]
*  Nick Diaz swam from Alcatraz. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7738.820000000001s)]
*  That's a gangster thing. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7741.96s)]

*  Might be more. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7749.919999999999s)]
*  Nick, I'm sorry if it's more since then. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7750.759999999999s)]
*  It's probably more since then. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7752.639999999999s)]
*  He beat everybody down. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7754.12s)]
*  Beat everybody down. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7755.839999999999s)]
*  Eventually, you just withered and he never got tired [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7757.0s)]
*  and he just kept putting it on you. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7759.839999999999s)]
*  And at the end of the fight, he was always like this. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7761.639999999999s)]
*  He was basically hitting a fucking punching bag. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7763.759999999999s)]
*  A person who couldn't believe the amount of pressure [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7766.08s)]
*  that Nick Diaz put on them. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7768.7s)]
*  Just beating the fuck out of them [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7770.26s)]
*  with not even breathing heavy. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7772.139999999999s)]
*  He did not stop. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7774.3s)]
*  And just standing on top of them like, what? [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7775.5s)]
*  That's it, that's over. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7777.32s)]
*  I want you to go to Nick Diaz versus Frank Shamrock. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7778.66s)]
*  Because Frank Shamrock was a legend. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7782.2s)]
*  Hardcore. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7784.94s)]
*  He was a UFC champion. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7785.78s)]
*  He was the first complete mixed martial artist. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7787.26s)]
*  He could wrestle, he could submit you, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7790.26s)]
*  he could do anything. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7792.219999999999s)]
*  And Nick Diaz the entire time was like, what bitch? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7793.58s)]
*  What bitch? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7796.3s)]
*  What are you gonna do, bitch? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7797.139999999999s)]
*  He was just constantly talking to him. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7797.96s)]
*  And Frank was like, I couldn't believe he was talking to me. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7799.52s)]
*  He's talking right now. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7803.6s)]
*  Always. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7804.96s)]
*  Give me some volume, see if you can hear it. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7807.4s)]
*  Lumberjacks, I think he's tremendous for the sport. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7809.4s)]
*  You need these kinds of characters in mixed martial arts. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7812.2s)]
*  I think they both like talking. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7816.0s)]
*  Frank's trying to focus right now though, you can tell. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7817.84s)]
*  Frank using that straight right hand to the body. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7820.68s)]
*  And the thing is, he's just touching you. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7822.84s)]
*  He's hitting you with like 50%, 60%. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7825.5s)]
*  But he's so relaxed. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7830.54s)]
*  Look how relaxed his style is. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7832.66s)]
*  He's not getting tired. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7835.339999999999s)]
*  Look how easy he's hitting him. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7836.78s)]
*  Why? [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7838.459999999999s)]
*  Because he's just wearing him out. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7839.299999999999s)]
*  He's cooking his food. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7841.299999999999s)]
*  And he's holding back. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7843.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7845.099999999999s)]
*  Oh no, Nick is 100% holding back. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7845.94s)]
*  Look how he's punching him. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7848.0199999999995s)]
*  He's not punching him full force at all. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7849.299999999999s)]
*  He's just piecing him up. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7851.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7853.54s)]
*  So the thing is, if you can fight at that style, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7854.8s)]
*  where you're just 50%ing guys, you don't get tired. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7858.599999999999s)]
*  And if you can do 20 punches at 50%, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7861.679999999999s)]
*  it's almost as good as 50 punches at 100%. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7865.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7868.719999999999s)]
*  Or rather 10 punches at 100%. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7869.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like if you cut it in half. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7872.0s)]
*  The volume also keeps you from being able [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7874.28s)]
*  to take a good breath. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7877.2s)]
*  Oh right. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7878.28s)]
*  The guy's on you all the time. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7879.12s)]
*  You never get a breather. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7880.4s)]
*  Frank's not getting any breathers. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7881.46s)]
*  And Nick's not tired. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7883.12s)]
*  Look, he's just piecing him. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7885.58s)]
*  Look, even that kick, there's no real power in it. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7886.42s)]
*  Everything is just touching you, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7888.58s)]
*  touch you until he starts to really see you wilt. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7890.18s)]
*  And look at him. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7893.66s)]
*  Oh. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7894.5s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7895.34s)]
*  Look at his stomach. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7896.16s)]
*  Look at his stomach. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7897.0s)]
*  There's no breathing heavy at all. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7897.84s)]
*  He's probably at 120 beats a minute right now. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7900.42s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7903.58s)]
*  This is a fucking guy who runs triathlons. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7904.42s)]
*  So he can stand in front of you and you are fucking cooked. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7907.26s)]
*  So he's cooking his chicken right now. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7911.12s)]
*  He's got his chicken on the frying pan right now. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7913.160000000001s)]
*  God damn. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7915.12s)]
*  He's cooking chicken breasts. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7915.96s)]
*  He's just piecing him up. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7918.84s)]
*  And look, not tired, not exhausted, not hitting him. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7920.320000000001s)]
*  There's a dig. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7923.88s)]
*  That's a dig. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7924.8s)]
*  First dig. Wow, wow. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7925.64s)]
*  That right hand of the body he dug into. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7926.6s)]
*  So right now he's 100% going after it. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7928.72s)]
*  Yeah, now he's going after it. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7930.280000000001s)]
*  See the difference? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7931.68s)]
*  Look, these punches have a lot more fury behind them, right? [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7932.64s)]
*  Because he's ending the fight. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7935.52s)]
*  Frank's already at 180 beats a minute. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7937.92s)]
*  He's wilting and he's beating the fuck out of him. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7940.740000000001s)]
*  And then he helps him out. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7943.9800000000005s)]
*  He goes, you're a legend, get up. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7944.820000000001s)]
*  He said that, you're a legend, get up. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7947.9400000000005s)]
*  And he holds his hand up. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7950.860000000001s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7952.66s)]
*  That's how he feels about him. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7953.5s)]
*  That's legitimately how he feels about him. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7954.46s)]
*  Is there anyone better than Diaz Brothers? [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7957.38s)]
*  Yeah. Brothers. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7959.7s)]
*  No, the Brothers, man. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7960.62s)]
*  That legend. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7962.26s)]
*  Look, look, there's a lot of awesome. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7963.1s)]
*  Are they better than Peyton Manning and Archie Manning? [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7965.1s)]
*  Or those? Eli Manning. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7967.22s)]
*  Yeah, Eli Manning? [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7968.22s)]
*  All sports are saying. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7969.64s)]
*  Yeah, like the Brothers. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7970.84s)]
*  No, Peyton and Eli are better. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7972.12s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7974.92s)]
*  World titles. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7975.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7976.72s)]
*  MVP's. Multiple rings. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7977.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7978.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7979.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7980.12s)]
*  Conor McGregor, you beat Conor McGregor. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7980.96s)]
*  That's his big win. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7982.6s)]
*  You said though that elite guys, when they get in there, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7983.6s)]
*  they go to the, they do most of the fight [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7987.72s)]
*  at like 60, 70%, right? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7989.92s)]
*  Unless, like, that's one of the reasons why [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7991.56s)]
*  Max Holloway stopped sparring. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7993.320000000001s)]
*  Max decided at one point in time that he's parted enough [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7996.04s)]
*  and he understands it and just does drills and trains [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=7999.280000000001s)]
*  and does a bunch of strength and conditioning work. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8001.72s)]
*  And when he goes into a fight, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8005.320000000001s)]
*  he hasn't been hit in a long time. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8006.84s)]
*  And that's his philosophy. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8009.400000000001s)]
*  But he's also a world champion at the top of, [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8010.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, there's a top five pound for pound, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8013.88s)]
*  Max Holloway should be in there. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8015.88s)]
*  He's one of the greatest of all time. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8017.64s)]
*  That's the thing, like, if you're amateur, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8019.200000000001s)]
*  you always start going like, I'm going 100%, dude. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8021.72s)]
*  Like, you know, you step in, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8024.62s)]
*  whether you're doing jujitsu or you're boxing or something, [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8026.179999999999s)]
*  you're just like, I'm gonna go all out. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8028.86s)]
*  And then you realize this is not sustainable. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8030.219999999999s)]
*  It's not sustainable. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8032.5s)]

*  Nick Diaz was the best at that. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8037.0599999999995s)]
*  Because he understood endurance from the perspective [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8038.62s)]
*  of someone who swam from Alcatraz, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8040.74s)]
*  someone who does triathlons. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8042.9s)]

*  you're running, and you're biking. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8047.86s)]

*  All of them are exhausting. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8050.58s)]

*  No, no, no, no, they do that specifically. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8062.24s)]
*  Endurance athletes do it. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8065.719999999999s)]
*  They swim back from Alcatraz. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8067.0s)]
*  Because if you don't make it to the shore, you're dead. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8068.5199999999995s)]

*  What are you doing? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8081.86s)]
*  So there's like a follow boat? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8082.7s)]
*  I don't even know how they did it. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8084.259999999999s)]
*  Is that what they did? [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8085.54s)]
*  Okay. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8086.94s)]

*  Not that a follow boat's gonna help you. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8091.299999999999s)]
*  How far are you swimming when you do that? [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8093.219999999999s)]
*  I just was there, it's too far. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8094.98s)]
*  It's more than a mile. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8095.98s)]

*  Current, though. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8099.299999999999s)]

*  They don't go with like, in an outgoing tide. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8103.099999999999s)]
*  Just the distance as the crow flies. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8105.46s)]

*  So during the Conor McGregor, Rafael Dos Anjos, [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8117.599999999999s)]
*  anyway, during one of the fights. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8120.96s)]
*  I said that he did it twice, and he corrected me. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8123.0s)]
*  He corrected me, he said he did it five times. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8125.44s)]
*  How far is the distance? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8127.2s)]
*  But this is, by the way, 2016. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8128.04s)]
*  He's probably done it five times since then. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8130.48s)]
*  Of course. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8133.12s)]

*  And he found out that his son had been molested [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8189.959999999999s)]
*  by a daycare worker, and he went after that guy [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8192.76s)]
*  and drove his car in a rage and shot a gun at him. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8196.220000000001s)]

*  for a long time, and they finally let him out on bond, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8203.78s)]
*  and now he's coaching at AKA. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8207.42s)]

*  You have to have a pharmaceutical gigantic company [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8592.339999999998s)]
*  that's been bribing politicians and manipulating narratives [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8596.279999999999s)]
*  and shaping the public's view of pharmaceutical drugs [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8600.92s)]
*  by hiding negative side effects [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8604.74s)]
*  and accentuating the positive benefits of it. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8606.88s)]
*  All for money. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8609.78s)]
*  But also all the lawyers, all the secretaries, [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8611.42s)]
*  everybody there. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8613.26s)]
*  But this is the environment that you grow up in. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8614.1s)]
*  You're a different thing. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8615.88s)]
*  It would be hard. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8617.08s)]
*  You're a different thing. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8617.92s)]
*  You right now would pass up on the money. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8618.76s)]
*  100%. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8622.02s)]
*  I have money right now, but I'm saying. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8622.86s)]
*  No, I'm saying if you got a fucking phone call [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8625.44s)]
*  and the Sackler said, this is gonna sound crazy. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8628.38s)]
*  But it turns out you're a part of the fucking Sackler family. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8631.88s)]
*  And you have a seat on the board [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8635.32s)]
*  and you can come in and you're a part. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8638.44s)]
*  We didn't know, but you're a part of the family [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8641.58s)]
*  and we have to give you a piece [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8643.34s)]
*  and you gotta come in, you're worth $10 billion now. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8644.66s)]
*  No, that's different. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8647.0s)]
*  That's inheriting it. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8647.84s)]
*  What if you're a comedy? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8648.76s)]
*  What if something you do now you realize. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8649.619999999999s)]
*  No, but the Sackler family inherited their wealth already. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8650.94s)]
*  That's why this is valid. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8653.48s)]
*  He didn't. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8654.56s)]
*  He built up his life. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8655.46s)]
*  That's why he wouldn't do it now. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8656.76s)]
*  You would do it if you were trapped in that environment. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8659.44s)]
*  That's what determinism is. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8663.24s)]
*  The idea behind it is you're shaped [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8664.52s)]
*  by all the different circumstances you encounter. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8666.4s)]
*  And to compare your circumstances [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8669.56s)]
*  to another circumstances are crazy. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8672.2s)]
*  They don't make any sense. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8674.6s)]
*  But I'm wondering, just argument's sake, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8675.6s)]
*  if they had said to me at a young age, [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8680.04s)]
*  yo, get out of comedy. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8683.64s)]
*  The Sacklers have this thing called Oxycontin. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8684.84s)]
*  It's really helping with cancer. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8689.78s)]
*  Because that's how you get into it, right? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8691.7s)]
*  For sure you would have got out at an early age. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8693.900000000001s)]
*  It's like if somebody gave you a lottery ticket. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8696.58s)]
*  If you got a lottery ticket and you won $100 million. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8699.140000000001s)]
*  I've thought about this all the time, all the world. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8703.18s)]
*  It would probably ruin your career when you were 21. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8705.02s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8706.7s)]
*  100%. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8707.54s)]
*  Oh yeah, at 21 it would've. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8708.380000000001s)]
*  But you wouldn't have gotten out of it. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8710.34s)]
*  You would've taken it. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8711.5s)]
*  No. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8712.34s)]
*  It would've ruined your career. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8713.18s)]
*  You would've taken the money and you would've become a loser. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8714.0s)]
*  No, I'm saying you wouldn't have gotten out of the money. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8715.740000000002s)]
*  You would've taken the money. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8717.140000000001s)]
*  No, you would've taken the money. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8717.980000000001s)]
*  If you don't have any money, when you get money, [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8719.32s)]
*  it is the panacea. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8721.6s)]
*  It is the elixir. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8723.4s)]
*  It is the thing that exists that you didn't think [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8724.84s)]
*  was possible. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8726.84s)]
*  Now all of a sudden you're not worrying about bills. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8727.88s)]
*  Which is 35% of everybody's fucking stress. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8730.36s)]
*  Those wardens, those prisons, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8732.96s)]
*  they're convincing themselves, no no, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8734.8s)]
*  these are dangerous drug addicts. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8736.72s)]
*  We can't have them on the street. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8738.199999999999s)]
*  They're convincing themselves. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8739.34s)]
*  They're not lying. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8740.32s)]
*  They're like lying to themselves. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8741.16s)]
*  Yeah, but you don't even have to convince yourself, man. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8742.0s)]
*  That's a human dynamic that was exposed [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8743.72s)]
*  in the Stanford prison experiments. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8745.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8747.64s)]
*  If you get people and they have power over other people, [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8749.26s)]
*  they start abusing them almost instantly. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8751.34s)]
*  You have to have a very... [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8754.5s)]
*  Especially if somebody tells you to do it. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8755.9s)]
*  Oh, I understand. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8758.18s)]
*  Those Stanford experiments are all the same. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8759.019999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, it's like... [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8760.42s)]
*  No, they're not totally debunked, Ari. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8761.82s)]
*  At the end of it, these people decided [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8763.779999999999s)]
*  that they wanted to get out of it and they got out of it. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8765.9s)]
*  But the reality is, the way they behaved with each other [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8767.9s)]
*  was documented. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8772.5s)]
*  It was like leading them. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8774.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you couldn't lead me to do that. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8775.800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8779.800000000001s)]
*  See, that's my problem. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8780.640000000001s)]
*  You couldn't right now. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8781.800000000001s)]
*  But you could if I was 20. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8783.2s)]
*  It was like they weren't really convinced. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8785.28s)]
*  And they were like, push hard or go. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8786.640000000001s)]
*  And it's like, okay. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8788.44s)]
*  They weren't convinced they were actually doing it. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8789.28s)]
*  There's been a lot of weird things about people in power. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8790.480000000001s)]
*  And one of the weirdest ones is there was people [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8793.560000000001s)]
*  that were administrating electrical shock to a person. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8798.68s)]
*  And they were told to do it by someone else, [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8804.54s)]
*  so they did it. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8808.460000000001s)]
*  And it got to the point where they thought [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8809.78s)]
*  the person might be dying. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8811.62s)]
*  And some people kept doing it. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8813.220000000001s)]
*  And some people did not. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8815.18s)]
*  And there is a power dynamic that I think allows people [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8817.82s)]
*  to torture people. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8823.82s)]
*  It allows people to kill people, [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8825.460000000001s)]
*  whether they're, whatever the fuck you are. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8827.54s)]
*  If you're an Israeli, a Palestinian, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8829.84s)]
*  if you're a Palestinian, Israeli. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8831.58s)]
*  You can kill someone, they're not even a human, [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8833.68s)]
*  that is the other. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8835.48s)]
*  There's a fucking programming that exists in our mind [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8836.84s)]
*  because of all the tribal warfare human beings [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8840.18s)]
*  have gone through over hundreds of thousands of years. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8842.56s)]
*  When the time we were prehistoric humans, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8845.48s)]
*  time we were fucking modern humans, [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8847.76s)]
*  we have been killing each other for so fucking long [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8849.56s)]
*  that we have a program in us where it's easy [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8853.6s)]
*  to other people. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8856.24s)]
*  That's how the Holocaust happened. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8857.08s)]
*  That's how what's happening in Ukraine is happening. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8858.76s)]
*  What's happening in Israel is happening. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8860.86s)]
*  You can decide that someone is something [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8862.220000000001s)]
*  other than a human being. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8864.78s)]
*  And they can get you to do that pretty fucking quickly. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8866.26s)]
*  If they tap into that mindset, they tap into that programming, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8869.7s)]
*  they can give you a button, they go, hit him. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8873.02s)]
*  But he said he's dying, hit him. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8875.5s)]
*  Hit him. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8877.66s)]
*  And they would hear them scream. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8878.5s)]
*  They would have them scream. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8879.78s)]
*  I have to say, I say this with love. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8881.7s)]
*  Tom's dad was in the Vietnam War. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8885.04s)]
*  I don't think Tom's dad was a guy [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8887.78s)]
*  that wanted to ever kill anyone, [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8889.460000000001s)]
*  but he had to in that programming. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8891.44s)]
*  The thing I think is there's a disconnect [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8894.16s)]
*  with where we as Americans look at things on social media [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8896.28s)]
*  and we think we're not that Karen, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8898.84s)]
*  we're not that person, we'd never do it. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8900.42s)]
*  But until you're in that moment, you don't know. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8902.36s)]
*  You really don't know. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8904.52s)]
*  There's a lot of normal GIs in Vietnam [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8905.36s)]
*  that were raping fucking villagers. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8907.08s)]
*  Probably. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8909.960000000001s)]
*  They didn't go in as monsters. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8910.8s)]
*  Bro, they, war does something. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8912.24s)]
*  There's so many war crimes. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8914.6s)]
*  If you can't connect to the fact that that's in you, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8916.84s)]
*  that's in you, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8919.84s)]
*  then I think you're lying to yourself. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8920.82s)]
*  Yeah, it's a possibility. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8921.66s)]
*  You don't know. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8922.5s)]
*  That fucking rogue is good. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8923.34s)]
*  When you go into that, when you show up, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8924.16s)]
*  you don't just go, well, the training, [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8927.1s)]
*  you do get trained to be a killer. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8930.14s)]
*  That whole speech of like, they are training you [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8933.300000000001s)]
*  to see the enemy as the enemy [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8937.02s)]
*  and somebody that you have to kill. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8939.58s)]
*  So it's not day one. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8941.86s)]
*  You're prepared over a series of months. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8944.2s)]
*  And it's a version of a brainwashing. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8947.460000000001s)]
*  They brainwash you to become a killer. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8949.279999999999s)]
*  I'm like, this is good. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8950.92s)]
*  Do it. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8951.88s)]
*  But there's a pattern that you can follow in your head [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8952.72s)]
*  where you can destroy another human being. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8954.76s)]
*  1000%. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8956.679999999998s)]
*  And that's what Customato taught Mike Tyson. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8957.519999999999s)]
*  He taught Mike Tyson that through hypnosis. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8960.88s)]
*  He taught him the most effective way [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8963.359999999999s)]
*  to think and to view you don't exist. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8966.0s)]
*  He was telling him you're just, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8969.96s)]
*  the task is the only thing that's important. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8971.22s)]
*  You don't exist. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8973.199999999999s)]
*  You don't exist, wow. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8975.119999999999s)]
*  Just the task of smashing this person [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8975.96s)]
*  is all that it is. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8978.28s)]
*  And if you can think like that, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8979.86s)]
*  that alleviates so much brain power. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8980.900000000001s)]
*  It alleviates the guilt. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8984.18s)]
*  And if you can tell that to a soldier, [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8985.18s)]
*  you can get them to do some wild shit. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8987.060000000001s)]
*  And they did. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8989.1s)]
*  And they do. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8989.94s)]
*  Your dad talked to you about that. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8990.78s)]
*  Yeah, in later years, yeah. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8993.140000000001s)]
*  I'm curious, I would love to hear [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8995.060000000001s)]
*  the insight your dad had about that. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8997.300000000001s)]
*  As a son, hearing a dad going like, [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=8999.62s)]
*  yeah, I just had to kill people. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9002.7s)]
*  My dad's never killed anyone. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9004.94s)]
*  But he had asthma. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9006.84s)]
*  But I'm curious, because we're talking about this. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9010.400000000001s)]
*  What was that, as a son, hearing the rationale, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9014.92s)]
*  you have to accept it, you have to figure it out. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9017.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and he was a great dad. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9019.640000000001s)]
*  He was a really kind, loving guy. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9020.800000000001s)]
*  But I mean, first of all, he loved the Marine Corps. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9022.400000000001s)]
*  He loved the Marine Corps. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9026.400000000001s)]
*  Well, imagine the bonds you make [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9028.460000000001s)]
*  when you're literally fighting for life and death. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9030.42s)]
*  Yeah, and he's a lieutenant. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9032.52s)]
*  So he has a platoon of 70 men under his command. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9035.78s)]
*  So you feel also the responsibility. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9038.98s)]
*  And he told me right before he died, [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9042.66s)]
*  in the last year of his life, [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9045.98s)]
*  that he thought about the men who died in his platoon [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9047.18s)]
*  every day, and he'd never told me that before. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9050.42s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9052.380000000001s)]
*  He goes, every day, I think about those guys that I lost. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9053.66s)]
*  And I was like, because I had no idea. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9057.380000000001s)]
*  He never spoke about it. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9059.18s)]
*  And he would tell me stories about different guys [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9060.880000000001s)]
*  dying next to him, stepping on a mine next to him, [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9063.94s)]
*  exploding three feet from him, getting shot. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9067.58s)]
*  The worst one, he said, was a guy that, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9072.06s)]
*  to watch movies back then, you'd have to go to a base, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9074.38s)]
*  get a film canister, and bring it back. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9078.98s)]
*  And in a monsoon season, one of those guys went to get films [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9082.06s)]
*  just for entertainment, and he drowned [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9084.78s)]
*  in a monsoon on the way back. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9087.5s)]
*  What? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9088.94s)]
*  So it felt like a more meaningless death. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9089.78s)]
*  It wasn't in combat, things like that. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9093.48s)]
*  He would talk about that. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9095.64s)]
*  And then, also, they do get this disconnect [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9096.64s)]
*  if you're in combat. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9102.08s)]
*  It's not like you're talking about, could you kill someone? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9105.119999999999s)]
*  It's like, you're in a world of killing. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9107.98s)]
*  That's all that's happening around you. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9112.439999999999s)]
*  It's not could you, you have to. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9113.599999999999s)]
*  You have to. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9115.0s)]
*  And so, then he was just like, yeah. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9115.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's when he started telling me. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9118.039999999999s)]
*  So I asked him as a kid, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9119.64s)]
*  I ended up doing a bit about it, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9120.599999999999s)]
*  but I used to ask him as a kid, [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9122.22s)]
*  because you see wars, and you see movies, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9124.22s)]
*  and you're like, did you do that? [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9129.42s)]
*  And as a kid, you're not gonna tell the kids. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9130.26s)]
*  He was like, no, it didn't work like that. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9132.1s)]
*  I was in charge. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9133.98s)]
*  I was a lieutenant. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9135.38s)]
*  And then later years, he's like, [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9137.12s)]
*  well, I threw grenades into bunkers. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9140.02s)]
*  I was like, were there people in the bunkers? [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9141.98s)]
*  He was like, yeah. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9143.74s)]
*  All those Y-Ways grenades. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9144.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9145.82s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9146.86s)]
*  And then he also said, I mean, it became like this joke, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9148.02s)]
*  but it was true. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9151.560000000001s)]
*  He said, there's no better feeling [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9152.400000000001s)]
*  than killing the enemy, right? [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9154.560000000001s)]
*  Like in combat, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9156.04s)]
*  because they're all trying to kill the people around you, [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9157.92s)]
*  and they are killing people around you. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9159.400000000001s)]
*  So yeah, he said they would pull bodies out of these holes. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9161.240000000002s)]
*  The Vietnamese are small people, stature-wise, [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9166.240000000002s)]
*  so they would hide in holes a lot of times, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9169.54s)]
*  like holes in the ground. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9171.480000000001s)]
*  Coochie tunnels. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9172.44s)]
*  And they would throw grenades into there, [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9173.28s)]
*  and then when they'd pull them out, they'd be in half. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9175.320000000002s)]
*  So they'd pull like a torso out. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9177.580000000002s)]
*  You know? [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9179.78s)]
*  But he also said, you know, [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9182.34s)]
*  losing men left and right, like in your platoon, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9184.5s)]
*  I mean, it's devastating to you. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9187.460000000001s)]
*  Except the person you bonded with in basic training. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9188.66s)]
*  You're over there for a lie. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9191.94s)]
*  I think that's a part that they don't, [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9194.94s)]
*  a lot of people don't ever reconcile with if they're. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9196.66s)]
*  That's gotta be the hardest. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9200.18s)]
*  You're over there committing atrocities for a lie. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9201.86s)]

*  and then we had sex, and she was like. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9467.84s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9469.44s)]
*  She was like, hey, I love that idea. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9470.28s)]
*  Those angels are real. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9474.12s)]
*  It's cool. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9475.56s)]
*  I think if you stopped and thought about [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9477.52s)]
*  how many cultures believe in some greater power [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9481.14s)]
*  that's above everything that they intuitively know [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9485.88s)]
*  is guiding you in a moral and ethical direction, [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9488.64s)]
*  there's gotta be something to it. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9492.08s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9493.4s)]
*  There's something to it. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9494.24s)]
*  Suck my dick, Louis C.K., you're right. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9495.539999999999s)]
*  He can suck my dick. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9498.26s)]
*  He doesn't believe it. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9499.26s)]
*  Because he didn't believe in anything. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9500.66s)]
*  Well, that's a fair way to believe. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9502.34s)]
*  No. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9504.22s)]
*  You wanna just do it based entirely on evidence. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9505.06s)]
*  That's a very reasonable perspective. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9506.5s)]
*  He's a total atheist. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9507.34s)]
*  Because he's like, you're just making up a reason it's this. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9508.46s)]
*  Yeah, but I like that more. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9510.9s)]
*  I like that more. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9512.3s)]
*  I think the universe is God. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9513.92s)]
*  That's what I think. Keep going. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9516.9s)]
*  I think this idea of God creating the universe is silly. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9517.94s)]
*  I think the whole thing is God. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9520.539999999999s)]
*  I think it's God in the fact that it's the entire creation [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9522.0s)]
*  of everything that exists that we can measure. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9525.96s)]
*  All of it is the universe. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9528.199999999999s)]
*  And if you read the Bible, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9530.039999999999s)]
*  the Bible talks about in the beginning there was light. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9532.08s)]
*  Boy, that sounds a lot like the Big Bang. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9534.52s)]
*  Boy, that sounds a lot like the birth of the universe. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9536.88s)]
*  I think these fucking people that wrote the Bible [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9539.08s)]
*  were recounting stories that were told down [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9541.52s)]
*  through people that had a scientific understanding [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9544.4s)]
*  of the birth and death of the universe, [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9546.279999999999s)]
*  just like we do now. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9547.6s)]
*  Maybe even more than we do now. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9548.96s)]
*  And then they got hit by asteroids. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9550.380000000001s)]
*  And then it was thousands of years [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9552.220000000001s)]
*  before civilization reestablished itself. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9553.980000000001s)]
*  And the stories had been handed down forever and ever. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9556.220000000001s)]
*  And by the time people wrote them down, they were goofy. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9560.34s)]
*  And they were goofy. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9563.060000000001s)]
*  And it was like, God created the earth in six days [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9564.02s)]
*  and the whole story of Adam and Eve. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9566.18s)]
*  And there's probably a lot to all of it that's true. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9567.5s)]
*  And it's probably a historical record [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9571.720000000001s)]
*  that was told to people that were essentially barbarians [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9574.82s)]
*  that were surviving from the collapse [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9578.76s)]
*  of a superior civilization, superior to what we have today. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9580.76s)]
*  And there's a lot of real physical evidence of that. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9585.16s)]
*  There's a lot of archeological evidence of that. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9587.199999999999s)]
*  And it seems to be a direction [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9589.24s)]
*  that a lot of people are headed into [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9590.92s)]
*  when they understand how often we get hit with asteroids. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9592.24s)]
*  Somewhere around 11,800 years ago, we got pelted [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9595.48s)]
*  and it stopped civilization in its tracks [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9599.199999999999s)]
*  and we had to rebuild from scratch. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9601.72s)]
*  And the people that survived were probably monsters. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9604.039999999999s)]
*  The Mongols and the fucking hordes and the barbarians. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9608.18s)]
*  They were the most harsh people [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9612.699999999999s)]
*  because that was the only way you survived [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9614.779999999999s)]
*  because there was no longer [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9616.34s)]
*  a technologically advanced civilization. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9618.22s)]
*  It was all just barbarism [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9620.619999999999s)]
*  and there's very few animals to eat [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9622.22s)]
*  because there's a nuclear winter [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9623.94s)]
*  because the sky is filled with the impact [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9625.66s)]
*  of this massive meteor that slams into earth [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9629.5s)]
*  and kills 70% of all the people. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9632.9s)]
*  And then about 6,000 years later, [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9636.8s)]
*  they start figuring out mathematics again. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9638.48s)]
*  Wow. [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9640.16s)]
*  This is why I started this podcast. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9641.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9642.8s)]
*  What do you think as a, you grew up religious. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9643.64s)]
*  What is your take on God? [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9646.44s)]
*  You gave up your Lord? [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9649.24s)]
*  Yeah, they said the years were different. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9650.8s)]
*  So when they said it was created 5,000 years ago, [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9653.76s)]
*  they're like, that's our understanding of the years. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9655.68s)]
*  They're like, this guy lived through 260, [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9658.039999999999s)]
*  but that's just, I don't know, some seasons past. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9661.279999999999s)]
*  When they wrote that, they didn't even have a son. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9663.6s)]
*  How old are you? [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9666.5s)]
*  I don't know, we don't have calendars. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9667.34s)]
*  But are you a believer in a higher power? [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9668.5s)]
*  No. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9670.460000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9671.300000000001s)]
*  Why? [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9672.12s)]
*  What do you mean why? [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9672.960000000001s)]
*  What happens when you die? [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9673.800000000001s)]
*  There's no why to a belief. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9674.64s)]
*  What happens when you die? [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9675.48s)]
*  When you die, I won't forget you. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9677.34s)]
*  No. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9678.94s)]
*  But when I die, I'll be remembering heralded. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9679.78s)]
*  You know I've worked really hard so that doesn't happen. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9681.58s)]
*  You know, that's one of my biggest things about working [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9684.06s)]
*  is I wonder, because they say you die twice. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9686.14s)]
*  You die when you die and then you die [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9690.06s)]
*  when the last person that remembers you dies. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9691.62s)]
*  I try to go to graveyards. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9693.42s)]
*  I try to look at the graveyards and see who they are [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9695.06s)]
*  and try to say their name and keep them alive a little longer. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9697.199999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9699.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9700.4s)]
*  That's creepy. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9701.22s)]
*  So there's no second death. [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9702.06s)]
*  Sometimes I call my dead friends [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9703.359999999999s)]
*  on their cell phone numbers. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9704.64s)]
*  Do they ever answer? [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9706.56s)]
*  Nope. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9707.4s)]
*  They never got that number again? [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9708.24s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9709.34s)]
*  No, no. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9710.18s)]
*  I don't like the death thing. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9711.019999999999s)]
*  I don't believe in it, but I don't. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9713.72s)]
*  You don't believe in death? [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9715.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9715.88s)]
*  It's never happened to me. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9716.72s)]
*  I have one phone that I keep active [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9717.56s)]
*  because I have a text message chain from Anthony Bourdain [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9719.92s)]
*  and a voicemail from a buddy of mine who died. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9723.880000000001s)]
*  The pool player? [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9728.16s)]
*  No, Dave Dolan, my private investigator friend. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9729.12s)]
*  He was the funniest guy I ever met that never did stand up. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9733.24s)]
*  I was an amateur comic and he was a private investigator [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9736.92s)]
*  that lost his driver's license [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9740.640000000001s)]
*  because he was drunk driving. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9742.04s)]
*  So he needed an assistant. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9743.36s)]
*  And so he asked, we really just needed someone to drive him. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9744.880000000001s)]
*  And so I was like, private investigator's assistant. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9747.68s)]
*  That'd be a cool job. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9750.04s)]
*  So I just start working for this guy. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9750.880000000001s)]
*  He died a few years back when he left me a voicemail. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9753.58s)]
*  It was fucking awesome. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9756.539999999999s)]
*  What was the last text Anthony Bourdain sent you? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=9757.699999999999s)]

*  He's underrated. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10799.900000000001s)]
*  He's one of the best comics of our generation. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10800.74s)]
*  His heyday on Opie and Anthony. [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10803.1s)]
*  He made Opie and Anthony. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10805.300000000001s)]
*  He made. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10806.62s)]
*  That's an understatement right there. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10808.02s)]
*  He made it. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10809.34s)]
*  It was weird to me that it was Opie and Anthony [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10810.18s)]
*  and Jim was on it. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10811.900000000001s)]
*  I was like, it seems kinda weird. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10814.08s)]
*  I think they had their show for years before. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10814.92s)]
*  I know. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10816.4s)]
*  It wasn't what it was until Jim showed up. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10817.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10820.199999999999s)]
*  They were in Boston. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10821.039999999999s)]
*  They would never have had the comedians they had. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10821.88s)]
*  I mean, respectfully, I love Opie and Anthony. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10824.279999999999s)]
*  I love those guys. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10826.279999999999s)]
*  I was a fan of the show. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10827.119999999999s)]
*  But that group of comics that was on it, [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10828.279999999999s)]
*  the reason this podcast is what it is today, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10830.76s)]
*  in all fairness, is because of that fucking show, [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10833.56s)]
*  but it's also because of Jim. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10836.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's because that show gave people [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10838.92s)]
*  the opportunity to just hang out. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10840.84s)]
*  And I remember when Ari and I used to do it [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10842.460000000001s)]
*  in the early days, it was just like, [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10843.9s)]
*  this is a place where you could just hang out with comics. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10845.5s)]
*  There was no script. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10847.54s)]
*  There was no script. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10848.7s)]
*  They just allowed us to fuck around. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10849.54s)]
*  And also they were cool about, [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10850.54s)]
*  you were a headliner and a name, [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10851.74s)]
*  and they were like, who's this? [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10853.460000000001s)]
*  My opener is comic. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10854.980000000001s)]
*  Was comic gonna give them a like? [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10855.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I would tell them, I got a funny guy [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10856.82s)]
*  who's coming with me. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10859.460000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna bring him in. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10860.300000000001s)]
*  They'd be like, cool. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10861.12s)]
*  Tommy, Tommy was one of those guys. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10861.960000000001s)]
*  I bombed so hard on that show. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10862.800000000001s)]
*  Really? [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10864.62s)]
*  How'd you bomb? [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10865.460000000001s)]
*  I was totally not ready for it. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10866.28s)]
*  I was not a fan of the show. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10868.54s)]
*  Oh, you didn't know? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10870.62s)]
*  I knew about the show, but I didn't listen to it. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10872.199999999999s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10874.88s)]
*  Oh, no. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10875.72s)]
*  And I went in there and I was just, [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10876.539999999999s)]
*  I said a couple words and I just kinda sat in the pocket. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10878.56s)]
*  And then Ricky Gervais came in. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10881.56s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10883.6s)]
*  And then I started talking to Ricky [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10884.44s)]
*  as the show was going on. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10887.36s)]
*  Just like, hey, what's going on? [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10888.88s)]
*  Would you fly into it? [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10890.28s)]
*  I was like, I did that episode. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10891.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, no. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10892.24s)]
*  While the show was happening? [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10893.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10894.039999999999s)]
*  You didn't realize your mic was on? [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10894.88s)]
*  Kinda. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10896.28s)]
*  And then... [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10897.119999999999s)]
*  You just didn't get radio. [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10897.94s)]
*  And Ricky and I just kept talking. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10899.76s)]
*  And then I'd look over and I'd see the guys like, [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10900.86s)]
*  what are you fucking doing? [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10904.06s)]
*  You might be the most epically, in retrospect, [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10906.66s)]
*  horrific comic to ever do radio. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10909.62s)]
*  What? [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10911.78s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10913.380000000001s)]
*  Because Tom has never given a fuck about anything [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10914.22s)]
*  ever in his life, ever. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10916.42s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10917.9s)]
*  So when you did Tom, when you did Bob and Tom, [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10918.74s)]
*  they're like, write out your things, you wanna say it? [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10920.74s)]
*  Tom was like, I'll just figure it out. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10922.58s)]
*  Yeah, they never gave a fuck. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10925.18s)]
*  That one sucked. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10926.5s)]
*  You never gave a fuck. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10927.34s)]
*  They asked me to do that too. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10928.16s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not doing that. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10929.0s)]
*  The producers got really upset. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10929.84s)]
*  I got upset too. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10931.06s)]
*  They upset like... [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10931.9s)]
*  And I go, we're gonna figure it out. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10933.74s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't like it. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10935.66s)]
*  I'm not that kinda comic. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10936.5s)]
*  They didn't like it. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10937.32s)]
*  This is nonsense. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10938.16s)]
*  You're doing some 1985 nonsense. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10939.1s)]
*  They didn't like that at all. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10941.380000000001s)]
*  And this is not 1985, get outta here. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10942.22s)]
*  They were nice, but they were nice. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10944.54s)]
*  Tom was doing that before anyone else. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10945.380000000001s)]
*  Like, with absolute love, when you see all the comics [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10948.74s)]
*  coming on and fucking up radio and TV that they're doing now, [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10952.380000000001s)]
*  it's a little bit based on the fact that you really [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10956.6s)]
*  did not give a fuck. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10960.64s)]
*  Hang on. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10961.48s)]
*  A lot of guys didn't, including Tracy Morgan. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10962.3s)]
*  Tracy Morgan. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10965.0s)]
*  Tracy Morgan is better than anyone. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10965.84s)]
*  He was slapping Bunny out of his belly. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10967.52s)]
*  He was like, someone's getting pregnant. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10969.56s)]
*  Someone's getting pregnant. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10971.08s)]
*  He would be slapping his belly. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10972.56s)]
*  That's my main call. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10973.76s)]
*  My philosophy on it was basically, [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10974.8s)]
*  I think podcasts, radio, television, [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10978.119999999999s)]
*  all can go really well based on the host's interest. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10981.68s)]
*  What I had was, I had a real personal fuck you to a host [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10986.019999999999s)]
*  that was like, I don't really care who you are [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10994.22s)]
*  or what you're doing here. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10997.14s)]
*  This is what we do. [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10998.619999999999s)]
*  And so if they were like, you're at the club this week? [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=10999.939999999999s)]
*  I would go, yeah. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11002.939999999999s)]
*  And then they were like, be funny. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11004.98s)]
*  I'd be like, why don't you go suck your fucking mom's dick. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11006.14s)]
*  And then they would go, what's happening? [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11011.14s)]
*  That's a business partner right there. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11012.699999999999s)]
*  So that's why you came out with DJ Dad Mouth. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11013.78s)]
*  That was why DJ Dad Mouth came out. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11016.68s)]
*  So it came out to this specific person? [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11018.52s)]
*  That came out just because I was like, [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11020.880000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna do this. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11022.480000000001s)]
*  Morning TV never did anything for a number of years. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11024.560000000001s)]
*  It never helped. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11026.28s)]
*  Only contractually obligated? [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11027.12s)]
*  They just make you. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11029.6s)]
*  So what they would end up doing is, [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11030.44s)]
*  the funny bones would go, hey, if you would do this, [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11032.1s)]
*  we bring people every week, [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11037.08s)]
*  no matter whether they're big or small, [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11038.76s)]
*  selling tickets or not. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11041.52s)]
*  So when I started to sell tickets, [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11042.640000000001s)]
*  they'd be like, oh, your shows are sold out this week. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11044.880000000001s)]
*  I'd be like, cool. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11047.0s)]
*  And you're doing Good Morning Hartford tomorrow. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11047.84s)]
*  And I'd be like, why? [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11049.44s)]
*  And they're like, because we do it every week. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11050.84s)]
*  And I'd go, but it's not to sell tickets, right? [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11053.160000000002s)]
*  Because the tickets are sold? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11055.880000000001s)]
*  It's just to promote the club. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11056.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so they're like, no, but get up at five and go do it. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11058.08s)]
*  And I'm like, all right. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11061.2s)]
*  So that kind of came from that. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11062.92s)]
*  But before that, I'm saying, [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11064.12s)]
*  even like I did Kimmel last night, [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11066.92s)]
*  when you go there, you're like, all right, [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11069.6s)]
*  you do a pre-interview with a producer, [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11072.66s)]
*  it still rides on the fact that he's engaged [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11074.3s)]
*  and wants it to go well, right? [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11077.14s)]
*  And he totally was, and it was really fun, [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11079.94s)]
*  and it went well. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11082.02s)]
*  But in the radio days, a lot of times those radio hosts, [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11083.46s)]
*  sometimes there's like the Philly guys, [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11087.66s)]
*  Preston and Steve. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11090.02s)]
*  Preston and Steve, they're old. [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11090.86s)]
*  They come in, like you come in, [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11092.539999999999s)]
*  and they're like, they know questions, [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11093.84s)]
*  they know what you've been doing. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11096.6s)]
*  So that makes the experience fun. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11097.82s)]
*  They're fun, they're happy to see you. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11099.42s)]
*  But you go into places where they're just like, [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11101.06s)]
*  they're literally like, you're born in Cincinnati? [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11103.6s)]
*  And you go, yeah. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11105.48s)]
*  And they'll go. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11107.4s)]
*  Trying to lead you. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11108.88s)]
*  Yeah, so tell us something about that. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11109.72s)]
*  And you're like, what? [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11111.359999999999s)]
*  So I just didn't go. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11112.88s)]
*  It's in Ohio. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11115.68s)]
*  If I left that place and you, the host, were like, [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11116.68s)]
*  I didn't really like you, I'd be like, [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11119.8s)]
*  I don't give a shit that you don't like me. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11121.0s)]
*  I'm not here to fucking dance with you, man. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11122.8s)]
*  You have ridden that horse into the grave. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11124.08s)]
*  I love that about you, is that you gotta remember, [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11126.699999999999s)]
*  this was before, when you were doing that, [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11128.88s)]
*  the only white, no one white person was doing that. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11133.019999999999s)]
*  Tracy Morgan, as a famous person, [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11136.339999999998s)]
*  would go in and be wild on thing. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11137.779999999999s)]
*  And everyone would fucking love, we'd share with each other. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11140.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Tracy was the best. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11143.179999999998s)]
*  Tom was doing it in earnest. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11144.0s)]
*  It's like, fuck off. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11147.699999999999s)]
*  Everyone can find you, at the same time, [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11149.06s)]
*  I was going to the same places, and being like, [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11151.42s)]
*  oh God, please play a Tracy Morgan one. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11153.88s)]
*  Look at me on that, I'm pretty, I'm handsome. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11157.359999999999s)]
*  Now I can see why I got so many kids. [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11160.88s)]
*  Texas, I'm telling you, man, I went to Jaguars last night. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11163.679999999998s)]
*  I love the ladies here. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11166.679999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11167.679999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11168.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so again, not family entertainment necessarily. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11169.339999999998s)]
*  Somebody go get pregnant while I'm in town. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11171.16s)]
*  Two days, watch. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11173.599999999999s)]
*  Two days, somebody go get pregnant. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11175.359999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, Tracy. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11177.839999999998s)]
*  It's always these guys, you know, [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11179.599999999999s)]
*  it's the same guy in every market. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11181.08s)]
*  Oh boy. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11182.599999999999s)]
*  But they're loving it, they're loving it. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11183.439999999999s)]
*  And Tom would go in and do that, [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11184.96s)]
*  but he would do it his own way, you know? [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11186.939999999999s)]
*  And it was so fucking awesome, man. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11188.619999999999s)]
*  Because so many of us, myself included, [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11193.019999999999s)]
*  would just suck a dick and be like, [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11195.38s)]
*  when I was 22, I had a bottle of the Russian bottle. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11197.38s)]
*  No, I disagree. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11198.939999999999s)]
*  What you would do is you would go in with fun energy. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11200.419999999998s)]
*  You'd go in with a bottle of Jack and say let's go. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11203.58s)]
*  I would drink on those. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11205.82s)]

*  I'm doing stuff. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11224.76s)]
*  I was trying to move to London to let those bitches know. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11225.6s)]

*  Because I can't look at it. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11529.5s)]
*  It fucks me up. [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11530.800000000001s)]
*  So I just stopped looking at it. [[03:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11532.24s)]
*  I hired someone to do it for me. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11533.28s)]

*  I didn't get bullied, I had a big brother. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11695.22s)]
*  I think you're my big brother. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11697.34s)]
*  Aw, sweetie. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11699.019999999999s)]
*  I do, I feel like I have a big brother. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11699.859999999999s)]
*  I've said that to you and I've said that to you. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11701.98s)]
*  I think you guys approach things very differently. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11704.14s)]
*  We do. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11706.06s)]
*  I think I drive you fucking nuts. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11706.9s)]
*  No, you don't. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11708.84s)]
*  I have to, I have to. [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11709.68s)]
*  I know I drive you nuts. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11710.52s)]
*  He drove me nuts during Sober October. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11711.52s)]
*  You bring out his competitive spirit. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11713.32s)]
*  You bring that out. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11714.72s)]
*  But there's a fucking monster in there. [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11715.56s)]
*  You let him out of the cage. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11717.72s)]
*  But I love your monster. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11719.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11720.64s)]
*  Like the way a younger brother would like [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11721.48s)]
*  needling his big brother, I like your monster. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11723.44s)]
*  Here's the big, one of the big things, [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11726.199999999999s)]
*  I think it's super different, [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11727.84s)]
*  is that he approaches things of like, [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11729.279999999999s)]
*  all right, if I wanna be proficient at this thing, [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11732.7s)]
*  I'm gonna do it every day, [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11737.26s)]
*  because that's how you get good, [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11739.74s)]
*  the consistency and the discipline. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11740.74s)]
*  And you go, you know what? [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11742.9s)]
*  I think I can wing this shit. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11745.42s)]
*  I think we're good at it. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11746.74s)]
*  And that's one of the big philosophical differences [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11747.98s)]
*  of how you approach life. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11750.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11751.74s)]
*  But I listen to your podcasts all the time. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11753.220000000001s)]
*  And I love the way your brain thinks. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11755.9s)]
*  I would never listen to my podcast. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11758.74s)]
*  But I like the way your brain thinks. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11761.12s)]
*  I'm just curious. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11763.32s)]
*  That's the way my brain thinks. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11764.16s)]
*  I'm always just trying to figure out [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11765.08s)]
*  why I think what I think, [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11766.6s)]
*  and why this other person thinks what they think. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11768.48s)]
*  But I do that. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11770.64s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11771.48s)]
*  I do the same in a flip-flop. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11772.3s)]
*  Like I like the way your brain thinks, [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11774.48s)]
*  but it's not the way my brain thinks. [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11775.76s)]
*  I have no discipline. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11777.12s)]
*  I don't like discipline. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11778.2s)]
*  One of the cool things about hanging out [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11779.24s)]
*  with different walks of life, [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11780.72s)]
*  you obviously become very successful [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11781.56s)]
*  with claiming you have no discipline. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11783.64s)]
*  You do have some discipline, you don't. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11785.84s)]
*  You work out all the time. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11787.24s)]
*  You know what's secret time that I lean on you [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11789.08s)]
*  in times of real need. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11792.82s)]
*  Like when I was with my cardiologist, [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11794.1s)]
*  and I was like, hey man, I'm lost. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11796.619999999999s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11798.14s)]
*  And you were like, carnivore. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11799.02s)]
*  And so I do that. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11801.699999999999s)]
*  I do that. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11803.14s)]
*  The problem is, and I would say this honestly, [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11804.48s)]
*  just to Ari privately, but like, [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11807.34s)]
*  we knew you before you were you. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11812.06s)]
*  Like we knew you before this thing. [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11814.74s)]
*  So like I know you. [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11817.06s)]
*  And I know who you've become. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11819.82s)]
*  I obviously respect that. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11822.76s)]
*  I really do. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11824.24s)]
*  But like my Joe guy I knew is you. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11825.16s)]
*  Is you. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11830.76s)]
*  I don't think I've changed that much. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11832.52s)]
*  It's a perception of you that's changed. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11834.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11836.6s)]
*  And so everyone else falls into that [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11837.44s)]
*  with a lot of famous people. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11838.880000000001s)]
*  They fall into what they think of someone. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11839.84s)]
*  And so they don't get treated as who they really are. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11841.52s)]
*  I think I've improved my perspective on things [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11844.16s)]
*  and the way I treat people. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11847.08s)]
*  But you've grown. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11848.12s)]
*  And you're a better person. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11848.960000000001s)]
*  I mean honestly, you're an amazing person. [[03:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11850.76s)]
*  But I will always know you as the dude [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11853.26s)]
*  that walked me into his house. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11857.06s)]
*  I will never know you as this thing. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11858.42s)]
*  Like this thing is pretty fucking insane. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11860.86s)]
*  It's just like cool for you, but that's not. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11863.6s)]
*  But my version of it is fairly small. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11865.32s)]
*  You've been pretty good at keeping your head straight. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11868.62s)]
*  Because I hang around with the same people. [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11870.58s)]
*  I go to the club. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11872.82s)]
*  I go to home. [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11873.9s)]
*  That's the key ingredient. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11874.74s)]
*  I work out. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11875.58s)]
*  I do all the things I have to do. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11876.42s)]
*  It's not just that, I have new friends. [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11877.86s)]
*  It's just like I fucking torture myself. [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11879.46s)]
*  So my perspective is balanced. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11882.779999999999s)]
*  The worst thing that happens during my day [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11885.699999999999s)]
*  is probably not as bad as what I've done to myself. [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11887.98s)]
*  So I go into every day with a baseline. [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11890.58s)]
*  I can handle shit. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11894.14s)]
*  That hasn't changed in you at all. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11895.58s)]
*  No, it's the best way to regulate things. [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11897.22s)]
*  What Henry Rollins was saying in that essay, [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11899.26s)]
*  it's the best way to regulate things. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11901.9s)]
*  It's the best way to keep a perspective on things. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11903.699999999999s)]
*  You don't wanna become a tyrant. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11906.539999999999s)]
*  You don't wanna become enamored with power [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11908.48s)]
*  and enamored with influence. [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11911.039999999999s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11913.279999999999s)]
*  You're not a guy who says, do you know who I am? [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11914.119999999999s)]
*  I'm not interested in that at all. [[03:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11916.08s)]
*  If you don't know who I am, I'm happy. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11918.199999999999s)]
*  I'd love to talk to a dude who doesn't know me. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11922.119999999999s)]
*  That's gonna be shocking. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11924.199999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be shocking. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11925.039999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, it'd be fun. [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11925.88s)]
*  Talk to somebody else. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11926.919999999998s)]
*  When was the last time you had that? [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11927.759999999998s)]
*  Or someone was like. [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11929.519999999999s)]
*  Because you can tell sometimes. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11930.359999999999s)]
*  What do you do for a living? [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11931.179999999998s)]
*  What? [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11932.019999999999s)]
*  I don't know, sometimes people bullshit you. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11932.859999999999s)]
*  It's great. [[03:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11934.519999999999s)]
*  Sometimes people pretend they don't know who you are. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11935.359999999999s)]

*  I go, how do you not know who I am? [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11942.26s)]

*  Eric Von Daniken is the one who wrote [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11962.140000000001s)]
*  The Chariots of the Gods. [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11963.82s)]
*  He wrote that book about ancient aliens coming down here [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11965.46s)]
*  and building the pyramids and all this wild shit. [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11968.4s)]
*  And he knew that I was gonna, [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11971.359999999999s)]
*  he knew I knew everything about this guy. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11974.199999999999s)]
*  I knew everything about his book. [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11976.4s)]
*  I watched his documentary multiple times. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11978.039999999999s)]
*  I've seen all the criticisms about it. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11980.72s)]
*  I wanna have this conversation with him [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11982.08s)]
*  and find out why he thinks the way he thinks. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11983.32s)]
*  But when he said, what do you do for a living? [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11985.4s)]
*  Because he didn't know who I was. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11988.039999999999s)]
*  I was like, I'm a comedian. [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11989.16s)]
*  And Weinstein started laughing. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11990.96s)]
*  And he goes, well, he's, I go, I'm a comedian. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11993.6s)]
*  And he started explaining the podcast [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11997.5s)]
*  and all that different stuff. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=11999.300000000001s)]
*  But I was like, just tell me what you think. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12000.140000000001s)]
*  Tell me what you think and why you think. [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12002.5s)]
*  If you ask me what I do. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12004.300000000001s)]
*  It's gonna change the answer. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12005.66s)]
*  It's also, it's like, I like that he didn't know who I was. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12007.140000000001s)]
*  This is wonderful. [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12009.58s)]
*  This is wonderful. [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12010.9s)]
*  This is a nice conversation. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12011.82s)]
*  Totally. [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12013.06s)]
*  And respectfully, why do you believe this? [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12013.9s)]
*  And why do you ignore all the evidence [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12016.140000000001s)]
*  that seems to lean to an advanced civilization [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12019.18s)]
*  that built this? [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12021.78s)]
*  We have a rebuilding of advanced civilizations today. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12023.320000000002s)]
*  That's much more plausible. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12026.480000000001s)]
*  But his whole business is sort of, [[03:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12028.640000000001s)]
*  once you have an initial assertion [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12031.640000000001s)]
*  and you write a book about it [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12033.160000000002s)]
*  and you make a documentary about it, [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12034.0s)]
*  everybody's gonna say, you can't change your opinion [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12035.28s)]
*  because that book's still on the shelf. [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12038.76s)]
*  I bought your fucking book. [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12040.44s)]
*  Your book's bullshit. [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12042.240000000002s)]
*  The book's what I thought back then. [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12044.240000000002s)]
*  I didn't know any better. [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12045.660000000002s)]
*  But that was a good one. [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12048.240000000002s)]
*  It's fun meeting somebody and you don't know who they are? [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12049.160000000002s)]
*  I know everything about him. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12051.98s)]
*  I had studied him for so long. [[03:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12054.74s)]
*  I had studied his film. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12058.339999999998s)]
*  I watched his film multiple times. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12059.46s)]
*  Because his film asks real questions. [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12061.38s)]
*  Like how the fuck did they do this? [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12063.74s)]
*  There's some stones in Lebanon [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12065.66s)]
*  and some fucking crazy quarried stones. [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12068.4s)]
*  Like how the fuck were they planning on moving this? [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12072.339999999998s)]
*  Well, they had abandoned the stone [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12075.38s)]
*  because there was a crack in it. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12076.419999999998s)]
*  And so they moved on. [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12077.46s)]
*  So they have the evidence [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12078.3s)]
*  of how they actually quarried these things. [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12079.259999999998s)]
*  I don't understand all those ancient structures. [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12080.720000000001s)]
*  When you think about what it takes, [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12085.6s)]
*  how we build things today, [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12086.76s)]
*  and you see these things built, [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12088.08s)]
*  and it's like a hundred thousand pound stone. [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12090.04s)]
*  It's the best evidence [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12092.84s)]
*  that people were more advanced back then. [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12093.980000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12095.400000000001s)]
*  And then you go, and not only is it together, [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12096.240000000002s)]
*  where it's seamless between two, [[03:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12098.960000000001s)]
*  you can't put a piece of paper between them. [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12101.36s)]
*  It's all aqueducts. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12103.0s)]
*  What they did was probably follow a line of innovation [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12104.900000000001s)]
*  that's different from the line we follow. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12112.380000000001s)]
*  One that we can't really relate to. [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12114.26s)]
*  Data VHS. [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12116.660000000002s)]
*  We followed combustion engines, industrial evolution, [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12117.5s)]
*  manufacturing on a large scale. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12121.58s)]
*  That's what we followed. [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12123.18s)]
*  What they followed is probably something very different. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12124.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12126.62s)]
*  You probably had to do with frequencies and sound [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12127.460000000001s)]
*  and how you could bore through stone. [[03:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12130.68s)]
*  They had diamond drills. [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12134.32s)]
*  Do you think if they saw our stuff, [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12135.88s)]
*  they'd be like, what the fuck? [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12136.96s)]
*  Yeah, they'd probably be weird out by the internet. [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12138.119999999999s)]
*  If they didn't have it. [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12141.0s)]
*  But the thing is, if you have electronics [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12141.92s)]
*  and you leave them on the ground, [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12144.4s)]
*  they don't exist in a hundred years. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12146.08s)]
*  They will get absorbed by the earth. [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12147.96s)]
*  Within a thousand years, there's no trace. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12150.08s)]
*  You'll find the minerals that are in the batteries [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12152.36s)]
*  and all that stuff that all break down. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12156.44s)]
*  There'll be nothing left. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12157.88s)]
*  There's nothing. [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12159.2s)]
*  If you watched buildings that were in Detroit [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12160.1s)]
*  that people abandoned and you see trees growing [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12163.5s)]
*  through those buildings. [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12166.18s)]
*  Quickly. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12167.02s)]
*  Quickly, man. [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12167.84s)]
*  Houses, cars. [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12169.06s)]
*  You see a car that gets left in the woods. [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12170.86s)]
*  It just gets broken down to rust. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12172.92s)]
*  And within a thousand years, there will be nothing. [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12174.86s)]
*  So if there was some shit that existed, [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12178.9s)]
*  like the conventional dating of the Great Pyramid [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12182.26s)]
*  is 2500 BC, that's under heavy speculation. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12185.14s)]
*  The real belief is it's probably the guys [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12188.92s)]
*  from John Anthony West and Graham Hancock [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12191.96s)]
*  and Randall Carlson. [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12194.16s)]
*  They point towards a possibility [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12195.64s)]
*  of a super sophisticated civilization [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12198.68s)]
*  more than 11,000 BC. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12200.84s)]
*  See, I think that's the thing that I've never really considered. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12203.279999999999s)]
*  No, really considered is that you always go, [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12206.359999999999s)]
*  oh, they had like an archaic system that just worked. [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12208.64s)]
*  Right. [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12212.4s)]
*  Like levees and pull. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12213.24s)]
*  No. [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12214.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12215.44s)]
*  What if they had like full electronics [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12216.26s)]
*  and like ray guns and stuff. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12217.32s)]
*  Never considered that shit. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12219.02s)]
*  You think we have to be the best. [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12220.1s)]
*  We have to be. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12222.02s)]
*  Instead of this start over, this start over. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12222.86s)]
*  The way they move things, [[03:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12224.14s)]
*  they move things that were thousands of pounds. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12225.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12230.42s)]
*  Through the mountains. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12231.26s)]
*  If another 500 years passed from here, [[03:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12232.34s)]
*  how much technology will this, [[03:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12234.34s)]
*  if that all gets wiped out, it'll get started over [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12235.66s)]
*  and we'll be at our level and they'll be like, [[03:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12238.34s)]
*  well, they were less advanced. [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12239.86s)]
*  I'm the same way as you. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12240.98s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12241.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12242.86s)]
*  So you have, [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12243.7s)]
*  because you think of like a hundred bodies [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12244.539999999999s)]

*  If that's it, preppers. [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12256.76s)]
*  People that have fucking bunkers [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12258.519999999999s)]

*  You could use this as a stand for your table. [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12275.7s)]
*  They're eating at the dinner table [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12277.98s)]

*  yeah, these survival preps. [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12289.1s)]

*  Look at, what are the chances those people [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12297.04s)]

*  how long till you could send me an email? [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12304.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12306.42s)]
*  It'd be millions of years. [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12307.26s)]
*  If you had access to all the tools [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12309.220000000001s)]
*  that people have ever created. [[03:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12310.82s)]
*  Yeah, look at that stone. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12311.9s)]
*  Where is that one, Jamie? [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12313.82s)]
*  Egypt, the unfinished obelisk, [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12315.0s)]
*  like in theory they would have. [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12316.74s)]
*  Raised it up. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12318.300000000001s)]
*  Taken it out of there somehow. [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12319.14s)]
*  So there was an obelisk they cut into the stone [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12320.34s)]
*  and they had the technology to not only cut that, [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12323.54s)]
*  but unfortunately some of that stone would crack [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12326.34s)]
*  and they would have to abandon it. [[03:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12328.2s)]
*  But they had to pick it up and move it hundreds of miles. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12329.720000000001s)]
*  And they did it routinely. [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12335.66s)]
*  There's no way to like grasp that [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12337.220000000001s)]
*  unless you think the technology was other level. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12341.34s)]
*  Not only that dude, [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12344.26s)]
*  there's a lot of evidence that even the great pyramid [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12345.74s)]
*  is a more recent creation to some of the older kingdom work. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12348.86s)]
*  The deeper they go into the sand, [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12352.66s)]
*  on some of the structures they'll find [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12354.74s)]
*  like as they start excavating [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12356.42s)]
*  that there's another structure underneath it [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12358.36s)]
*  and then they uncover that. [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12360.5s)]
*  And the older they uncover them, [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12361.94s)]
*  it seems like the larger the stones were, [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12363.6s)]
*  the more complex the systems were. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12365.76s)]
*  It's wild shit, man. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12368.16s)]
*  These people were doing something a long fucking time ago. [[03:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12370.72s)]
*  And if you listen to guys like Robert Schock, [[03:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12374.28s)]
*  who's a geologist from Boston University, [[03:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12376.28s)]
*  he studied the erosion marks [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12378.28s)]
*  on the outside of the temple of the Sphinx. [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12380.08s)]
*  He said this is indicative of thousands of years [[03:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12382.12s)]
*  of rainfall that created this. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12384.6s)]
*  This is where you get these kind of fissures in the stones. [[03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12386.42s)]
*  The only time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12389.8s)]
*  was like 9,000 BC. [[03:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12394.02s)]
*  So you gotta go back thousands of years to predate that [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12396.220000000001s)]
*  because you have thousands of years of rainfall [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12400.140000000001s)]
*  when it's a rainforest. [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12402.42s)]
*  All that area, like the Sahara Desert [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12404.300000000001s)]
*  used to be a fucking tropical rainforest. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12406.66s)]
*  Wow. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12410.380000000001s)]
*  All this shit happened before we were fucking [[03:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12412.900000000001s)]
*  driving diesel trucks and coal plants. [[03:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12416.380000000001s)]
*  The world has been in a constant state of flux forever. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12420.42s)]
*  And that area where they initially established [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12424.460000000001s)]
*  the kingdom of where Giza was and Cairo is [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12427.56s)]
*  and all those areas, that area was lush with resources. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12432.2s)]
*  That's probably why they advanced there for so long. [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12435.52s)]
*  They did some wild shit in this one area [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12439.08s)]
*  that there's wild structures all over the earth [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12442.56s)]
*  that they found, but nothing compares [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12445.08s)]
*  to what they did in Africa. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12447.0s)]
*  Nothing, not a one thing is anything like [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12448.34s)]
*  the Great Pyramid of 2,300,000 stones [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12451.699999999999s)]
*  moved from quarries hundreds of miles away, [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12455.779999999999s)]
*  cut in a perfect position, true north, south, east and west. [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12458.1s)]
*  It's fucking wild what they did [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12462.779999999999s)]
*  and I think they were probably more advanced than we are. [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12464.58s)]
*  That's what I think. [[03:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12467.34s)]
*  It has to be. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12468.18s)]
*  I know, and when you see it firsthand, [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12469.02s)]
*  like going to Machu Picchu up in the Andes, [[03:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12470.539999999999s)]
*  you're like, what? [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12474.42s)]
*  How do they build this up in the mountains? [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12475.58s)]
*  Just imagine if everything collapsed right now, [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12477.06s)]
*  what people would be like 200 years from now? [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12479.84s)]
*  They would be fucking barbarians. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12483.08s)]
*  Totally. [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12484.519999999999s)]
*  They would be walking dead, walking dead people, [[03:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12485.359999999999s)]
*  like living in little groups and tribes, [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12488.119999999999s)]
*  trying to stay alive and eventually they would rebuild. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12489.76s)]
*  But I think it would take forever [[03:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12492.359999999999s)]
*  and I think that's what happened. [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12493.68s)]
*  Do you ever think about that like, [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12494.92s)]
*  you go technology exists with the same things [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12497.199999999999s)]
*  that were available hundreds of years before? [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12503.08s)]
*  In other words, same like elements. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12506.42s)]
*  There is nothing new put here. [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12508.78s)]
*  We just were able to develop a phone. [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12510.7s)]
*  And every technology builds on the previous technologies. [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12514.220000000001s)]
*  Someone's invented this and we go radio waves. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12517.460000000001s)]
*  If they didn't tap into that, [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12519.5s)]
*  then that civilization never had radio. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12520.560000000001s)]
*  So if someone events something quicker, that's different. [[03:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12522.460000000001s)]
*  Like if someone events nuclear fission, like way early, [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12526.060000000001s)]
*  and everybody's like, whoa, [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12530.380000000001s)]
*  or someone events cold fusion, way early. [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12531.380000000001s)]
*  You're like, okay, well now we've solved this energy problem. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12535.0s)]
*  Now we can move in a different direction. [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12537.359999999999s)]
*  Or stops plague early. [[03:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12538.68s)]
*  Yeah, early. [[03:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12540.0s)]
*  That allows you to like burn. [[03:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12540.96s)]
*  Do you think all the technological stuff [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12541.8s)]
*  that has evolved is with the theory [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12543.48s)]
*  that we are borrowing from, [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12546.52s)]
*  we've taken from basically alien life, [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12548.439999999999s)]
*  leaving technology here or giving us hints? [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12551.88s)]
*  No, I think the alien technology thing is fascinating, [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12555.439999999999s)]
*  but it might also be bullshit. [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12558.96s)]
*  You always have to look at all these things [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12560.88s)]
*  that are public and that are talked about [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12563.56s)]
*  in the Pentagon releases, things about, might be bullshit. [[03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12565.82s)]
*  You always have to think it might be bullshit. [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12569.18s)]
*  Every time I look at any phenomenon, [[03:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12570.859999999999s)]
*  whether it's UFOs, UAPs, [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12573.1s)]
*  whatever the fuck you wanna call them, [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12574.82s)]
*  I always say to myself, if I was the military [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12576.34s)]
*  and I had some top secret drone program [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12581.26s)]
*  that moved through a totally unique [[03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12584.3s)]
*  and novel propulsion system that operated on gravity, [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12587.539999999999s)]
*  and that we figured out how to do this, [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12591.46s)]
*  we can move it around, and I would be testing [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12593.72s)]
*  in exactly the same places these people were testing. [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12596.0s)]
*  They were testing in all this restricted airspace [[03:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12599.48s)]
*  where they would run these military drills. [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12601.9s)]
*  They did it off the East Coast [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12604.92s)]
*  and they did it off the West Coast. [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12606.359999999999s)]
*  So where they're seeing these things [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12607.779999999999s)]
*  is exactly where the military runs their tests. [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12609.359999999999s)]
*  I would assume that if I was the military, [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12614.439999999999s)]
*  that's how I would think. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12617.82s)]
*  I would hide things. [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12619.4s)]
*  I would hide things by saying they're UFOs [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12620.22s)]
*  and saying we have no idea what this is. [[03:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12623.199999999999s)]
*  And if you have top secret programs, [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12625.64s)]
*  which we 100% know they do, [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12627.24s)]
*  and if you have a theory of propulsion [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12629.679999999998s)]
*  that's based on gravity and not on igniting [[03:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12632.199999999999s)]
*  combustible fluids like rocket fuel, [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12635.199999999999s)]
*  which we definitely have, and they have had [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12638.0s)]
*  since I believe the 1950s, they first started theorizing [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12640.0s)]
*  about magnetic propulsion systems. [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12644.08s)]
*  They probably have been developing this forever. [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12646.92s)]
*  They've probably been doing it in secrecy [[03:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12650.66s)]
*  and probably China's doing it as well. [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12651.7s)]
*  And the best way to hide it, I would imagine, [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12653.7s)]
*  would be to say that this is something from another world. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12655.82s)]
*  Also, we might be visited by other worlds. [[03:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12659.54s)]
*  Also, we might be visited by things from other dimensions. [[03:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12663.08s)]
*  I think it might be all the above. [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12666.26s)]
*  And I don't think you can count out any of it. [[03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12668.3s)]
*  Just because of the fact that we know there's planets. [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12670.5s)]
*  If we know there's planets, [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12672.82s)]
*  they're far enough away from the sun [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12673.78s)]
*  that the water doesn't boil and nothing freezes. [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12675.3s)]
*  If they're in that Goldilocks zone, maybe life can develop. [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12678.98s)]
*  And we know that there's a shitload of those out there. [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12681.9s)]
*  We've found a bunch of them already. [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12683.939999999999s)]
*  So if they're out there, we would assume [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12685.66s)]
*  that something would be like us plus 100 years, [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12687.599999999999s)]
*  plus 500 years, and they would want to go [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12690.419999999998s)]
*  to these other planets and say, [[03:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12692.9s)]
*  look at these crazy fucks with Flint tools [[03:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12693.939999999999s)]
*  trying to start fires by knocking sticks together. [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12697.3s)]
*  And we would say, let's leave them on the radio. [[03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12700.14s)]
*  And I think that's what they do. [[03:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12704.539999999999s)]
*  And that's what this Diana Pasoca was saying [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12705.939999999999s)]
*  about researchers were describing [[03:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12708.54s)]
*  these crashed UFOs as donations. [[03:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12710.62s)]
*  So if I was from somewhere else, [[03:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12713.900000000001s)]
*  whether it was another dimension or another planet, [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12715.52s)]
*  and I wanted to accelerate the technological innovation [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12718.060000000001s)]
*  by these beings, I would give them fiber optics. [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12721.18s)]
*  I'd go figure that out. [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12724.18s)]
*  Crash this thing, back engineer it, figure it out, [[03:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12725.42s)]
*  get your brightest minds, lock everybody down, [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12728.34s)]
*  shoot everybody with a big mouth, [[03:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12731.12s)]
*  and figure out how the fuck to make this. [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12732.820000000002s)]
*  And I think that's what the Bob Lazar story's all about. [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12735.52s)]
*  Bert? [[03:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12738.32s)]
*  I was not listening. [[03:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12739.16s)]
*  Ah! [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12740.32s)]
*  I got lost, I got lost. [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12741.44s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds cool. [[03:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12743.68s)]
*  What'd you get lost in? [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12745.64s)]
*  Buddy, when you started with propulsion, I was like. [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12746.76s)]
*  He was like, how many letters is that? [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12751.0s)]
*  It's funny, I felt like I was listening to your podcast. [[03:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12751.84s)]
*  I got no shit I should learn. [[03:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12753.76s)]
*  You are while it's happening. [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12755.84s)]
*  Let's all take a nap. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12758.8s)]
*  I love your brain. [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12759.64s)]

*  I'm seeing you fiddle with that the whole time. [[03:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12812.56s)]
*  That is a Bammoth ivory handle for a 1911, [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12813.380000000001s)]

*  Oh, it goes in like that. [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12820.04s)]

*  That'll be fun for you. [[03:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12834.599999999999s)]

*  How are you gonna take all that shit off [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12838.48s)]
*  in the time that it takes? [[03:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12839.759999999998s)]
*  Takes a second. [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12840.759999999998s)]
*  No, keep it on. [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBURsKmyJWo&t=12841.599999999999s)]
