# Joe Rogan Experience #2187 - Adam Sandler
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T_0Tcts6aM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Hello, Alex.
*  Hey, Joe.
*  Good to see you, buddy.
*  What's going on?
*  I'm so happy to be here, buddy.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  I'm happy to have you here.
*  I was excited to see you.
*  We know each other a long time, and I was excited to come to Austin, of course.
*  You were just talking about how Zookeeper was 14 years ago.
*  I was shocked.
*  How?
*  How?
*  I know, I hate that.
*  Time just fucking flies by, man.
*  It's terrible.
*  It's terrible.
*  That was a fun time, though.
*  KJ was so excited.
*  That was very fun.
*  That was very fun.
*  I remember.
*  Yeah.
*  You and KJ was sussy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's how you guys...
*  I've known Kevin for 30-something years.
*  I've known him forever.
*  It's funny because even your stand-up...
*  I watched your stand-up the other night.
*  You guys remind me of each other.
*  There's something...
*  You take your time on stage, you set it up, you say your shit, and you live in it.
*  It's not the same, but you can tell you guys are buddies.
*  There's something about it that feels like...
*  Everybody feels like, I would hang out with that guy.
*  But did you and KJ start stand-up together?
*  Well, we didn't start together exactly.
*  I started in Boston, he started in New York, but I met him when I was like, I guess two years in.
*  About two years in.
*  Where did you guys meet?
*  In New York.
*  At the strip or something?
*  I think we met at Eastside.
*  Eastside.
*  I don't think I did...
*  That's downtown?
*  No.
*  Eastside Comedy Club was on Long Island.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I used to go there.
*  That was in Huntington?
*  Huntington.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a great club.
*  That was Richie Manorvini's place.
*  That's right.
*  That's Manorvini.
*  Yeah, that's a funny bastard.
*  Yeah, he's a funny dude.
*  One of the first comedy clubs I watched, I think I saw Carol Leifer at the Eastside Comedy
*  Club.
*  My sister lived in Huntington.
*  She said, do you want to go see...
*  It wasn't my first, but it was like first couple.
*  She said, do you want to see a comedian?
*  There's a club around here.
*  I said, yeah, yeah.
*  I sat in the back.
*  I think I might have been 15 or something.
*  16.
*  Wow.
*  And I saw Carol Leifer kill for an hour, I think.
*  That was exciting.
*  That club was rocking.
*  Yeah, it's gone though, right?
*  Are there good clubs in Long Island now?
*  What's that?
*  Well, geez, man.
*  I don't know what's happening.
*  There was always Governors.
*  Governors was great.
*  That always existed.
*  Yes.
*  I remember there was a few bars that were comedy clubs that I used to do there.
*  I don't remember the names right now, but back in the day when I was young, I would
*  go out to the island.
*  Governors, I don't think I got on there much, maybe a couple of times when I was young.
*  That was kind of a rocking club.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Steve-O.
*  Do you remember Steve-O?
*  No.
*  I know Steve-O, the Jackass guy.
*  No, there was another guy, Steve-O, who was a funny comic.
*  And John Mulrooney, you remember Mulrooney?
*  Sure.
*  I remember.
*  He was kind of huge out there.
*  He used to be a cop, right?
*  I think so.
*  I remember Mulrooney was by far, him and Kevin Meany were the two guys you didn't want to
*  go after.
*  I remember Mulrooney would just destroy a room.
*  He was so loose and would dominate the room.
*  And then they'd bring you up and you're like, oh, goodness gracious.
*  I saw Kevin Meany once at Catch a Rising Star in Cambridge.
*  And it was insanity.
*  He was at his peak, absolute peak.
*  I wasn't even thinking about doing comedy then.
*  I was just a comedy fan.
*  I went with a friend of mine from high school.
*  I think we were both like 18.
*  And we saw him just fucking destroy for an hour to the point where I got out of there.
*  It was like I had an ab workout.
*  I was in pain.
*  I was like, Jesus Christ.
*  He was so in the groove.
*  Everything he did was funny.
*  Man, and I've never in my life killed this hard as Kevin Meany.
*  There's nobody you can kill.
*  I remember me and Rock would be on the side at Catch a Rising Star watching Meany do
*  whatever he did.
*  And he was just like, yeah, I don't think I can get laughs that loud.
*  It fucking blew out the room every time.
*  He was on fire.
*  He was on fire.
*  But it was weird.
*  It's like it didn't sustain.
*  Like he later in his career, for whatever reason, it just, whatever he had for those
*  few years, like in the 80s and the early 90s, it didn't keep going for some stranger.
*  He kept doing stand up, but something was missing.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  I know we killed on The Tonight Show with Carson.
*  I'm sure he went and destroyed and did all.
*  I don't know what he wanted.
*  I don't know what the next thing he wanted.
*  I just remember maybe didn't he do a TV show, Uncle Buck?
*  Yeah, but that was not that good.
*  That was the John Candy movie.
*  Did they turn into a television show?
*  I think there was always the thing that he was in the closet and then he came out of the closet.
*  And then it was kind of like right before he died.
*  I'll tell you, I did a Boston Club comedy connection when I was 17.
*  I ate it.
*  I came off state.
*  I mean, I bombed and my dad was there watching.
*  It was a terrible feeling.
*  And even the emcee who I don't remember when I came off stage after eating it, I'm walking.
*  You know that awful feeling of walking through the crowd and they're looking at you like, Jesus, dude.
*  And then the fucking emcee stopped me.
*  He goes, Adam, Adam.
*  I turn around, you know, your head spinning and shit.
*  I look at the guy, he goes, class clown?
*  I go and nod my head like, yes.
*  He goes, maybe stick with that place.
*  I go, OK.
*  You know, I fucking walked off.
*  And then I went into the dressing room because I wanted to hide.
*  And Meanie, Meanie, you funny kid, blah, blah, blah, said some nice shit to me.
*  I always remembered, oh, that can't be me.
*  Fucking good, dude, man.
*  He was lifting me up.
*  Yeah, some encouragement from a real comedian when you're just starting out can go a long way.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Because in the beginning, it's so shaky.
*  You don't know if it's going to work out.
*  What am I doing?
*  Oh, you feel you go off stage.
*  Oh, you feel you go home at night head spinning.
*  What am I doing to myself?
*  Why am I doing this?
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  It truly is the sickest feeling.
*  And then there's the days or nights you go on stage and your shit, you're not doing good.
*  You're eating it, but you have a confidence and you're like, I'm pretty good at this, even though I'm fucking eating it.
*  I feel pretty good right now.
*  You feel like this is I'm going to figure this out.
*  Yeah, right. Exactly.
*  I'm going to figure it out.
*  Yeah.
*  Your movies kept my family sane through the beginning of the pandemic.
*  We went on an Adam Sandler run where like we watched basically every we don't want we didn't watch his little Nicky.
*  We didn't for whatever reason.
*  We never got to that one because we watched other ones like two or I watched the Zoe.
*  I might have seen the Zoe and 20 times.
*  Wow. I fucking love that.
*  Thank you. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Such a funny movie.
*  Why didn't you ever do a second one?
*  That's fucking always talked about it.
*  I mean, dude, the the.
*  It's a no brainer.
*  It would be a tough sell right now.
*  We'd have to wait a minute.
*  Put that one on the shelf for a little bit.
*  We had to put that one on the shelf a bunch of times when we were about to do it because shit would go on.
*  We'd be like, it's a tough time to do it right now.
*  And then we just we got it.
*  We did it.
*  The intention was good to try to say, let's try to get some peace out there.
*  But and then another part of it is I'll never fucking be in that shape again.
*  I don't think I could ever do that.
*  And then you can hire a trainer.
*  Get it. I know, but I can't stick with it, buddy.
*  You are doing great.
*  How the fuck are you eating so good and hitting it so hard?
*  I'm like, you know, I used to fucking take working out so serious when I was in maybe up to like 25, 26.
*  And I can't fucking do it.
*  I play who then I eat and I every even walk every time I'm eating.
*  I'm going, what are you doing?
*  You don't need to do this.
*  I can't stop.
*  Just got a little bit of thickness all over.
*  Yeah, it's something that just you you have to stay on the horse.
*  You can't back off at all, especially as you get older.
*  Yeah, back off at all.
*  You just start. What is this?
*  You start feeling like I know I have a new nobody.

*  Well, you fucking walk in now and I go, Jesus, that'd be fun to look like that.
*  I always fucking wanted to be.
*  I had no shit when I was 18 to 23.
*  I hit it so hard.
*  I never looked like you.
*  I never was Jack.
*  You look good during the Zohan.
*  Pretty good.
*  Really good.
*  Pretty fucking good for me.
*  That was as good as I can get.
*  And I naturally had a little something going on when I was real like the college years.
*  But now it's fucking rough.
*  My kids go, my daughter, one daughter, Sadie's always saying, Dad, get the training from the Zohan.
*  Why would you ever give that up?
*  Why did you stop?
*  I was like, it's a lot of work.
*  Yeah, but didn't you like the way you felt?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, you should do that.
*  Get that feeling back and stuff like that.
*  But I just can't jump in there.
*  Well, she sounds like a good coach.
*  She's a good motivator.
*  Saying the right stuff.
*  She's right.
*  Everything she says, I have a thought where I don't promise her.
*  I go, let me think about that.
*  That's a good idea.
*  The whole thing is just not overdoing it in the beginning.
*  Start slow where it's maintainable and then slowly build up.
*  That's the key.
*  So you give yourself new goals?
*  Well, I never stop.
*  But I mean, when you get started.
*  Yeah.
*  And the thing is like people try to go too hard, like, oh my God, I'm out of shape.
*  I'm going to run fucking 10 miles and I'm going to lift weights and I'm going to do it.
*  And then you're too tired.
*  And then you're so fucking sore in the morning.
*  Like, I can't keep this up.
*  The whole key is just give your body enough where it's pushing it, but it's not exhausted.
*  You're not breaking your body down.
*  You're just strengthening it slowly.
*  You got to get sick the same way or you got to get better the same way you got sick.
*  You got sick over time.
*  Over time, eating food and fucking up.
*  And then you got to get better that way.
*  Over time, slowly start to morph your body back into a good condition.
*  That's good.
*  Everybody tries to go too hard.
*  They try to go too crazy.
*  You get excited.
*  They do something unsustainable.
*  You get excited to get it going again.
*  And then you get injured.
*  You break yourself down.
*  You hurt your knees.
*  You hurt your back.
*  It's too much.
*  Yes, yes.
*  Tear or something.
*  Yeah.
*  The key is just not do too much.
*  Just do enough and just cut back on you.
*  Say, I'm going to only have two cheat days a week.
*  Two days a week, I'm going to eat whatever the fuck I want.
*  Five days a week, I'm going to eat clean.
*  And then break it down to six days a week, I'm going to eat clean.
*  And one day a week, I'm going to fuck off.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  If you can go one day a week just fucking off, you can get a lot done.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  The fuck off day is from start to finish.
*  You can do whatever the hell you want.
*  Do whatever the fuck you want.
*  One day.
*  And then the other days, the good days, what do you, like, do you eat a breakfast and all
*  that shit?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I skip breakfast.
*  That's my new move the last year.
*  Like intermittent fasting?
*  I guess so, but I'm supposed to fucking lock in on eight hours or six hours.
*  And I always say I do one to nine, say, then around fucking 10, I go, let me have some
*  grapes.
*  And then I go, I think I'm not supposed to have grapes.
*  And then I go, a few grapes.
*  And then it opens up to some other shit.
*  Grapes aren't the problem.
*  The grapes lead to some bad shit.
*  The grapes lead to waffles.
*  Fucking skinny cow.
*  That's the new thing.
*  Skinny cow ice cream sandwiches in the house started to have a little problem for me.
*  What are skinny cow?
*  They're supposed to be a little better for you because the calories aren't awful.
*  I think it's like 130.
*  So I go, 130.
*  Usually they're fucking like 330.
*  So then I eat two of them.
*  I go, it's still under that 330.
*  Then I go, if I have a third, it's still in the threes.
*  So I eat a third.
*  And then I fucking go, I got to stop.
*  Yeah.
*  If you really want to be serious about taking, just hire somebody.
*  You got money.
*  I got the best guy.
*  I got the guy who did me for the Zo-Han.
*  I love him.
*  It's just I see him and I love him so much that I go, let's keep this a friendship.
*  I don't want to.
*  I play so much basketball though.
*  That keeps me okay.
*  It doesn't want me to take my, I don't want to take my shirt off.
*  How often do you play?
*  Maybe four or five a week where I get out there and run for my money.
*  That's great.
*  That's pretty good.
*  That's very good.
*  That's a key if you could do something that you really enjoy doing.
*  Yes.
*  You know, if you something that keeps you active that you enjoy, that makes it so much easier
*  because you're playing a game.
*  So you're getting fit for sure in the middle of a game.
*  Exactly like, you don't hate that at all.
*  That is the best.
*  I think that's the only thing I got that you you you fight that.
*  That's fucking fun, right?
*  Martial arts are fun.
*  Yeah.
*  Martial arts are fun.
*  K.J. always fought.
*  I never even thought.
*  One time K.J., we left a hotel and I think he just came from fighting with one of the guys who were
*  teaching him some shit and he was so riled up from it, put me in some fucking crazy hole.
*  I don't know where we were walking.
*  We were going to dinner.
*  All of a sudden he came at me.
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  And he fucking grabbed me, twisted me around, had me in some weird hole.
*  I said, oh, okay.
*  He's just letting me know he can destroy me.
*  But I remember just going, yeah, that's that's fucking something I should get into, man.
*  But I just can't. I'm not flexible at all.
*  You're very flexible.
*  Yeah.
*  That helps.
*  Well, I started stretching before I hit puberty.
*  That's the big thing.
*  Or during puberty, really.
*  So it's like while your body's thickening, you know, you're you're keeping it loose.
*  That buddy's a giant difference.
*  I never.
*  By the way, K.J. with being flexible is very odd.
*  He can put the hand.
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucking weirdly.
*  Very athletic guy.
*  He just eats like a fucking army.
*  He does get excited.
*  He I sometimes when we were young, I'd say, tell me your McDonald's order.
*  And he'd be like, OK, three quarter pounders, three big mac, whatever the fuck it was.
*  He goes hard.
*  His McDonald's order is insane.
*  Kevin, go hard.
*  But like you also when he was on the podcast, told me he fasted once for how many days?
*  Yes, 60 somethingers.
*  Yeah.
*  Some insane amount of it was like 40 days or something.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Mania.
*  Something insane.
*  And then I think he ate a sandwich and it really hurt.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  You're so much probably like, what the fuck is going on?
*  Oh, my God.
*  He's a mad man with that fast.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's a he's an intense dude.
*  You know, just intense with eating, too.
*  Yeah.
*  But if you ever watch him hit the mitts, every watching him.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  He can fucking strike.
*  Yes, I know.
*  It's kind of shocking.
*  Yes.
*  People that don't know him.
*  Yes.
*  You see him crack mitts and you're like, Jesus Christ.
*  Holy shit.
*  He is.
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucking legit and he and he can roll around good, too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When he was getting ready for Here Comes the Boom.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, you know, when he was training with Mark Delagratt.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Damn, dude.
*  He was cracking those.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  He did let me know when that one thing he did to me.
*  You know who did that to me, too?
*  Farley.
*  Farley, we were in the hallway on Saturday Night Live out of nowhere.
*  Oh, no, we were at a fucking hotel and he came at me real fast.
*  He grabbed me, put me in some shit, pulled hard.
*  I felt every part of my body crack.
*  And then I then Farley laughed.
*  And just like with Kevin, they kind of looked at you like I could fuck you up if I wanted to.
*  Farley was a big dude, too.
*  He was a big boy.
*  He was like maybe 5'8".
*  He was like 5'8 wide, too.
*  He was wide.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking athlete though, moved nice.
*  Well, when he moved around on stage, you know, when he moved around on SNL, he was fucking
*  That was part of the thing is he was so explosive.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like part of the funny in him was he's fucking insane.
*  Yeah.
*  He had this explosion inside of him.
*  They could get out.
*  I only met him once.
*  You did meet him?
*  Yeah, I met him on the set of News Radio and he was in the middle, the throes of addiction.
*  So he was gray, like wet cardboard.
*  It was weird.
*  It was weird being around him.
*  He just looked sweaty.
*  He's like, hey, how you doing?
*  I was like, hey, what's up?
*  Was he there to see Phil?
*  He was there to see Andy Dick.
*  He and Andy Dick were hanging out.
*  I think they were both off the rails.
*  They were having fun.
*  They were having a good time.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, fucking that sucks.
*  I hate it.
*  Well, he was.
*  Yeah, that's horrible.
*  That was a good time of life though, huh?
*  That News Radio shit.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That was a lot of fun.
*  It was Spade and Phil.
*  No, Spade wasn't on that.
*  Spade was on that other show, Just Shoot Me.
*  He was on Just Shoot Me, but I thought he did a couple of things.
*  He did.
*  Yeah, he definitely did.
*  But, you know, he was on that other show, Just Shoot Me.
*  He was on Just Shoot Me.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  A lot of people did.
*  Was that your first big thing to lock into?
*  Yeah, that was the first big thing.
*  I did a small sitcom that nobody watched before that called Hardball.
*  Hardball, what was it about?
*  It was a baseball show on Fox.
*  Yeah, I think I remember that.
*  No one lasted like five or six episodes.
*  What were you on that?
*  I was a baseball player.
*  Oh, that, you played baseball?
*  I did in high school.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  A little bit, until I was in high school.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  I was in high school.
*  I was in high school.
*  I was in high school.
*  I was in high school.
*  I was in high school.

*  I was in high school.
*  I was in high school.
*  I was in high school.
*  Already doing it.
*  Already advanced.
*  And I was like, all this did was make me realize these guys can kick the shit out of me.
*  I thought, guys, I could take...
*  I was going, oh, fuck, that guy can crush me too.
*  I had no idea.
*  But I'm never flexible.
*  So I just, I think I quit after like four or five sessions.
*  Flexibility is something that everybody can gain.
*  It's just you just have to go through the process.
*  Flexibility is not something like, you know, there's like certain amount of explosiveness
*  and athleticism that some people just don't possess.
*  It would take a long time to get there.
*  But flexibility is something that you just have to work at.
*  I've seen very inflexible people become flexible.
*  Yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  What, just by doing it every day?
*  Doing it every day and just sticking to a routine.
*  You just got to force yourself past the pain.
*  I'm just nervous.
*  My hamstrings are going to pop this whole fucking tight.
*  You know, you ever see one of those things where it's like a strap and you put your foot into it?
*  Yes.
*  You get pulled back.
*  Those things are great.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Just take a yoga class.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Go to hot yoga.
*  That's a cheat code.
*  No, that's a good one.
*  It gets real hot in there.
*  You get a lot looser.
*  Yeah, that's good.
*  That's good.
*  No, my wife's good at that shit.
*  My daughters do it.
*  I just fucking, it hurts my lower back and my hamstrings so much that I end up just going,
*  I get up and do a fake water break and just stare at them.
*  So, how was working on the special?
*  I saw you in Vegas.
*  I saw you stand up.
*  I know you did.
*  It was very funny, man.
*  Thank you, bud.
*  Very funny.
*  I really enjoyed it.
*  I appreciate it, man.
*  I had a great time making the special.
*  I had a great, I have a great time on the road.
*  I can't believe it.
*  You know, I fucking quit doing standup for, you know, like 20 years or something.
*  What made you want to get back?
*  I think I was doing grownups and Rock and Spade and Schneider and KJ were always talking
*  about next weekend I'm going to Niagara Falls and I'd be like, these guys are all fucking
*  having fun on the road.
*  And then I think Apatow was doing Carnegie Hall.
*  He was hosting something and he said, you want to do some standup again?
*  And I just go, yeah, yeah, let me do that.
*  And I did it just to make sure that I fucking put together 15 minutes or something.
*  That got me back into it.
*  And did you just piece it together by doing small sets or did you, how did you write it out?
*  I was, I think maybe I did a couple of improvs or something that maybe I went to the improv
*  a couple of times, but mostly from doing Letterman.
*  I used to do Letterman and do two segments.
*  So I'd fucking sit down with my buddies, write jokes and just go out there with jokes and
*  kind of trusted that, yeah, that's a good joke.
*  And I think I started doing that with standup too.
*  Just going, ah, this is pretty good.
*  Let me just do it.
*  And then like, when did you start booking gigs?
*  Same shit.
*  I called the guy, this great guy whose daughter was going to school with mine.
*  He would talk about booking acts and shit.
*  I said, I was thinking of doing standup again.
*  He wanted to book me some shows.
*  And then he just booked like a 10 city tour for me.
*  And I said, all right, I better fucking put an hour together for that.
*  Wow.
*  So how did you put the hour together?
*  Did you go to the improv?
*  Did you go to the store?
*  Where'd you go?
*  A couple of times at the store, improv.
*  I would drive out of town, you know, the valley, maybe an hour.
*  Like the ha ha.
*  That kind of shit.
*  Yes.
*  Anybody.
*  Flappers.
*  Flappers is a good spot to try shit out.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I just did a bunch of maybe I went down to the Comedy and Magic Club.
*  Is that still?
*  Yes, I did.
*  I did.
*  That's a great club.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  I accept.
*  I remember growing up, I would always see Leno and Joe.
*  Is it Joe?
*  Is it Brogan?
*  What was it?
*  What was?
*  Jimmy Brogan?
*  Jimmy Brogan.
*  Yeah, the Booker.
*  Yeah, but he did standup as well.
*  He did standup and they were so clean and they would fucking annihilate.
*  And I always felt self-conscious in that place for how filthy I was.
*  I was like, these people don't want to see this.
*  Well, the Comedy and Magic Club is like the cleanest club in the country.
*  That right, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, Jimmy Miller used to book it.
*  Did he?
*  I think so.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, At Patel used to always go there.
*  Yeah, that's a great little club.
*  That's a good club.
*  So I forced myself to get a good out.
*  Now I got, I mean, when I was on the road to the last tour, I have so much shit that steps on other shit,
*  so I can't really do it all.
*  Right.
*  Because if I already said this, so this joke doesn't make any sense now.
*  But I was fucking doing two-hour shows and it wasn't that big of a deal.
*  Wow.
*  Can you believe that?
*  Yeah.
*  Because I remember struggling to do an hour of my whole standup life.
*  I'd be like, my God, how fucking, the crowd's so bored with me now.
*  I can't come up with new moves, you know?
*  But now, got enough shit, keep them rocking.
*  So how long have you been steady doing standup again now?
*  I think like seven years.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Must feel good though, right?
*  It's nice, man.
*  To get back into like a real flow, like a real headliner flow again.
*  100%, yes.
*  And go, oh yeah, I missed this.
*  I did miss it.
*  I didn't even know I missed it.
*  It's the most fun.
*  Absolutely.
*  You fucking were loose.
*  That was, you set yourself up to do a live fucking special.
*  I don't think I could handle that, man.
*  My head be spinning way too much, man.
*  But you had to over-prepare.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  But you didn't have any pauses.
*  You were just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
*  How long were you doing that set?
*  Well, I did, well, you know, because I have my own club that helps a lot, right?
*  So I was doing two shows a night, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
*  So I was doing six hours of stand-up a week, which is a lot.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And then I was doing podcasts and all the other UFC stuff that I do.
*  So a lot of work.
*  Right.
*  That got to be too much.
*  So then I knocked it down to three sets a week, three headliner sets a week.
*  And then I would do a bunch of short sets.
*  You know, that bottom of the barrel show that I told you that my friend Brian Simpson hosts,
*  that show's the best.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a premise factory.
*  Yeah.
*  Because you have this whiskey barrel on stage.
*  It's filled with notes from the crowd.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's all just different ridiculous ideas for premises.
*  And you reach your hand in, you pull one out, and it says, you know, frogs are gay.
*  Right.
*  Like whatever it is.
*  And you just start ranting about it.
*  Right, right.
*  And you try to come up with bits.
*  And you land on good shit.
*  And every now and then, you get one or two every set that you write it down.
*  You're like, this could be something.
*  That's amazing, yeah.
*  And a couple of them made it onto the special.
*  That's incredible.
*  Because it's like, it's a premise factory.
*  Absolutely.
*  So I had a lot of it.
*  I was getting ready to do a special.
*  I was going to do one in August of 2020.
*  But then, you know, obviously in March, everything shut down.
*  And I didn't do stand-up for eight months.
*  And then I thought about it.
*  I was like, you know what?
*  I just feel like just working on my material now.
*  I just feel like just working on stand-up.
*  Yeah.
*  Not even thinking about the special.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's a great feeling.
*  I was just enjoying working at the club, owning the club.
*  And then there's so many good guys at the club.
*  It was just such a fucking hot spot.
*  Right.
*  There's so many people.
*  There's Shane Gillis and Mark Norman and Ari Shaffir
*  and fucking Brian Simpson and Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  It's just like every night was just murderers row.
*  Right, yeah, yeah.
*  And we were all just cooking together.
*  That's big.
*  And then when Netflix said they want to do a live special with me,
*  at first I was like, fuck that.
*  I don't want to do that.
*  And I said no.
*  I told my manager.
*  I was like, no.
*  I called her on the phone.
*  I was like, what?
*  I don't want to do that.
*  And then I was driving home.
*  I'm like, why are you scared to do that, you fucking pussy?
*  And I was like, as I was driving home, I was thinking.
*  And then when I got home, I called her back.
*  I go, don't say no yet.
*  I go, let me think about it.
*  Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I've had those feelings, yeah.
*  And then the next day I said, all right, I want to do it.
*  And she's like, you sure?
*  I go, yeah, yeah.
*  I'm going to do it because I'm scared of it.
*  That's ballsy, man.
*  I was fucking terrified of it.
*  Of course.
*  I'm scared thinking about doing it.
*  I would never fucking do it.
*  But you killed it.
*  You killed it.
*  You were loose.
*  You were rolling.
*  You were crushed.
*  Well, I did that set in order for three weeks straight.
*  Right.
*  So I had it locked in.
*  Yes.
*  For three weeks, I didn't do any.
*  No, which I always fuck around.
*  That is, there was no fucking around.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  No deviation for three weeks.
*  That's right.
*  You were steady.
*  Exactly.
*  I also wrote all the bits out by hand.
*  I wrote them all out.
*  Even the ones I already knew.
*  I wrote them all out.
*  I wrote all the transitions out.
*  I listened to recordings.
*  I watched videos.
*  That's big, yeah.
*  I beat myself into the ground.
*  That's good.
*  I overprepared.
*  Right, right, right.
*  So then when I got up there, there was no, what is next?
*  What is next?
*  There was no thought about.
*  You didn't have a beat sheet somewhere just in case you got lost?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  That's fucking balls.
*  I would never be able to do that.
*  But I wanted to treat it like a regular show.
*  If I had a regular show, I wouldn't have a cheat sheet.
*  Well, I fucking, I never did when I was young, but now I need fucking a word.
*  I need to look somewhere and see the word.
*  What do you like, put like index cards on the stage?
*  No, no, on a monitor.
*  I just look down and go.
*  Oh, okay.
*  You know, it says like, you know, just one word.
*  Popcorn.
*  Popcorn and then I'm ready.
*  Because my head goes to space.
*  I get spacey as I got older.
*  When I was young, I was prepared and boom, boom, boom, boom.
*  I did my shit.
*  And I think it helps me kind of relax a little bit.
*  Just knowing that if I'm lost, I look down and see a word and go, yeah, yeah, yeah, do that next.
*  Bill Ma brings like one of them conductor's fucking things on stage.
*  You know, like they have like the news, the music rather.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He has that and he just has his ideas written out on that.
*  So you just look down at it.
*  I get addicted to that a little too much.
*  Sometimes I in Largo in L.A., I go up there.
*  Flanny runs that place and he lets me go on and and and try shit out.
*  And I have a music stand and I fucking I'll be at work all day working on movies and then like 10 minutes left to go.
*  I go, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Let me fucking I got a couple of guys in the office who helped write jokes with me and I go, let me try this.
*  This is this.
*  Put the sheet down.
*  Go on stage.
*  Try shit out.
*  Try new shit out.
*  Nothing better than a new joke.
*  Yeah, it's very exciting.
*  That's the best if it's working.
*  Usually does work too.
*  Well, you're enthusiastic about it.
*  And if you really have thought about it and prepared for it, it's like a new thing for you.
*  So it's an exciting new toy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So you can't wait to get to that or open with it or whatever.
*  When you do movies, do you just come up with a premise first?
*  Like when you decide to do a film, like if you decide to do Happy Gilmore, how do you how do you like make your movies?
*  How do you start?
*  That's I mean, that was just lucky premise.
*  Billy Madison.
*  I remember I thought, oh, this could be great.
*  A guy who a grownup who does elementary school again.
*  And that's a great idea of being I get to be goofy, get to bully these little kids, then all of a sudden connect with these kids and have fun growing up again.
*  So my part of my head was like, well, Rodney did back to school already.
*  So everyone's going to say I just ripped off back to school.
*  Rodney went back to college.
*  How the fuck do we kind of do it?
*  A step away from that.
*  And I called my buddy Hurley, he who I went to college with and he writes all the movies with me.
*  Or he's just a he's just a great funny man.
*  And I've written almost everything with him.
*  And if he goes, oh, that's good.
*  Then we usually go from there and we try to fill it out after that.
*  Same thing with Happy Gilmore Wedding Singer, Bobby Boucher, all that shit.
*  We were just like came up with a couple of lines of what we thought as an interesting idea and then see if we can fill it out.
*  It's so funny because your films get loved by the public and hated by critics.
*  It's so hilarious.
*  You are the like whatever the Rotten Tomatoes critics score is for your films means zero.
*  It means nothing.
*  It's only the audience is what counts.
*  That's all we thought about.
*  Yeah.
*  Because your films are all so fun and so silly and so, in my opinion, so underappreciated.
*  Thank you.
*  This is like this is one of the things I thought about during Covid.
*  It's like we watched it every night.
*  We watched like every film that you made while everything was locked down.
*  Amazing.
*  I love that.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah.
*  My fucking I don't know, man.
*  We lucked out where we we we worked our asses off like you're working your ass off now.
*  Like this is this is took it very serious.
*  But you caught like a silly groove.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think anybody else has that silly groove like you do.
*  You caught that groove with so many movies, man.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  We did.
*  I mean, when I first started, Jim Carrey was crushing Stiller, Mike Myers, a lot of a lot of goofy movies were getting made.
*  And I certainly fucking love doing them.
*  And I love being on set, making those kind of movies.
*  I love fucking editing that shit.
*  Making thinking about kids laugh.
*  And I always love that.
*  Thinking of college kids throwing it, you know, throwing a tape and sitting down watching together.
*  We that was on our mind when we did it.
*  When you first started out, did you want to be a comic?
*  Did you want to be a standup comic or did you always think that you wanted to do films?
*  I think I wanted to get into the movies.
*  I was fucking nuts.
*  Cocky as shit in my own weird way.
*  I think a big thing that happened to me was I told my friends in high school I was going to be a comedian.
*  I told my friends in high school I was going to be fucking big.
*  And I didn't.
*  So you had to?
*  I had to do it.
*  I told the boys I was like, I'm going to be fucking great.
*  And then when I would check in with them, I remember being on payphones calling after even eating it as Catch a Rising Star.
*  I call them up.
*  Fucking did good tonight.
*  Yeah.
*  I go, yeah.
*  I said, what'd you say?
*  I said, this joke fucking killed.
*  Meanwhile, I fucking ate it every time.
*  So you're faking it until you made it.
*  But I dug a hole for myself.
*  I'm doing great.
*  Robin Williams said I was fantastic.
*  Robin Williams, I remember one night saw me eat it.
*  I was just like, oh, man, I ate it in front of Robin Williams.
*  But I changed the story of like, yeah, he liked that shit.
*  There's something that could be very valuable about being delusional and being young.
*  Yes.
*  Very delusional.
*  So stupid, man.
*  I did this thing once.
*  Do you know Owen Smith?
*  Who the hell is that?
*  Hilarious comedian in LA.
*  He had this, he's one of the best comics alive, but he spends a lot of time writing and doing shows, unfortunately.
*  I'm sure I know.
*  Which I think he should be headline in arenas.
*  He was just at my club a few months back.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Fuck, he's a monster.
*  The point is, Owen had this show that he was doing for a while where you'd find your oldest notebooks and sit down with him and go over your oldest jokes.
*  And it was so bad.
*  It was like a 1991 joke book.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I keep them all.
*  And I was going through, we were reading and I was like, it's so bad.
*  I had him like built in heckler lines that I wrote that were terrible.
*  And this guy was saying this to me.
*  And it's like, oh, oh.
*  That's so funny.
*  If I had to go back there and like give myself advice, I would say, you got to quit.
*  You're terrible at this.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Don't do this.
*  What are you doing, man?
*  Yeah, don't do this.
*  You sound atrocious.
*  You're not going to make it.
*  Same thing.
*  Yeah, no way.
*  But I fucking thought I was fucking phenomenal.
*  I would look at the crowd, not laughing, going, these fucking are these guys fucking nuts?
*  They don't see how great this shit is.
*  But when I it's almost like I was with my fucking giant Afro and my father would be at the table and be like, you need a haircut.
*  I'd be like, what are you talking about, man?
*  He'd be like, you think you look good?
*  I look great.
*  He'd be like, you don't.
*  Just so you know, you don't look great.
*  You were so off on that day.
*  It's funny.
*  Delusional thinking can sometimes carry you to the like once you develop some skill that delusional is like a little guardian.
*  Yeah, like she protected while you actually develop talent.
*  And that goes away because I'm more nervous now.
*  Well, I had that fucking fear as a comedian.
*  My head would spin.
*  When Colin Quinn, he had a club, the Paper Moon, and the in the city was the Paper Moon around when you when you growing up.
*  It was like the Boston Comedy Club, like a small place like that.
*  I think that that became Paper Moon became the ball of the same club.
*  Yes, I think it was downstairs.
*  That one shit.
*  So fucking Colin like me, he used to get me on stage.
*  I was going to college around there and I all day long would be practicing on the elevator in my dorm.
*  I'd be going, saying the shit right when Colin would bring me up.
*  My fucking head would spin.
*  I'd forget where I was.
*  Not making sense.
*  I would say two jokes and then I'd be like, oh my God, I don't I don't know what's coming next.
*  And I had that going for a while, but I still would go home at night and go, fuck it.
*  I'm going to be so fucking good at this.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  Psycho, psycho.
*  It's youthful delusion.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's also your central lobe is not fully formed.
*  You don't even understand the world.
*  You're just a little meat puppet.
*  My God.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's how you make it.
*  That's how you make it in kind of everything.
*  Like you're delusional.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  If you really believe in yourself, that counts for a lot.
*  Up to a point, because there's people that still believe in themselves.
*  They've been doing open mics for 20 years.
*  Right.
*  Nobody's stepped in to say, hey, this is never right.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  And a half. Right.
*  Yeah. You have to have a spark.
*  Yeah.
*  There's got to be a little something in there.
*  And then you could build that little something into something special.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  Same thing in sports guys who keep going and keep trying out and keep doing something.
*  But some some people break through.
*  It's yeah.
*  It's interesting, man.
*  I definitely had an amazing time as a youngster.
*  I had a couple of people that I locked in with.
*  We were buddies.
*  We all had that same thing of like, I'm good.
*  I'm good.
*  Even though it wasn't that good yet.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. I came up with Greg Fitzsimmons.
*  Greg and I were both like confused and wondering if we're ever going to make it.
*  And just, you know, we do a lot of road gigs together and we were hoping.
*  But it's the whole idea was only just to like one day you'd be a professional.
*  That was the goal.
*  Not really have any kind of a career career, but just one day to make a living telling jokes.
*  That was the dream.
*  Yeah.
*  You couldn't even imagine.
*  Like almost I would see guys that were actual pros when I had a bunch of like day jobs doing construction.
*  Oh, you did.
*  And limos.
*  Oh, yeah. Everything.
*  Oh, gotcha.
*  And so then I would do these nighttime gigs and I'd meet the real pros.
*  The guys who just made a living doing comedy.
*  I'm like, what must that be like?
*  Yes, they saunter in at nine.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah, they've been playing golf all day.
*  And the Kevin Knox's.
*  Yeah, man.
*  All those guys.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And I would just like they were like heroes.
*  Of course.
*  You're the you actually made it.
*  Fucking badass.
*  Outside of the system completely.
*  All you do is tell jokes and people love you and they come to see you.
*  And the same jokes.
*  A lot of the guys, they were just like, that's my act.
*  Oh, in Boston?
*  Yeah. They never did television.
*  So those guys had.
*  Right. Right.
*  And people wanted to go see those same jokes again.
*  That's right.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Like Steve Sweeney.
*  You ever see Sweeney when he was in his prime?
*  Absolute best.
*  Biggest destruction, too.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Steve Sweeney in his prime would light up a room.
*  Yeah.
*  And with Boston accent and Boston material, you couldn't follow him.
*  No, no, no.
*  He was a monster.
*  I think he went on the very first night I went on Stitches.
*  Sure.
*  That was the first place my brother brought me to Stitches.
*  He was going to be you.
*  He got me one of those five minute open mics.
*  That was the first place I ever did, too.
*  Stitches?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow, man.
*  Yeah.
*  How'd you do?
*  Eh.
*  I got a couple of chuckles.
*  You did?
*  It was like enough to where I was like, maybe.
*  21?
*  21, yeah.
*  I was like, maybe.
*  Maybe something.
*  And the second time I got some laughs.
*  That's incredible.
*  The second time was less nervous.
*  Wow.
*  And I had listened to my record.
*  I had a little tape recorder that I brought with me and I recorded it.
*  Oh, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I had the impression of the silence on the recorder.
*  Oh, it was terrible.
*  But it also made me realize what was wrong.
*  Because I was studying it kind of the way I study martial arts.
*  If you would watch films of fights and then I would go, oh, there was a little bit of
*  a timing problem there and I could have done this.
*  I could have done that.
*  Yes.
*  And so with my second time I did stand up, I had the humiliation of listening to the
*  first cassette.
*  Yeah, I got that.
*  I listened and I was like, let me tighten this up and maybe this could be a little better.
*  Oh, my God, tighten it up a little bit.
*  And write a little more there.
*  But I got some laughs the second time, which was like crazy.
*  I was like, wow, I might be able to do this.
*  Shit, man.
*  Both at stitches?
*  Yeah.
*  And then I think I bombed the third time and that was the first real bomb.
*  And I was like, ooh.
*  A punch in the face.
*  Fucking scary.
*  Yes.
*  But every time I bombed, I feel like it taught me something and then I would get better.
*  I ate it last year.
*  Last summer, I went up to the comic strip and fucking ate it for 10 straight minutes.
*  I went, oh, shit, I forgot about that.
*  I forgot about that punch in the face.
*  That is a roughie.
*  I ran into you at the airport and you were telling me you just did some fucking horrific
*  corporate event.
*  I ate it there too.
*  Oh, that was, I mean, if I listened to the tape, I'd say you were okay, but oh, it's
*  humiliating.
*  Yeah.
*  You had just gotten done with it when I ran into you.
*  That's not so I was shell shocked.
*  I remember seeing you and your wife.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I had that fucking glazed look.
*  Those corporate gigs are so, Ron White just ate it at one recently.
*  He goes, I don't know why the fuck I agreed to do that.
*  I know.
*  I never did it.
*  I said no and they said more and I said no and then they came up with a number.
*  I was like, all right.
*  Holy shit, buddy.
*  Same fucking story for me.
*  Those are deaf.
*  I don't think I.
*  Those things are deaf because the people that are there, they're working with all these
*  people, so they're all like kind of tight.
*  Yeah, they got shit going on.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're not really thinking about the comedy show.
*  They're thinking about this is like a social environment with all the people that they're
*  working their way up the corporate ladder and they're concentrating on all their shit.
*  And they're also, they can't laugh at anything inappropriate.
*  That's true.
*  I saw Mike over there laughing at all those sexist jokes.
*  Mike's a real piece of shit.
*  That's true, man.
*  That's good.
*  I swear to God, I felt bad for them.
*  I was like, Jesus, they paid me so much.
*  I fucking feel terrible.
*  I didn't kill for it, but it happened.
*  Yeah, Hinchcliffe just did one recently too.
*  He said the same thing.
*  I'm like, that's why I don't do those.
*  It's not.
*  Do comedy where people come to see comedy and that's it.
*  Don't get hired for a birthday party.
*  Get the fuck out of here with that.
*  It was the only fucking reason I did it was Paul McCartney did it the year before.
*  So they go, well, they don't do this much.
*  I went, Paul McCartney, well, fuck, I'm doing that shit.
*  Yeah, but Paul McCartney can just play his songs.
*  I know, man.
*  You know, and like his songs are great.
*  They're classics.
*  He's not going to miss.
*  He's not going to miss.
*  He's just going to play the, and if they don't respond, that's on them.
*  Yeah, it's like, you know, you fucking nuts.
*  You just did Band on the Run.
*  What the fuck is wrong with you people?
*  I know, man, that's good.
*  Yeah, you know, like musicians, they can always just get into their songs.
*  Oh, shock.
*  They don't need your response.
*  They can close their eyes.
*  They don't need nothing.
*  They don't need you.
*  They don't look around.
*  They don't need you.
*  We're fucking looking at everybody.
*  That fucking dude's not loving it.
*  God damn it.
*  We rely so much on other people's response.
*  But the moments I don't, those are the ones I was saying to you, Joe, and I've eaten it
*  before, but still felt I did good because I fucking remained kind of confident and believing
*  in my shit still.
*  But the ones where I look out, I see them hating me and I go, yeah, why am I here, man?
*  That's a bad feeling.
*  It's a terrible feeling.
*  I say bombing on stage is like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother.
*  But the problem is, it's probably worse than that because somewhere out there, there's
*  probably a guy who wouldn't mind sucking a thousand dicks in front of his mom.
*  You know, he'd be like, look at me, Mom.
*  You bitch, you made me.
*  99, let's go.
*  My mother would 100% at the end say you could have done it better.
*  Yeah.
*  You could have sucked them hard.
*  Why did you stop on that one man?
*  He wanted to explode in your face and you stop.
*  I feel bad.
*  You should call him and tell him you'll suck his dick.
*  But yeah, yeah, I'm with you, buddy.
*  Yeah, stand up.
*  Stand up's the best.
*  It's a crazy thing and no one can teach you how to do it either.
*  You have to figure it out yourself because your way of doing it is different than my
*  way of doing it.
*  My way is different than Kevin's way.
*  Kevin's way is different than fucking Seinfeld's way.
*  Everybody's got a different way of doing it.
*  Absolutely.
*  And nobody can teach you how to do it.
*  You can learn some things from watching other people.
*  You can learn some things.
*  Oh man, yeah.
*  But how about when somebody fucking great watches you and says, hey, you know what you
*  could say here and gives you a great line.
*  You're like, oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that's huge.
*  That's what I feel.
*  And you just made my OK thing into a fucking one I'm excited to do.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There's been a couple of bits that I've had that got a tag from a friend and it just like
*  pops it up.
*  Oh, you're like, how did I ever do it without that fucking line?
*  Yeah.
*  Sometimes like a fresh eye, you know?
*  That's one of the things that I always admired about how Chris Rock used to do it.
*  Because Chris Rock would go on stage, he'd work his stuff out, and then you'd have a
*  bunch of guys that he would hire to sit in the back of the room and kind of workshop
*  with him.
*  I do similar stuff.
*  Very smart.
*  I have these young guys who are fucking way funnier at writing than me.
*  Only because I'm fucking tired.
*  I'm tired.
*  I walk into the office and I'm like, I thought of this funny thing last night.
*  Maybe something there.
*  I'll say it to them and they'll go, oh yeah.
*  And I'm fucking write something interesting.
*  And we come up with something together eventually.
*  Well, you're used to collaborating when you do films, right?
*  Yes, yes.
*  I always do that.
*  I always get a bunch of guys that help me out throughout the whole movie.
*  That's such a good process.
*  Yes.
*  Because one mind is great, but a bunch of minds together in different perspectives.
*  Yes.
*  People are going to see things from an angle that you're not going to see.
*  Yes, that's exciting.
*  Same shit.
*  Same shit.
*  Somebody comes up with a great thing to do in a scene or a line or maybe you can be doing
*  this at the same time and actually whatever the fuck it is.
*  I mean, me and Herlihy, when we write these things, we think a lot what it's going to
*  look like, what's going on in each scene and what the jokes are, that kind of shit.
*  But on the day, you're definitely having a couple of buddies around making it better
*  is the way to go.
*  Well, you always have a very tight ship too.
*  Doing Zookeeper with you and talking with Kevin, you work with the same people pretty
*  much every film.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is really huge.
*  Yeah, that's good.
*  Because you have a very family environment.
*  Always did.
*  It's always family.
*  Everybody's fun.
*  They're all, everybody likes working together.
*  Yeah.
*  No one's an asshole.
*  Yeah.
*  It's an easy gig in that sense that you know you're going to come to work with people.
*  Walking comfortable.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody's having fun.
*  Kevin's got that going.
*  You got that going.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you have to have that.
*  That's gigantic.
*  You got a lot of great stand-up friends, all right?
*  Yeah.
*  When you do The Road, you just bring your guys with you when you guys, like how many of you
*  go up on stage when you take gigs on The Road?
*  If I do a gig, I bring usually one guy who's a beginner and then two guys who are headliners.
*  And how much time does everybody do?
*  It depends.
*  Like when I did the live special, I brought this kid Ari Matty, who's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  Ari did 10 minutes.
*  Well, he did 15 minutes the first night, but on the live night, he did 10 minutes.
*  So 10 minutes to warm the crowd up, and then he brings on Ron White.
*  Ron White murdered for 15, and then he brings on Tony.
*  Tony murders for 15, and then I go on after that.
*  You're fucking tough to do that to yourself, put on big heavy hitters, because that can
*  get you in a hole sometimes, too, where people are crushing so hard.
*  Yeah, but as long as you're having fun, it doesn't, because the audience is having a
*  good time.
*  Yes.
*  My philosophy is I don't want bad comedians to go in front of me.
*  I want people to kill.
*  Yes.
*  So that when I go on stage, everyone's having a great time.
*  Yes.
*  They don't ever feel like, oh, they met that one guy for 20 minutes.
*  Oh my God, when was he going to get off stage?
*  No, I know.
*  Because there's some comedians that like to do that.
*  They like to bring in terrible acts so they look like a hero.
*  No, that's bad.
*  That's bad.
*  It's bad for the audience.
*  It's bad for your own brain.
*  You're just fucking getting lazy doing that.
*  You're getting lazy.
*  It's a soft way to approach it.
*  So when I do shows at the club, sometimes I'm going on stage an hour and a half into
*  the show, and it's like Brian Simpson, Shane Gillis, Mark Normans.
*  It's like killer after killer going up, and then I'm going up late.
*  It's like running with weights on.
*  You've got to come out of the gate.
*  Ha!
*  You know?
*  Dude, when I first came back to stand up, I was bringing all my buddies with me, and
*  they were killing so...
*  It was good crowds, so everybody would stay up.
*  Everyone's like, I know I was going to do 15, let me do 25.
*  And so by the time I got up there, I was following six or seven guys murdering, and it was fucking
*  two hours in, and then I was supposed to do an hour and a half of that.
*  I'd be like, shit, I've got to figure this out, man.
*  I mean, I'll cut my...
*  That's too much.
*  That's too much.
*  You wear the audience out.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like when a show gets over two hours, two and a half hours, it's like, I don't want
*  to see a three hour movie.
*  No, no.
*  If I'm going to watch a three hour movie, I want to be at home, okay?
*  Where I can pause, if I have to take a leak, go have some popcorn.
*  Like for three hours sitting in some auditorium somewhere watching a show...
*  That's a lot.
*  It's got to be a banger of a show where you're so engaged, where you walk out and you're
*  like, wow.
*  Haven't that feeling when you know, holy shit, this arena, I'm losing them for about five
*  minutes, let me fucking get them back.
*  Haven't that...
*  When you see people who started the show off with like, yeah, and then they're kind of
*  like tuned out going, what is happening right now?
*  Yeah.
*  But we have a certain amount of attention span.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That's why I admire bands that still...
*  I saw Guns N' Roses in Greece and they do three hours.
*  New shit?
*  No, all the classics.
*  All the classics.
*  Welcome to the jungle, sweet child of mine.
*  Can't fuck with them.
*  But they fucking go hard for three hours.
*  Those guys are a hundred years old.
*  They're fucking...
*  They're still killing it.
*  And he's singing three hours, actually ripping it for three hours.
*  Shit.
*  Same with the Stones.
*  The Stones a couple years ago at CODA, the Circuit of the Americas here in town.
*  And it was insane.
*  Mick Jagger's a thousand years old.
*  And he's still fucking moving on.
*  Button on him, baby.
*  He's still fucking dancing and all that energy.
*  It's funny, they do like...
*  Stones do two a week or something.
*  That's a really funny shit because when we go on the road, it's like five or six...
*  That's the way to do it though when you're 80.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  You need recovery.
*  Also, Mick Jagger works out every single day.
*  He has two trailers filled with gym equipment.
*  Wow, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Two of the trailers when they travel with the Stones is just Mick Jagger's gym equipment.
*  What a fucking stud, a light little body.
*  That guy looks like he weighs 120 or something.
*  He looks like 120.
*  He's ripped still.
*  He's ripped, yeah.
*  80 years old, he's got a six pack.
*  Got the manly arms ready.
*  Yeah, fucking ready to go.
*  And still has his pipes.
*  Still can sing.
*  Yeah, oh yeah.
*  And Keith Richard could still play.
*  It was incredible.
*  Watching them live, I couldn't even believe they were there.
*  It was one of those things where I felt like I was on drugs.
*  I was like, am I really seeing the Rolling Stones?
*  Are they actually there?
*  I could throw a rock and I could hit Mick Jagger with a rock.
*  He's right there.
*  Oh my goodness, I know.
*  And then how exciting when Keith and Ron look at each other and laugh.
*  Yeah.
*  They laugh together.
*  Fuck, that was incredible.
*  They're still enjoying it.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And when we were kids, there were no old rock stars.
*  Right, yeah, yeah, that's right.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  They didn't.
*  Elvis felt like, yeah, yeah.
*  He was already dead.
*  He died in the 70s, right?
*  So he was already dead.
*  Wow, man.
*  Wow.
*  And so when we were kids, we thought of rock stars as like Van Halen.
*  Young, wild people on stage jumping around.
*  That's a young man's game.
*  No one ever anticipated 80-year-old rock stars singing rock and roll in their 80s.
*  No doubt, no doubt.
*  By the way, I heard David Lee on your show.
*  Yeah, he's been on a couple of dubs.
*  Man, I mean, that band, to me, when I was in high school, I think I was in ninth grade
*  the first time I fucking heard them, I was into Sabbath.
*  My brother got me into Sabbath.
*  And then I heard I was walking up to a fucking party.
*  It was like one of my first house keg parties.
*  And Van Halen was blaring over somebody's pioneer system.
*  And it was fucking like ain't talking about love or some shit.
*  I remember just going, oh, this is the greatest shit I've ever heard.
*  Yeah, they were the kings in the 80s, dude.
*  They were the kings.
*  When I was in high school, everybody knew how to make that Van Halen logo on your notebook.
*  Yeah, the notebook.
*  It was either VH, Queen, Zeppelin, ACDC, Kiss.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They were the kings.
*  They were the kings.
*  But we never thought they'd be still doing it.
*  No, that's right.
*  And then you'd see Van Halen the last few years live and you'd fucking be still as excited.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd still look smooth as shit.
*  I saw it with David Lee Roth maybe four or five years ago.
*  He's such a character, man.
*  You know, he doesn't have a phone.
*  He doesn't even keep money on him.
*  I went to dinner with him and he has a lady that drops him off with me.
*  She's like his handler.
*  And she says, I have her number.
*  She has my number.
*  She's like, call me if anything goes wrong.
*  You know, and just you're hanging out with David Lee Roth having dinner with him.
*  I love him talking about fighting with you because you love him throwing those crazy roundhouse kicks.
*  Oh, yeah. He was a real martial artist.
*  Yeah.
*  He used to train with Benny Arquitas.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. He used to do those things on stage.
*  We'd do like a jumping split kick in the middle of the air.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Look at him.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a real athlete.
*  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
*  He's a stud fucking sweet dick on him right there.
*  But they...
*  Look at that guy.
*  Look at that picture where he's got his pants hanging down.
*  Yeah, just enough to show a little hip.
*  What is that?
*  Showing some dick root.
*  He's a character, man.
*  Still to this day, he's out to lunch, man.
*  He'll say some interesting shit.
*  He's smart, knows his shit.
*  Whatever he's into, he's deep into it.
*  That guy moved to Japan to train kendo, which is a sword fighting art.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Just him and his dog.
*  Yeah.
*  Lived in an apartment in Japan.
*  Fucking...
*  For like years.
*  Man.
*  Just training kendo.
*  I fucking...
*  Anytime you heard that they weren't getting along, you were just like,
*  Hey, what?
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking...
*  You know how that goes though.
*  Anytime it would four fucking people, too much, it's gonna go wrong.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially those egos and the bands and then girlfriends don't like that guy.
*  Right, right, yeah, that shit happens.
*  It's like Valerie Bertinelli apparently didn't get along with David Lee Roth.
*  Okay, yeah, that's gonna be painful.
*  That's how it goes.
*  It's hard for bands to stick together, you know?
*  I think that's way harder.
*  I remember you two would always meet in interviews,
*  talk about how cool it is that they're still a rock band together.
*  Yeah.
*  Four of them loving each other.
*  If you can get a band that enjoys each other's company,
*  that's a fucking tremendous, tremendous asset.
*  Because so many bands, like I was just reading today,
*  that Pete Townsend doesn't talk to the rest of the guys in the Who.
*  He doesn't talk to Roger Daltry.
*  They don't talk to each other.
*  Wow, wow.
*  Like how?
*  That's funny, man.
*  I just saw them.
*  I just saw the Who at a benefit and they fucking destroyed,
*  it was Daltry's benefit and he brought the Who on there.
*  And I think the drummer was maybe Ringo's kid.
*  Or it's either Ringo's kid or John Bonham's kid.
*  Anyways, it was great.
*  But Pete and Roger were funny as shit ragging on each other
*  and saying quick little insults and it was like massive laughs like a comedian.
*  But then they'd fucking have those hits that just take your whole body over
*  and it was great.
*  Yeah, I don't know where they stand now or why they stand that way,
*  but I was just reading an article this morning.
*  Yeah, oh yeah?
*  That they don't talk to each other.
*  Makes sense.
*  These guys, like I remember hearing Sabbath on tour,
*  would fucking all show up in different planes.
*  I don't know if any of it's true, but you're like fucking Tony Iommi and Ozzy
*  don't fucking hang out the whole time.
*  Well, there's always a problem in a band where the lead singer becomes the number one guy
*  and everybody else is kind of secondary.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's going to make you piss.
*  The band's called Van Halen, but the main guy is David Lee Roth.
*  That's the guy everybody wants.
*  Ain't talking about love.
*  Badass.
*  Yeah, oh my God, hot for teacher.
*  He was the man.
*  And so I could see how egos and feathers would get ruffled
*  and then the girlfriend on the side would be like,
*  you know, the band's named Van Halen, it's not named Lee Roth.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
*  Fuck that guy.
*  Fuck that guy and then you got to stand behind it.
*  He's got all the groupies.
*  Yeah, man, well, but they had some, him and Eddie both had the different people
*  who were talking about who's the greatest.
*  I mean, I think it would be like David Lee Roth was just the smoothest
*  and funniest and fucking.
*  One of the greatest front men of all time.
*  Fuck it.
*  For sure.
*  He was like a standup.
*  Just dominated the crowd.
*  Just like, I think there was some tape going around with,
*  I remember some shit just like, that's OK, man,
*  because after the show I'm going to fuck your girlfriend.
*  I don't know, maybe that was David Lee Roth or somebody else,
*  but as a kid you were like, oh my God, fucking what, that was the coolest shit ever.
*  But then I remember Eddie Van Halen when Jump came out the video
*  and seeing him smile and throw down that fucking lead
*  and he was just like, is that the coolest fuck on the planet?
*  With like overalls.
*  Oh yeah.
*  No shirt overalls.
*  I went with the fucking no shirt overalls move one time.
*  Really?
*  Didn't go over.
*  On stage?
*  Didn't get the respect.
*  Not as a standup, but I thought I was going to get more respect,
*  but I was on stage at a battle of the bands.
*  I used to sing and play guitar in a band and I went,
*  I think my mom tie-dyed my overalls and shit and I was like,
*  I'm going to do it, I'm going.
*  And I showed up and people were making too much eye contact with me,
*  not wanting to look down at the fucking overalls.
*  It's a bold choice.
*  It was one I couldn't make now.
*  One of the funniest choices is what,
*  if you look back at like the metal days,
*  like you look back at like all the guys who dressed up like gay bikers.
*  Right, right, right.
*  It's from Judas Priest.
*  Judas Priest.
*  It's Rob Halford.
*  Yeah.
*  Tricked everybody and he's dressing like a gay biker.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Because he was gay.
*  I loved it, yes.
*  So he's like leather pants and the fucking leather biker helmet on
*  and a vest with no shirt on underneath.
*  Yes.
*  And all these guys started dressing like that.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  They didn't even understand that they had been tricked into dressing like a gay biker.
*  Yeah, yeah, I loved that, man.
*  That's a great one, man.
*  He was so cool.
*  I saw them at fucking Radio City with Iron Maiden.
*  Really?
*  That was a biggie.
*  Wow.
*  I was up in the balcony screaming, screaming I want to dress like you.
*  No, that was good.
*  Yeah, look at him, man.
*  Yeah, the boy.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, come on, dude.
*  Fucking the Hellion.
*  They were nasty.
*  They were nasty.
*  They were nasty.
*  That's a tough looking guy.
*  You got another thing coming.
*  Yeah, that was a biggie.
*  Look at him there with his fucking crazy outfits.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's just so funny all the different styles of bands that existed.
*  Oh, man, I had fucking pleather pants.
*  I wore fake leather pants for a bit.
*  I didn't know my body wasn't great.
*  So I was like, you throw that shit on, you look like a rock star.
*  Then I'd fucking see the pictures that my mom took of me after I looked back.
*  I'd be like, how the fuck did you let me out wearing that shit?
*  It never fit just right.
*  I never had the body for it.
*  Like I would walk into a clothing store growing up.
*  There was a place, you know, Sarah Silverman, the comedian?
*  Sure, yeah, I know Sarah.
*  She grew up in the same town as me and her parents had a store called Junior Deb, I believe.
*  And it was downtown.
*  They sold Levi jeans and all that shit.
*  And I remember just going, OK, I'm going to get some cool ass Levi's, go to school, look like a badass.
*  And I remember when I saw a three way mirror, I was like, these aren't fitting me like I thought.
*  I don't look as cool in my Levi's as I thought I was.
*  You had an idea of your image.
*  I saw other people wearing that shit going, all right, I'm going to dress like that guy.
*  But it didn't reflect the same when I had it on.
*  Again, youthful delusion.
*  Delusion, yeah.
*  Did you want to be in a band before you wanted to be a comic?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I wanted that for sure.
*  What kind of music did you guys sing?
*  We did a lot of Aerosmith, a lot of Van Halen, a lot of Sabbath, Zeppelin.
*  Aerosmith just canceled their tour.
*  I know, I know.
*  I guess Steve and Tyler, you know, he had that neck injury where he fell and broke one of the bones in his neck.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And apparently he just can't sing.
*  He can't open his mouth to sing the way.
*  Well, they were planning on doing a thing with the Black Crows.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And they just, for whatever reason, decided to put the tour out and get going.
*  And then he started and he was like, I can't do it anymore.
*  That is painful, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the guy's whole life was that.
*  And by the way, fucking, did you like Aerosmith growing up?
*  Loved them.
*  They were the bad boys that every tune was nasty.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That shit was the nastiest.
*  Push that microphone up to your face.
*  Sorry, bro.
*  No worries.
*  And yeah, they, I loved, my band played literally like 10 Aerosmiths, too, as we'd always fucking play.
*  Kind of cool ones.
*  Not the massive hits, but the whatever, the Mama Kins and the Walkin' the Dog and kind of cool shit like that.
*  Well, we both grew up in New England and they were the kings.
*  They were the kings in New England.
*  They were the kings.
*  Yes, yes.
*  That was, they were the fucking band.
*  WAAF.
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah, AAAF.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Joe Perry.
*  BCN.
*  Yeah, BCN, AAF.
*  What was the kind of alternative?
*  Steven Tyler.
*  He was the fucking man.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Could hit every fucking, no.
*  How about the fact that I read something that, yeah, he's a cool bastard.
*  And I met him and they're all great guys.
*  Joe Perry, he's a great guy, too.
*  Fucking best.
*  That's a New England accent, too, on Joe Perry.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's funny to hear the boys talk.
*  I think somebody lived in New Hampshire.
*  Maybe Steven Tyler lived in New Hampshire because that's where I grew up.
*  That's where I grew up and they definitely, they owned New Hampshire.
*  Well, they were the kings of Boston.
*  They were fucking gigantic.
*  I remember the controversy when they did that song with Run DMC when they did Walk This
*  Way.
*  What the fuck?
*  I know.
*  Everybody was like, what's going on?
*  That don't make no sense, I know.
*  Meanwhile, that's a fucking great song.
*  That was when my fucking Aerosmith came back.
*  Yeah.
*  They became the kings again.
*  Exactly.
*  That was their big comeback song.
*  Yeah.
*  They're kind of faded for a while.
*  Yeah.
*  Then Walk This Way came along and it's like young people started getting into them again.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny how bands like they get generational, right?
*  Even though they're great, like, ah, that's the people that listened in the 70s.
*  Fuck those people.
*  Yeah.
*  Now we listen to this.
*  Yeah.
*  And then all it takes is one thing and then people start going through the catalog and
*  like, Jesus Christ.
*  Holy shit.
*  These guys are incredible.
*  Same.
*  I was doing, fuck, who the fuck was I listening to?
*  I listened.
*  I play a lot of the old shit for my kids.
*  And then all of a sudden you just go, wow, they had so many.
*  Bangers.
*  Bangers, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially the young drug taking days.
*  Yeah.
*  The wild, the wild Aerosmith days.
*  The first three albums kind of shit.
*  Like Zeppelin too.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a different world.
*  Yeah.
*  Every comic wants to be a rock star and I think most rock stars want to be comics.
*  Yeah.
*  There's some of that too.
*  There's something about the freedom of comedy that they appreciate.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  You don't have a band.
*  You don't need anybody.
*  All you need is a microphone.
*  You don't have sound guys.
*  You don't have anybody.
*  Can you believe that?
*  Yeah.
*  That's my biggest mistake is I fucking use music in my act.
*  So I gotta, my piano player, Dan Bulla, he's the best.
*  I love having him being together on the road, looking back and we laugh together.
*  That's the greatest part.
*  Back in the day when I just had a mic and didn't have to show up with shit, that really
*  makes it like easy.
*  Oh, it's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when I would do these big places like the TD Garden, like one of the things
*  that would strike me is like, we're just showing up.
*  There's no trucks.
*  There's no van.
*  It's just a stage.
*  Right.
*  And me and three of my buddies and that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  And 16,000 people.
*  But bands play here and they have fucking trucks and shit.
*  I know.
*  These people have to break down the stage.
*  They're all the fucking pyrotechnics and all that crazy shit these guys have.
*  Right, right.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  We're cool.
*  We're cool.
*  We did good.
*  We chose the right career.
*  For us.
*  For us.
*  Yeah.
*  Until you watch a rock band, you go, yeah, they're kicking our ass, man.
*  It's definitely something different.
*  Rock, I mean, rock is kind of like a drug.
*  There's something about going to see a band that's really good.
*  The music hits your body.
*  Yeah, it overwhelms you.
*  Yeah, like a drug.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  For sure.
*  The right tune fucks you up.
*  So I agree.
*  Who were some of your first concerts as a kid in Boston?
*  First concert I saw was Jay Giles band.
*  You did?
*  Yeah.
*  With Peter Wolf and fucking, that's as cool as it gets.
*  Yeah, back in the centerfold days.
*  Aerosmith and Jay Giles can battle for the kings of Boston back then.
*  Jay Giles was the fucking man when I was in high school.
*  See him, I saw George Thorogood, Johnny Winter.
*  Yeah, I saw a bunch of bands.
*  Where did you see them in that?
*  I don't remember.
*  I wish I could remember.
*  But then I got a job.
*  I used to go to Worcester.
*  Worcester, uh.
*  Sure, Worcester Coliseum.
*  The Centrum, yeah.
*  Yeah, is that what it was, the Centrum?
*  Yeah, I think so, yeah.
*  Then I got a job when I was 19.
*  I worked at Great Woods.
*  You did?
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck, and I played there.
*  What a feeling that was.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you know, you're in the shows growing up.
*  I saw a lot of comics there too.
*  When I saw some comics there, when I got paid, and then some comics there, I paid to see
*  them.
*  Right.
*  Like I saw Kinnison there.
*  I paid to see Kinnison.
*  You did?
*  That's cool, man.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw Cosby there.
*  I saw Rodney there when I was working.
*  Rodney was backstage naked with a bathrobe on.
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a big Rodney.
*  Those were the Rodney days, the bathrobe days.
*  Okay, baby, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we'd go on stage with a bathrobe just to make him feel comfortable.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He just was completely naked with a bathrobe on.
*  And just murdering.
*  Oh, the best.
*  I mean, murdering.
*  And this was before I'd even thought about doing standup.
*  I was 19.
*  Fuck, man.
*  But I got to see ...
*  You saw Kinnison.
*  Was he ... Kinnison always dressed badass.
*  Yes.
*  Like a rock star.
*  Yeah.
*  He fucking had the big long leather coat on and a beret.
*  Yeah.
*  I doubted ... That was just after I'd heard about Kinnison too.
*  Yeah.
*  I heard about Kinnison from a girl that I was working with.
*  I was working at ... Besides doing security guard work, I was working at the Boston Athletic
*  Club in South Boston.
*  Wow, yeah.
*  So I was a trainer.
*  That's still there, right?
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  I think they got a fucking basketball court there.
*  Yeah, they got basketball.
*  There was a lot of racquetball there.
*  A lot of people ... I met Bobby Orr there.
*  You did?
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  I had to help Bobby Orr because Bobby Orr had had fucking 150 knee surgeries.
*  His knees were destroyed.
*  And you'd have to help him get on the VersaClimber machine.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Bobby's knees didn't bend.
*  Right.
*  Bobby's knees bended like this much.
*  Right.
*  He had like 12 inches of movement in his knees.
*  That sucks.
*  And so you'd have to help him get on the VersaClimber machine.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, one of the greatest athletes of all time.
*  You watch him play racquetball and he would just kind of fall over.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Because back then ... They put it all out there.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Also, the knee surgeries back then were archaic.
*  Right.
*  They were so primitive.
*  Wow, man.
*  They just used staples and fucking screws and they didn't know what they were doing.
*  You see, at a certain age, you see different scars on guys.
*  Oh, his knees ... That's Bobby's knees.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  His knees were destroyed.
*  That sucks, man.
*  Man, what a hero.
*  What a stud.
*  I always loved him.
*  He had 20 knee surgeries.
*  Fucking insane.
*  Fuck.
*  Was that your team, the Bruins?
*  I didn't really watch sports.
*  Oh yeah, you didn't?
*  No.
*  Once I got into martial arts, I really didn't care about any sports.
*  That's pretty cool, man, that you didn't, because I know that's the biggest sport town
*  in Boston.
*  Oh, it was a huge sport town.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I didn't know anything about football, basketball, baseball.
*  I didn't care.
*  I was like ...
*  That's pretty good that you had your own thought process going.
*  I would join right in with trying to make the other kids like me, dropping something.
*  Well, when I was 15, I just became obsessed with martial arts.
*  That's great.
*  I didn't care about anything else.
*  I literally didn't care about anything else.
*  I'd watch basketball.
*  I'd be like, this is nonsense.
*  Who cares if that ball goes in that hole?
*  Fucking cool, man.
*  That doesn't mean anything to me.
*  My dad always told me to do that shit.
*  He'd be like, do martial arts, do martial arts.
*  I went to this guy's black cat.
*  I wish I knew his name.
*  I did that, and then I think a little earlier in life I tried it out.
*  My body, man, I wasn't meant for it.
*  It's not for everybody.
*  No, it's good, though.
*  That's like everything in life.
*  Things that are not for you.
*  You just got to find the thing that is for you.
*  I found a few, and that's all I do.
*  Hoop, comedy, that's it.
*  Perfect.
*  That's all you need for a happy life.
*  That's all I got.
*  Yeah, I guess so.
*  This girl I used to work with, she was like a volleyball player, and she was really hilarious.
*  She was working at the front desk, and she was like, oh my God, I saw this guy.
*  This is 1986, is when Kinnison had his HBO special.
*  She told me about it.
*  She was like, there's this guy, and his name is Sam Kinnison.
*  You know that bit he did about homosexual necrophiliacs paying money to spend a few
*  hours undisturbed with the freshest male corpses?
*  Remember that bit?
*  I kind of, yeah.
*  She told me about this bit.
*  We're hanging out in the parking lot of the Boston Athletic Club, and this girl is lying
*  down on her stomach on the ground.
*  She's like, oh, oh, real life keeps fucking in the ass even after you're dead.
*  It never ends.
*  I was laughing so hard.
*  I remember this girl, just her doing Kinnison's bit made me go to the video store to get a
*  VHS of Kinnison's special.
*  The first time I saw it, it came out on video.
*  I watched it, and I was like, oh my god.
*  That was the first seed in my head where I was like, okay, this is comedy too?
*  I didn't know that was comedy.
*  I thought comedy was something I really liked, but it was so different than me.
*  It was nothing that I would ever do.
*  It was just different.
*  It was like, I didn't see myself that way, but I saw that guy.
*  I'm like, that guy's a fucking animal.
*  This is a different kind of comedy.
*  That was the first seeds in my head that I had of doing comedy.
*  That's amazing.
*  I got to see him live at Great Woods.
*  I saw Bon Jovi there.
*  I saw, fuck, I saw everybody.
*  I quit the night Neil Young was there, and they had a riot.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  In New England, huh?
*  Well, the lawn.
*  You know how Mansfield, Great Woods has that lawn out there?
*  It was cold out, and people were starting fires on the lawn.
*  They were starting these little bonfires.
*  We had to break up the fires, and then brawl started breaking out.
*  I always knew that this job was like, what, did you get paid like $20 an hour?
*  I'm not going to fight somebody for $20 an hour.
*  This is crazy.
*  I always carried a hoodie with me.
*  I had my security shirt, and then as soon as shit would go south, I put the hoodie on.
*  I'm out of here.
*  That's what I did.
*  That night, I quit.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I quit the night.
*  That's funny, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  It's $20 to get in a full-on brawl.
*  Yeah, there was brawls breaking out left and right.
*  The first night I was there, I watched one of the security guys beat this guy with a
*  walkie-talkie.
*  I was like, Jesus, what did I sign up for?
*  This is a crazy job.
*  Some guy had stole one of the golf carts, and there was this dude named Alley Cat who
*  was the head of security there.
*  Alley Cat tackled this guy, and he's beating him in the head with a walkie-talkie.
*  Wow, man.
*  I was like, whoa, okay, what did I sign up for?
*  Did you get in fights after you learned your shit?
*  No.
*  No?
*  That's cool.
*  No.
*  I avoided them all.
*  That's amazing.
*  I'm not interested in fights.
*  I would like fights where they were planned.
*  Like meeting a guy in a fucking-
*  No.
*  Like tournaments and stuff.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That's cool.
*  Kickboxing matches.
*  I do a lot of those, but those to me made sense.
*  Fighting on the street, it's like, no.
*  People have guns.
*  People have knives.
*  This is fucking stupid.
*  Sure.
*  I was always nervous.
*  Yeah.
*  I never felt like ... You get in a fight with someone, and someone hits you in the back
*  of the head with a bat.
*  Also, if you fight someone, that's never the end.
*  They're going to go get their cousins.
*  They're going to get their brother.
*  They're going to try to find you when you're alone.
*  That's true.
*  You don't want that kind of problem in your life.
*  Just move on.
*  Oh, it's so easy to just take whatever they're throwing at you with that's supposed to start
*  the fight just being going, yeah, okay, that makes sense.
*  You're right.
*  I am a piece of shit.
*  I'm going to get out of here now.
*  It all means nothing.
*  It only means something to you if you believe them.
*  Yes, yes.
*  If someone says you're a pussy, you're like, okay.
*  What does that mean?
*  Does this mean anything?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You're just saying words.
*  Until you try to hit me, this is nonsense.
*  It's like, oh, you have a bad opinion of me?
*  Oh, that's okay.
*  I don't really care.
*  Also, I was tired all the time because I was training six, seven days a week.
*  I was like, I don't want to be involved in this stupid shit.
*  Right, yeah.
*  I already worked out today.
*  I can't fight you.
*  I'm very aware of the consequences of violence.
*  By the time I was 21 years old, I had probably seen 40 or 50 people get knocked unconscious.
*  Right.
*  At least.
*  What a terrible sight that is.
*  Probably a lot more than that.
*  I've seen so many people snore.
*  It's just on the ground twitching and snoring.
*  I've seen so much of that.
*  I grew up with that.
*  To me, I was like, I don't want none of that in my life.
*  I don't want to have anything to do with this, especially outside of fighting.
*  Yeah.
*  I've seen people creep floors and shit.
*  Head hitting the ground.
*  Oh.
*  KJ worked with a guy in Long Island when KJ was a bouncer.
*  Right.
*  This guy killed a guy.
*  He punched a guy.
*  The guy fell, hit his head, and died.
*  Now the guy has to go to jail.
*  Now you're working as a bouncer, just like I was working as a security guard in Great
*  Woods.
*  You could have gotten in a fight, hit someone, and now you're in jail.
*  For what?
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so cool.
*  That's so cool you worked at Great Woods, though.
*  That's like the ... What a destination to go to and see so many great fucking bands.
*  You know, it's funny.
*  You said Kinnison.
*  I used to be on MTV when I was young, and we'd go to Daytona Beach.
*  You were on remote control, right?
*  I was on remote control.
*  That's right.
*  Quinn got me on there.
*  Yes.
*  And it was the best.
*  But we went to a spring break, Daytona Beach, and Kinnison was at the height.
*  And I went to ... It was the first guy I saw at an arena, Kinnison and some other bad
*  boys.
*  So some guys, I forget their names, but they opened for ...
*  Probably Carl LeBeau.
*  Yeah, yeah, Carl LeBeau, right?
*  And a couple other guys.
*  They're all kind of really funny, tough bastards.
*  The outlaws of comedy.
*  The outlaws.
*  That's it.
*  That's right.
*  That's what it was.
*  And I saw Kinnison destroy.
*  And it was like ... I saw Rodney at a theater in Florida where it felt like fucking, holy
*  shit, this is a rock show, because it was bam, bam, bam.
*  Yeah, oh, Rodney.
*  You're probably going nuts.
*  Rodney.
*  Rapid fire like a machine gun.
*  Yes.
*  The best Rodney would crush for like eight minutes and then go, I know a lot of fucking
*  jokes baby.
*  And they go, ha!
*  You know?
*  That was so cool, man.
*  But Kinnison too, just took over.
*  I saw him in the moment.
*  It was amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I got to see Kinnison decline too.
*  I got to see the decline, because I saw him a couple of times live.
*  And the last time I saw him live, it was in New Hampshire, and there was not that many
*  people there.
*  I drove to this theater with this girl that I was dating.
*  I was probably 20 at the time.
*  Again, it was before I did comedy.
*  And he was just ... it was already like boozing heavy.
*  Yeah.
*  And it wasn't as good.
*  Right.
*  Because he peaked in 86.
*  I feel like the Kinnison from 86 is probably one of the greatest comedians that ever lived,
*  if not the best.
*  He was a monster.
*  He was a monster.
*  But that guy was doing blow and drinking and hanging out with rock stars and just partying.
*  His brother wrote about it.
*  Did you ever read his brother's book?
*  Brother Sam?
*  His brother Bill.
*  It's a great book.
*  It's a great book.
*  If you're a fan of Stand Up, I tell anybody, go buy that book, because it's a great book.
*  And Bill said that you could see the drop off in Sam's material, because he just stopped
*  writing.
*  He wasn't hungry anymore.
*  He had made it.
*  Because there's this hunger inside of him to make it as a comedian, and that's what
*  led him to be outrageous, do all those jokes about the starving kids in Africa, and all
*  these different jokes he did that were just so outrageous, and that preacher's voice,
*  and that fucking powerful delivery.
*  But then when he made it, man, he got real fat and just drinking every night.
*  Yeah, he was slower.
*  He was wearing the bandana days, the rock star days.
*  It just dropped off.
*  It was like a caricature of Kinnison.
*  That's funny.
*  It just happens.
*  It happens when you're drinking or doing whatever the fuck it was.
*  I got in coke.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  I think that's the one that really like, drain these people.
*  That makes you not think straight.
*  You're definitely all over the place.
*  You can't stay steady with a thought.
*  But I remember I met him a couple times.
*  Paulie, sure, was very tight with him.
*  And I knew Paulie, and I hung out with Kinnison a couple times, but I saw him at the improv.
*  The last time I saw him, and he was a little, he was so sweet.
*  He was so nice to me.
*  And he remembered that we hung a little bit.
*  I was a young fucking dummy, and he was nice to me.
*  He had that glazed, had a few too many in the eyes, but he definitely was, when he walked
*  into the fucking improv that night, every comedian was like, well, holy shit, there
*  he is, the fucking man.
*  That was cool.
*  He changed comedy.
*  He really did, because there was no comedy like that before Kinnison came around.
*  He was a different kind of comedy.
*  It was like all of a sudden, comedy was like, you could yell.
*  He was just a force.
*  And the preacher's voice, that thing that he had, where he had that charisma of being
*  this tent revival preacher.
*  And when he would talk quietly, and all of a sudden blast the shit out.
*  And he was a legend at the store.
*  The store goes through these eras, right?
*  When I got to the store, it was 94.
*  And the Kinnison era had ended, he died, and then there was this big drop off.
*  The store was kind of vacant when I got there in 94.
*  It was weird.
*  The shows would be half empty.
*  Yeah, yeah, they were having problems for a bit.
*  But they all had these stories.
*  All the guys like Harris, Pete, and the guys that were still around, they'd all have these
*  stories about when Kinnison was there.
*  He would perform at midnight.
*  And around 1130, all these rock stars would start showing up, movie stars.
*  They would all go there to see Kinnison.
*  He had the midnight spot.
*  Fucking cool.
*  And they would all go.
*  And I remember thinking, imagine people coming to the Comedy Store just to see you.
*  That must be so insane.
*  That's fucking cool as fuck.
*  Oh, it was the coolest because it was all just word of mouth.
*  This is like 84-ish.
*  Before he popped, everybody just knew about him.
*  Rock, rock, I remember Chris was in Vegas and I went to see him with Nicholson and Jim
*  Brooks.
*  Wow.
*  And we were sitting there and fucking Nicholson was laughing his ass off.
*  And I had that thought you just had.
*  I was just going, fucking rock is so cool.
*  Right.
*  That people fucking fly an hour.
*  Like where is he?
*  Let me go see him.
*  They sit back and laugh.
*  I fucking just going shit rock.
*  You really are fucking stud.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The bring the pain days.
*  Bigger and blacker and bring the pain.
*  Two of the greatest specials of all time.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Flawless.
*  Flawless.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  He's a badass.
*  I talked to Rock yesterday just for like 10 minutes or something and we got really excited
*  about stand up again.
*  I go, you're right.
*  And he goes, I kind of am.
*  He can't stop.
*  And when he was doing his tour, he was like, I need a break.
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  And he did like a fucking year on the road or something.
*  And then he's right back to like, got some ideas.
*  Yeah, I think that's a good way to do it.
*  Take a little break and just refresh your mind so you're not running stale.
*  He did a live special too.
*  His live special was fuck.
*  I loved it.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was also like the build up because of getting slapped by Will Smith and all that
*  crazy shit.
*  I think that was like the best thing that ever happened to him because then he became
*  like wild again.
*  Like his stand up was like outrageous.
*  It was like the rock of old.
*  That night was like watching a fucking Super Bowl.
*  He was just like, what?
*  It's a live event?
*  Holy fuck, what the fuck?
*  And then he was a badass and I think he had some white shit on and he looked cool as fuck
*  and you were waiting for him to talk about it.
*  And then he got to it and he got fucking excited.
*  Well, he didn't talk about it for a while.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Like he would tell people if you think I'm going to talk about it, I'm not.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And he wanted to be ready and he wanted to really think about what he was going to say
*  and how to say it.
*  That's because of where we are in life where anything you say is fucking on the internet
*  the next day.
*  So he's like, I got to be careful and not blow this shit up.
*  Also, they were ruin the bits.
*  People would just tell the bits and it wasn't even ready yet.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Because if you have a life changing event like getting slapped at the Oscars in this
*  most preposterous scenario, the whole thing was preposterous.
*  I think for him it was also a wake up call like, hey, these motherfuckers don't really
*  care about me.
*  In that moment, yeah.
*  Yeah, they didn't protect me.
*  Nobody stopped it.
*  He went back and sat down and then he got an award afterwards.
*  He got a standing ovation.
*  What the fuck is going on here?
*  The whole thing was fucking weird.
*  Yeah, because you always want to be that guy who's hosting the Oscars and who's starring
*  in the big movies.
*  That's what everybody wanted.
*  Everybody wanted to be the big movie star.
*  But then you realize, well, these people are fuckers.
*  What did you do?
*  How did you set this up?
*  How come nobody tackled him?
*  That was a fucking weird moment.
*  Oh, the weirdest.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like a guy just showing his ass.
*  You just pulled your pants down, showed the world your ass.
*  Why did you do that?
*  He probably wakes up in the middle of the night going, why did I do that?
*  The whole thing sucks.
*  Oh, beyond.
*  It was almost like a guy who doesn't know how normal people act thinking, this is what
*  you're supposed to do.
*  It became fucking just went to a place that he couldn't get out of and started it.
*  And still there.
*  He's still there.
*  In everybody's mind, when you see Will Smith, oh, he slapped Chris Rock.
*  Not I Am Legend, not Muhammad Ali, not insanely good movies.
*  The guy's an incredible actor.
*  Absolutely.
*  He's been in so many banger movies.
*  He's a fucking blockbuster movie star.
*  People see him, they go, oh, he slapped Chris Rock.
*  Fuck that guy.
*  Fucking sucks.
*  God damn it.
*  Terrible.
*  It sucks, man.
*  It fucking, yeah, it follows you around.
*  It sucks.
*  But my man Rock and the Kinnisons and that shit, when you spread it, that happens once
*  every fucking eight years or something where somebody becomes this shit.
*  Every now and then, someone pops through and it elevates all of us.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to see it, I'd go, oh my God, I want to be better.
*  I want to write more.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  When I used to see Chris at the store, whenever Chris would come in and he would do a set,
*  I'd watch and I'd be like, oh my God.
*  I remember one time I was fucking in the back of the room and this comic stood in front
*  like while I was watching Chris.
*  He's like, dude, I got to get on your podcast.
*  I'm like, you got to get the fuck away from me.
*  I'm watching Chris Rock.
*  Why aren't you watching Chris Rock?
*  He's one of the greats and he's on stage right now and you're talking to me.
*  Holy shit.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  That's so funny, man.
*  I'm going to be on my podcast this day.
*  I'm like, get out of here.
*  You ruined the moment.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  Dude, he, Rock, never wasted a fucking minute on stage.
*  Always trying shit out, always, either notebook or just trying to remember or whatever.
*  Never fucking got tense with the crowd.
*  Just like, they're not liking this, but I'm liking it, so I'm going to keep going.
*  Well, he would do this thing where he would go on stage and he would just have raw premises
*  and he was so comfortable with total silence where it wasn't going well and then he would
*  catch fire and then start killing.
*  And then they're like, oh, it is Chris Rock.
*  He was using them as a sounding board and he would tell them, I'm practicing.
*  I remember one time he went on, somebody fucking killed, and he went on and the first thing
*  he said, hold on, relax, it ain't going to be that funny.
*  They told him it's not going to be that funny.
*  Exactly.
*  I'm working on some shit, but that's how you develop a monster hour.
*  You have to start off with building a structure and get a foundation.
*  Even your first night of the tour, by the last night you go, now that's my act now.
*  The friends who saw you the first two nights, you're like, fuck, I wish you would have seen
*  me fucking.
*  Right.
*  A couple weeks later I figured out that bit.
*  You don't want anybody to see you when you're doing a workout set.
*  Get the fuck out of here.
*  This is a workout set.
*  This could be terrible.
*  This could end badly.
*  Especially when a buddy sees you, you get like that.
*  What a feeling.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no dismount here.
*  It's interesting how those guys, like a guy like Rock or Kinnison or Louie or anybody who's
*  just really killing it.
*  It elevates everybody around you.
*  Everybody gets a little better because of that because you get inspired.
*  I think Rock was on stage and just killed one time.
*  I remember Jon Stewart who was probably 24 at the time.
*  I think I was like 18 or 20 or whatever our age difference is.
*  Jon Stewart goes, I quit.
*  He was just like, God damn, that's good, man.
*  That's what Eric Clapton said when he saw Jimi Hendrix.
*  Yeah.
*  He saw Jimi Hendrix.
*  He's like, what am I doing?
*  What the fuck am I doing?
*  You feel like a phony after you see you got great shit.
*  Especially a guy like Hendrix that comes along and he's doing something completely different
*  than everybody else.
*  Everybody else is playing guitar.
*  They're all great.
*  Then all of a sudden this guy comes on.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  I know.
*  Oh, that was a nasty one.
*  When I work with Phil Hartman, he told me a story when he was 18 years old.
*  He worked at the whiskey.
*  They had those stage monitors.
*  Sometimes the stage monitors, the artists would accidentally kick them and they would
*  go into the crowd.
*  His job was this because they were, you ever been to whiskey?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Small stage, not that big.
*  He'd have to stand there to be prepared to catch the speaker.
*  Hendrix was right there.
*  Where you are to me, Hendrix was.
*  He was 18 years old.
*  He said, dude, it was insane.
*  Phil could play a little guitar too, but he was watching.
*  I'm watching literally the greatest guitarist of all time.
*  He's three feet away from me.
*  That's fucking cool, man.
*  Insane.
*  Phil did all the album covers and shit.
*  I have one of them out here.
*  One of them framed.
*  One of his album covers.
*  He did a bunch.
*  He's a great artist.
*  He was a very interesting guy.
*  He could do so many different things.
*  He made me feel like such a fraud because he would study his lines and he would have
*  little post-it tabs, little different colored ones for different scenes.
*  He'd have notes and all these different things.
*  He would prepare for them.
*  He'd be preparing the mirror.
*  I was like, God.
*  He was the pro for sure.
*  Such a pro with everything.
*  When we were doing the show, he was getting his pilot's license.
*  Every day in between scenes, he would be reading these pilot's manuals.
*  He was so dedicated to something.
*  I lived in the same apartment building when I was on SNL as Phil.
*  Oh, wow.
*  I'd see him.
*  We'd go up on the elevators together and talk about shit.
*  Of course, he was older, so you were just excited that he'd be talking to you.
*  He was a cool motherfucker.
*  I remember the first day on the set of News Radio.
*  I couldn't even believe he was really there.
*  I was looking over across the table.
*  I was like, how did I get on this fucking show?
*  I had zero acting.
*  I did this one.
*  How did you get it?
*  The craziest story.
*  The whole thing's crazy.
*  I did MTV half-hour comedy hour.
*  We'd do whatever, five, seven minutes.
*  Who was the host?
*  Joiner?
*  Yeah, Mario Joiner.
*  I did MTV half-hour comedy hour.
*  I got a development deal out of nowhere for MTV.
*  MTV was offering me a development deal.
*  My manager started saying it was very little money.
*  It was like $500.
*  They were going to lock me up for three years.
*  It was crazy low money.
*  It was so stupid.
*  But you would join them.
*  But I was thinking about doing it.
*  You want me?
*  Let's do it.
*  I was thinking about doing it because this is after Remote Control and they'd made Dennis
*  Leary famous.
*  Yes.
*  They had decided they were going to lock people up to deals now because Leary got famous off
*  that and then he took off and then went away from MTV.
*  I see.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They had decided that they were going to lock up talent.
*  If I did this pilot, if the pilot got picked up, I would have been there.
*  My manager said, he said, I have an idea.
*  He decided to send my MTV tape out to all these studios and say, this guy's about to
*  sign a development deal for MTV, locked up, but he's still available.
*  Then I started getting all these phone calls.
*  People would call my apartment.
*  I was at home like, hello?
*  They're like, hi, this is Bob Bob Bob from Universal.
*  We want to get you on a plane right now to Los Angeles.
*  I was like, what?
*  Wow.
*  I was like, hey, dude, these fucking people are calling my apartment.
*  He goes, don't answer your phone.
*  He goes, go to the pool hall.
*  Don't answer the phone.
*  And he goes, just leave it all to me.
*  Within three weeks, I had this crazy deal for $150,000, which is the most money I'd
*  ever even heard of in my life.
*  All of a sudden, I was in Hollywood, out of nowhere.
*  What was the deal with CBS?
*  It was with Disney.
*  Wow.
*  Which is crazy because I was filthy.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  All of a sudden, I have a deal with Disney.
*  I'm on this Fox sitcom.
*  I had to get acting lessons.
*  I took a few acting lessons.
*  I hated it.
*  I was like, this is gross.
*  I knew how to just pretend.
*  I pretend on stage.
*  Sitcom acting is pretty easy.
*  All of a sudden, I'm on this sitcom.
*  It gets canceled.
*  I'm like, oh, I was thinking about moving back to New York.
*  I was like, I hated LA.
*  I hated being around actors.
*  You couldn't joke around with them.
*  They were all so sensitive.
*  Everybody was on pills.
*  They were all on antidepressants.
*  They were like, get me out of here.
*  I can't deal with it.
*  I want to go back to comics.
*  Yeah.
*  I was ready to move back to New York, but I had got this fucking apartment.
*  I thought that the sitcom was going to go, so I got a lease on this beautiful apartment
*  in North Hollywood.
*  I had a loft and a pool table.
*  I thought I was balling.
*  I was making like 20 grand a week.
*  I was like, this is amazing.
*  That's fucking big.
*  It was crazy.
*  I was like, I'm rich.
*  I got this apartment.
*  I'm like, wow, I have this apartment.
*  I can't just leave the apartment.
*  What the fuck do I do?
*  Then I got another development deal.
*  So I'd gone to two auditions in my entire life.
*  One of them was Hardball, got that show.
*  The other one was News Radio.
*  I got that show.
*  That's fucking crazy.
*  It made no sense.
*  Made no sense.
*  And all of a sudden I'm sitting there and I'm sitting across from Phil Hartman.
*  I'm like, this is crazy.
*  That's a biggie.
*  I had full imposter syndrome.
*  And that show fucking kept going for a while.
*  News Radio was big.
*  No, it wasn't.
*  It wasn't?
*  I thought it was, isn't that Brillstein Gray?
*  No.
*  It was big until after it was canceled.
*  Oh, I see.
*  And then it went into syndication.
*  How many years did it?
*  Five years.
*  That's pretty good.
*  Yeah, but it became really big in syndication.
*  I see, I see.
*  Four years or five?
*  I think we did five years.
*  We did like 98 shows.
*  Who else was on it?
*  I forget all of a sudden.
*  Maura Tierney.
*  She was great.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Dave Foley, amazing.
*  That's right.
*  Andy Dick.
*  And that's how I met Farley, through Andy.
*  And then Candy Alexander, she was awesome.
*  Vicki Lewis, Steven Root, amazing.
*  All right.
*  So it was a great cast.
*  I felt like a fraud.
*  I was like, all these people have like background in theater and background in films, movies
*  and TV shows.
*  And I was just like, this dirty kid.
*  Phil made everybody feel that way.
*  Everybody was kind of like, well, he's the next level.
*  Oh, he was the next level.
*  And he was so good.
*  Him and Steven Root was so good, too.
*  He was the only one that wasn't even himself.
*  Everybody else was just being a version of Steven Root.
*  And he was a different human.
*  Yeah.
*  He was a sweet, normal guy.
*  And then he would play Jimmy James.
*  And he would just fall into this character.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  He had a character just like when he was in office space.
*  Yeah, unbelievable.
*  Yeah.
*  So he's worshiped too.
*  Yeah.
*  Bizarre being on that show because I was 26, 27 when I was on the show.
*  Making big money, wow.
*  But it was also confusing.
*  I felt like such an imposter.
*  I was like, someone's going to figure out that I don't belong here.
*  That's funny.
*  And then I'm going to have to go get a job.
*  That's nice, though.
*  That's a good person to be feeling like that.
*  I think I was a cocky fuck who was like, yeah, baby.
*  They figured it out.
*  I'm here.
*  But I literally didn't get shit growing up.
*  I auditioned for shit and never got nobody like me.
*  Really?
*  Every audition, they were just like, I would talk to my agent after and be like, nervously
*  asking, what they say, you know?
*  And then they'd have to be, did you read the sides before?
*  I'd be like, what do you mean?
*  That's what they said?
*  Of course I read the sides.
*  They were like, I thought you didn't know it that well.
*  I go, what?
*  I thought I knew it real well.
*  They didn't like it?
*  Do you think that you're, they would use words to kind of be gentle with me, but just say
*  you're not ready yet.
*  Well, it's funny how you have confidence when you're young and you really do think that
*  you're ready.
*  I remember thinking that at open mic nights.
*  You'd see someone on stage and they were bomb.
*  God, I wish I could go up there.
*  Well, that was terrible.
*  I would have bumped too.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Yes.
*  Or watching another actor and you go, when you were young and you see someone your age
*  on a show, you'd be like, what's with the white?
*  I could fucking crush that shit.
*  And then you realize looking back, oh, that guy was pretty fucking good.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, News Radio was fortunate because I got to play like a more retarded version of myself.
*  It was like basically like in a lot of conspiracy theories and delusional.
*  It was like a version of me.
*  The writers are very smart.
*  Did they know that?
*  Yeah, they were writing it that way.
*  I see.
*  Figured me out after a while and started writing stuff in.
*  That's funny.
*  I talked to them about fucking UFO projects.
*  Wow, man.
*  Top secret shit.
*  And then they put all that kind of stuff in the script.
*  That's cool.
*  Because I was into stupid things.
*  It was fascinating.
*  You got into that shit real young.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Alone in your head or you had somebody who brought it up to you and you started going
*  with that?
*  Conspiracies?
*  A friend of mine who was in a band gave me a book once on the road and it was a book
*  called Best Evidence by this guy David Lifton.
*  It's all about the Kennedy assassination.
*  He's like, you got to read this.
*  The government killed Kennedy.
*  I was like, what?
*  I'm going to read this book.
*  Going, what the fuck?
*  I read this book.
*  It was just really funny.
*  And I went on stage after I read it and bombed.
*  And I apologized to the club owner.
*  I was like, look, man, I'm funnier than that.
*  I read this fucking book.
*  And they're like, don't read it tomorrow.
*  I got to promise I'm not going to read it tomorrow.
*  Tomorrow night I killed.
*  And I killed the next night because I put the book down.
*  You got to be.
*  I didn't bomb terrible, but it was flat.
*  It wasn't good.
*  I was in a weird head space.
*  I was like, Jesus Christ, they killed the president.
*  I was like, this is nuts.
*  That's funny, man.
*  Wow.
*  It fucked you up.
*  It fucked me up.
*  And then it got me down this conspiracy spiral.
*  So I started questioning things.
*  I was like, what else don't I know?
*  I started reading about all kinds of different things that I didn't know.
*  That's fucking amazing.
*  I read this book called The Strange Death of Vince Foster.
*  It's all Vince Foster, a guy who worked with Clinton who got murdered.
*  They said it was a suicide.
*  He had the gun in his hand.
*  There was less blood at the crime scene than was missing from his body.
*  It seemed like his body had been transported to the crime scene.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Those things will fuck you up.
*  Fascinating shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, reading books like that, and your head gets filled with that kind of shit.
*  You know, Quinn was like that, too.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Quinn read a lot of shit, and he would tell me to read stuff.
*  And I remember he knew a lot about crazy mass murderers and shit.
*  And I would start going, what happened?
*  And he would tell me these things.
*  And I remember telling my dad some of the shit Quinn told me about.
*  I don't remember who.
*  But I'd be like, and then this guy, and blah, blah, blah, and Ted Bundy, and this and that.
*  And my father started getting like, is my son a fucking murderer?
*  Why is he talking so much about murderers?
*  Joey Diaz gave me this book called Murder Machine once.
*  It's about Roy DeMeo.
*  You know Roy DeMeo?
*  He was a serial killer who worked for the mob.
*  And he would kill people.
*  They had a bar downstairs, and they had an apartment upstairs.
*  He would kill people, and then cut them up in the bathtub upstairs, and just killed a
*  bunch of fucking people.
*  It's a horrific book.
*  Right.
*  And I remember reading that going, Jesus fucking...
*  There's no one that there's people like that out there in the world.
*  Oh, it's terrifying.
*  Oh my God.
*  And you just get in the wrong fucking place at the wrong time.
*  Wrong guy shows up at your house.
*  Oh boy.
*  Oh boy.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  It was just like, those things are terrible to read before you go on stage, though.
*  Fuck your brain up.
*  That's so funny that you ate it because of that book, man.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I've eaten it a couple times because I did the wrong thing before I went on stage.
*  One time I had a gig in New Jersey, and it was a college.
*  It was a weird place to get to.
*  It was back in the day before navigation, so they would give you the directions over
*  the phone.
*  You get fucked up.
*  Like, go to 405, get off this exit.
*  They give me the directions.
*  I leave early because they tell me it's really hard to get to, and I get there about a half
*  hour early.
*  But it was hard to get.
*  I was like, Jesus Christ, this place is hard to find.
*  I was working with JB Smooth.
*  Wow.
*  JB was supposed to open, and I was supposed to close.
*  They said, JB's not here yet, so why don't you just relax in the rec room and sit down,
*  and we'll tell you when the show's going to start.
*  I sit down, and I'm watching this documentary on the Malibu fires.
*  All these people, people lost their family, lost their house.
*  The house is a part of this little kid walking around looking for his dog.
*  Rusty, where are you, Rusty?
*  Oh, fuck you up.
*  Rusty.
*  Yelling for their dog.
*  Your dog's dead.
*  There's this fireman who was just weeping and crying because the people in this community
*  lost his house.
*  Then they come in the green room, and they go, look, JB's not here yet, so we're going
*  to have you open up.
*  Oh my God.
*  Hopefully, when you get off stage, he's going to go up and be like, okay.
*  I'm crying.
*  I was literally crying watching this thing about these people losing everything in these
*  fires.
*  It was horrific.
*  Oh my God.
*  I went on stage and just ate shit.
*  That's terrible.
*  Then finally, JB shows up, and he showed up, and he went on after me and murdered.
*  He was loose and happy and relaxed.
*  He came in the right mood, didn't watch that shit.
*  He's a killer anyway.
*  He's very funny anyway.
*  I remember thinking, God, you can't do that.
*  I was with my girlfriend at the time, and she was so disappointed in me.
*  Wow.
*  What was wrong with you?
*  She's seen you killed before.
*  Yeah, she knew I was funny.
*  She's like, what was wrong with you?
*  I go, watch that fucking thing.
*  I have similar ... It's not from watching something.
*  I have moments where I'm driving to a club, and I'm in this fucking mood where I'm going,
*  oh my God, I ain't going to fucking destroy it.
*  I have such a ... The last two hours have been in the right mood.
*  Maybe some fucking song comes on.
*  I'm like, fuck that.
*  Fuck me up a little bit, that song.
*  Then I walk in, then I'm in this fucking weird mood.
*  I'm a little down.
*  I get on stage.
*  All of a sudden, I let the crowd own me.
*  I'm like, what the fuck happened?
*  I was so ready to kill tonight, and I fucking turned into ...
*  Yeah, you're in the car.
*  Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone.
*  That's a good one.
*  Oh no.
*  Oh no.
*  Oh yeah, man.
*  Susan, the plans they may put in ... Why am I here?
*  You get sad.
*  You can't get sad before you go on stage.
*  You got to protect your mind.
*  My wife helps me out sometimes when she sees my head spinning before I go up.
*  She goes, they're here to see you.
*  They're here to see you.
*  Oh, that's good.
*  They like you.
*  You don't have to worry so much.
*  I'll be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Okay, they're here for the good time.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not testing you.
*  Go have some fun with them.
*  I go, yeah, no, no, no.
*  You're right.
*  You're right.
*  Then I go, fuck, let me go on happy.
*  The times I go on fucked up and being like, this guy's going to like me or am I going
*  to have to fight?
*  I'm like, I have fucked up over that.
*  That's why to me, one of the things I've realized early on is take people on the road with you.
*  In the early days, when I was headlining, they would have a local middle act and a local
*  opener.
*  Sometimes it'd be fun.
*  Sometimes it'd be terrible.
*  Sometimes it got to be a douche bag.
*  Yeah.
*  Why are you fucking closing?
*  Exactly.
*  They would step on your material.
*  They'd see your set first night and then they'd cover the same subject.
*  Holy shit.
*  They'd have to argue with them.
*  Why are you doing it?
*  Hey man, you're doing one of my fucking bits.
*  No man, I've been doing that bit.
*  Fuck you.
*  There was a lot of sabotage going on.
*  It just wasn't fun because then you'd be stuck in this town.
*  You didn't know anybody there.
*  You're just watching TV, go to the movies by yourself.
*  In the condo.
*  It was depressing.
*  I realized if you could go on the road with funny people, you're going to have fun.
*  It's good for them because they get a gig.
*  I'd just have to pay the opening act and I'd have to pay for their airfare.
*  I would make less money, but I would have more fun.
*  I was like, more fun is more important than anything.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's more important for the show too.
*  You go up in the right frame always.
*  I know that the comics in front of me are going to be really good.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to be a good show.
*  I want the audience to have fun, but I want to have fun too.
*  Then it was a party.
*  Then I'd be on the road with Joey Diaz and we'd be having a party everywhere we go.
*  He's funny.
*  We'd be just having fun.
*  It became family.
*  Wherever we were, it didn't matter if we were in Ohio or New Jersey, it was us.
*  Daytime is fun.
*  Have dinner together, then go fucking do your shit, then stay up all night.
*  I know.
*  Joey was such a wild card.
*  This is back in the Joey cocaine days.
*  This is Coco, Joey Coco.
*  I brought a second opening act in case Joey didn't show up.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That makes some sense.
*  Because sometimes I didn't want to tell him he couldn't do the gigs, hey, you're not reliable.
*  I loved him.
*  The times that he's there are so magic.
*  I want to make sure that he knows he's always got a gig.
*  What a fucking funny one.
*  Sometimes I'd book him and we'd do Friday and Saturday.
*  Then I'd call him on Sunday.
*  I'd go, hey, the show's at 7 o'clock.
*  I'm going back home.
*  What are you talking about?
*  You know I don't do Sundays.
*  What are you talking about?
*  You don't do Sundays.
*  I don't do show rogues.
*  I don't do Sundays.
*  You never told me you don't do Sundays.
*  You're springing that on me, man.
*  We have a show in an hour.
*  I told you.
*  Yeah.
*  So having a third opening act or a second opening act would be perfect.
*  And you'd say you've got to do longer.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  What would be like, I'd bring Ari.
*  So if it was me and Ari Shaffir, it's like, okay, Ari does 25 minutes and then I'll do
*  an hour and 15 or whatever and we got a great show.
*  Yeah, man.
*  If Joey shows up, okay, ground, now we got a three-man show.
*  Funny, man.
*  Perfect.

*  I love that.
*  But, fucking learned from seeing these superstar guys on the road fucking have fun.
*  Isn't it funny how sometimes those guys always think of you as that guy?
*  The relationships are the same.
*  Exactly.
*  They're still like, hey, what's up?
*  They're like, I know you fucking went on.
*  I remember when you sucked.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Which is why you have to get out of your hometown.
*  And you talk back to them.
*  Yeah.
*  You talk, I still let them own me, these guys.
*  I'm like, all right, you did see me suck.
*  You're right.
*  That's why you have to get out of your town.
*  Because they always remember you as an open mic'er.
*  Hell yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't get any headlining gigs in Boston.
*  Wow.
*  Where did you play?
*  You played Stitches?
*  Stitches, Nick's Commie Stop, Connection.
*  Connection.
*  What a room.
*  It was a great room.
*  Fucking incredible.
*  The little one was the best.
*  That tight, low ceiling.
*  Yeah, yeah, low ceiling.
*  That's the one I...
*  150 seats.
*  Yeah.
*  It was packed.
*  Stuffed in there.
*  Bumper to bumper.
*  It was packed.
*  It was amazing.
*  Play It Again Sam's, was that it?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, I did play it again Sam's.
*  That place was great.
*  What was the one that was a Chinese restaurant?
*  Kowloon in Saugus.
*  In Saugus, Harry Brown.
*  Yeah.
*  When the Ding Ho was the big one.
*  Ding Ho.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I wasn't there for that one.
*  Oh, I think that's the one I did.
*  That place went under a few years before I started.
*  Uh-huh.
*  When I came around, I had missed the heyday of Boston Commie.
*  It was like 84.
*  And I came around in 88.
*  That's when I started.
*  Gotcha.
*  Okay, yeah.
*  I did.
*  And there was all these killers like Lenny Clark.
*  All these guys from the Ding Ho.
*  Didn't fuck with Lenny Clark.
*  A lot of Tony B.
*  Tony B.
*  Some of these guys, you just couldn't fucking.
*  You just would watch them go, how the fuck can I kill like that?
*  Well those guys had, as you said, they had the same act for like 15 years.
*  And that act was like hammered down like a samurai sword.
*  It was so tight.
*  Oh it was great.
*  Like Don Gavin.
*  So tight.
*  You'd see his act.
*  Like Jesus Christ, this guy would murder.
*  And Tommy Sledge.
*  Do you remember?
*  He pretended to be a private eye.
*  I backed off.
*  I moved on.
*  Oh yeah.
*  But he was funny as shit.
*  Some of those guys.
*  Some of those guys.
*  And some of those ladies, man, they murdered.
*  And yeah.
*  Did you ever see that documentary when Stand Up stood out?
*  No.
*  Fran Salamita made this great documentary about the heyday of Boston comedy.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Called When Stand Up Stood Out.
*  Right, right, right.
*  And then there's a transition between these guys being these local comics that were as
*  good as anyone in the world.
*  And then Steven Wright becomes famous.
*  And then Steven Wright gets on Tonight Show.
*  He becomes this world, was it Letterman or Tonight Show that he first did?
*  I forget what it was.
*  But he became huge.
*  And then they're all now, everyone's like scrambling.
*  Like what did we do?
*  Like we didn't have an act that translated outside of Boston.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Back then it was very Boston.
*  Very, very local.
*  Steven Wright definitely, in my high school, holy shit, everybody knew every, it was like
*  Rodney.
*  He was like right after Rodney.
*  Yeah.
*  You'd repeat his jokes.
*  You couldn't believe it.
*  And everyone was like, he's fucking so smart.
*  I used to work at a fire hydrant factory.
*  You couldn't park anywhere near the place.
*  Yeah.
*  Unbelievable.
*  Ridiculous.
*  I think I tried to write like him in the beginning.
*  I think I, as a stand up, did like 10 different guys.
*  I didn't know who I wanted.
*  Right.
*  I was doing like Bobcat kind of shit.
*  I'd do a character.
*  I didn't know what the fuck.
*  But Steven Wright, we'd always, me and my buddy, we'd kind of try to write in that vein
*  of a little weird and make you think, and what a cool joke.
*  I don't fucking know.
*  But I also remember all those guys got popped by the IRS.
*  Because they were-
*  Stand ups?
*  Yeah.
*  They all got popped.
*  Because none of them were paying taxes.
*  They were all getting paid cash.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And so they all got in trouble.
*  I remember working at Nick's Comedy Stomp.
*  They offered you could get paid in cash or in coke.
*  Yeah, yeah, I remember those days.
*  That's how wild those days were.
*  And so these guys were just animals.
*  They were all getting paid cash.
*  They were drinking and partying every night.
*  And they were headlining.
*  And there's one time during the heyday where Nick's Comedy Stomp had three rooms running
*  simultaneously.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'd have two shows a night in each room.
*  So these guys would do six sets.
*  And they were making bank.
*  And they all had a deal.
*  The way Nick's had them set up where they were Nick's Comics exclusives.
*  So they would just work for Nick's.
*  But they gave you so much work.
*  Yeah.
*  You didn't want to branch out.
*  They booked the road too, right?
*  They had a few road gigs.
*  I remember Bill Downs was-
*  Oh yeah, Connection.
*  He used to book me on the road too.
*  I worked for a private investigator when I was starting out when I was an open mic'er.
*  And this private investigator was Bill Downs' cousin.
*  I didn't find out about until after I started working for him.
*  To this day, one of the funniest guys I've ever met in my life just never did stand up.
*  His name was Dick Dolan.
*  Dave Dolan, rather.
*  He'd call himself Dynamite Dickless Dave Dolan.
*  Dickless Dave.
*  He was fucking hilarious.
*  I have a phone that I- he died a couple years back.
*  But I have a phone that I saved.
*  And I'll never get rid of it because it's got a voicemail on that phone from him where
*  he called me up.
*  It was like I did a gig in Boston.
*  I hung out with him.
*  I was like, hey Joe.
*  He was just a Boston character.
*  Just a hilarious dude.
*  And he was cousins with Bill Downs.
*  Funny man.
*  Bill Downs, what a guy.
*  That guy used to book me all the time.
*  Even though, even when I would do bad, he'd be like, I heard it didn't go that good.
*  I'd be like, yeah.
*  And in my head, I'm like, okay, it's over.
*  Big guy.
*  He'd call you big guy.
*  Hey big guy.
*  I heard it didn't go that good, big guy.
*  Yeah, right, right, right.
*  Yes, I know.
*  But then he'd fucking get me another gig.
*  In Quincy, there was some place in Quincy, I forget the name of that, The Naughty Pine.
*  Did you ever work for Dick Doherty?
*  I don't think so.
*  You never did Dick Doherty's comedy huts?
*  I don't think so.
*  Dick Doherty, he called himself the godfather of Boston comedy.
*  Oh, okay.
*  He had a bunch of terrible gigs.
*  Was that like 88 on?
*  Yeah, 88 on.
*  I fucking was in the scene in Boston more from 84 to 88.
*  Okay, so you were in the heyday.
*  So you got there like right.
*  I got there and it was huge.
*  I wasn't great.
*  But then, buddy, all of a sudden, I got on Saturday Night Live, I don't know, 89 or something.
*  And those same guys would come see me.
*  All of a sudden, I got big in the colleges.
*  And I was doing these fucking giant shows back then.
*  It was unbelievable, you know, 2000, 3000, 5000 seats.
*  And the guys that I used to eat it in front of would come do the gigs with me.
*  And they'd watch me and they'd be like, that fucking loser is killing now?
*  The fuck did that happen?
*  Because again, the thing when they see you in the beginning, they never respect you.
*  Right, right.
*  They remember you sucking.
*  Yeah, they were right.
*  They were right back then.
*  But it's hard for people to accept that you grew.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is weird.
*  That's true.
*  That's true.
*  Because I'm fucking pro athletes.
*  Like Jordan fucking wasn't the man for a while.
*  Right.
*  He got cut from his high school team, right?
*  Exactly.
*  That shit's gonna happen in every profession that you just gotta figure out what you're
*  – you just gotta practice.
*  Did you always want to be on SNL or was it something that came up?
*  I didn't even know it.
*  It wasn't the thought.
*  I wanted to be a movie star.
*  I was cocky and telling my friends in college, I'm not gonna be a fucking movie star.
*  They'd be like, why?
*  Why would you be a movie star?
*  Look at you.
*  You got fucking – and I'd be like, you don't get it, man.
*  And I thought I was good looking too.
*  I thought I was good looking.
*  Like now I go, how the fuck did I think – I know I'm normal looking, but I thought there
*  was something fucking attractive about me that people are gonna be like, that's a fucking
*  stud right there.
*  And no, I – then I think I was doing stand-up.
*  Dennis Miller said good shit about me to SNL people.
*  And then Sandy Wernick was my manager and he knew all of them and they got me an audition.
*  And then I did it and then they hired me as – asked me to be a writer and I remember
*  saying to Hurley who knew more about SNL – I didn't watch SNL that much.
*  I was kind of lost.
*  They were like, it's really good.
*  Dana Carvey's incredible.
*  I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's great.
*  He's great.
*  And they were like – and I was like, but I kind of want to get in the movies.
*  And they were like – and my buddies were like, you should do SNL if there's that choice,
*  you know?
*  So you were thinking about not doing it?
*  Well, I wasn't sure.
*  I wasn't sure.
*  I was kind of like, let's see.
*  Wow.
*  Let's see.
*  I'm not a writer, so why am I gonna become a writer?
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  I'm not even that fucking good at that.
*  What was the audition like?
*  What did you have to do?
*  I ended up in Chicago improv.
*  It was me, Rock, Dana Gould, and a couple other guys.
*  And I did decent, and the SNL people thought I wrote some funny shit.
*  Lauren thought I wrote some funny shit.
*  Robert Smigel thought I had some shit, and then I got on.
*  Wow.
*  And Spade was on.
*  How old were you?
*  I was 23.
*  Whoa.
*  Yes, that was big.
*  That's nuts.
*  That's as cool as it gets.
*  What was that feeling like?
*  All of a sudden it became like you were in a rock band, because Farley got on and rock
*  and Spade and we would walk down the street and Schneider and Norm and Tim Meadows.
*  We were just always together.
*  So there was this crazy band confidence.
*  Wow.
*  If anyone talks shit about the show, we were at a restaurant, like, it wasn't that good
*  this Saturday.
*  We were just like, shut the fuck up, man.
*  We were fucking ready.
*  Because there were so many of us.
*  But then when you were alone and somebody says, I saw you, you're kind of like, huh,
*  yeah.
*  There's something cool about having a bunch of guys with you.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's confidence.
*  Yeah, you got a team.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  23.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  What was it like when it was popping?
*  Because you were on a great era of SNL, too.
*  Look at that fucking cast.
*  Yes.
*  Harbin, Tim Meadows.
*  Look at that fucking cast.
*  Oh, fucking everyone.
*  Look at how young Spade looks and rock.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Cute, yeah.
*  Al Franken.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Look at that cast.
*  That's when he was in the cast that year.
*  Wow.
*  Neelon, everybody loved.
*  Everybody loved.
*  And Ellen, Claghorne, I knew from the comic strip.
*  Wow.
*  And Melanie and Julia.
*  All cool.
*  All cool.
*  Very tight.
*  But we all love Neelon.
*  Every comedian loves Neelon.
*  Everybody liked the way he dropped jokes in and fucking smooth as hell.
*  Isn't it crazy looking at yourself back then?
*  I fucking don't know what I was thinking.
*  Spade sent me a fucking skit we did like six months ago, and I was like, this is the first
*  time this ever happened, Spade.
*  I don't fucking remember that one ounce.
*  I didn't even know what that thing was about.
*  I don't remember what it was, but I go, I didn't remember saying any of those words.
*  I didn't know what the jokes were.
*  I didn't know what the fucking ending was.
*  And he's like, you don't?
*  So I don't fucking remember that one.
*  You did?
*  He goes, I sort of did.
*  But it was weird.
*  That's how I know I've been doing this so fucking long that this shit.
*  I know I've been doing this shit long when somebody comes up to me, a big famous motherfucker,
*  and we go, hey man, I go, hey, nice to meet you.
*  And he's like, nice to meet you.
*  We met.
*  And I'm like, I fucking didn't remember meeting you?
*  What the fuck happened?
*  Well your brain gets overwhelmed with people.
*  You know that number, Dunbar's number?
*  Do you know what that is?
*  No.
*  Dunbar's number is a principle that you can only keep like 150 people in your head at
*  any given time.
*  And then there's some people that you can keep kind of in a distance, like acquaintances.
*  But there's like a tight group of a small number.
*  And then as it branches out, it gets to like 150.
*  Everything after that is very sketchy.
*  And when you're famous, you're constantly meeting people, which is very unusual for
*  human beings.
*  Also very unusual that they know you, but you don't know them.
*  So there's this weird thing.
*  But you go, nice to meet you.
*  Like we met.
*  Oh, I forgot.
*  Sorry.
*  It's not like I don't like you.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm not mean.
*  I got hit with a bunch of them today.
*  Yeah.
*  Your brain's overwhelmed with people.
*  There's no room.
*  You don't have room.
*  Remember the old phones where you could only keep like 100 contacts?
*  That's all the phone.
*  It had like one fucking little tiny hard drive.
*  Once you got over a certain, nobody keeps 100 people on your phone.
*  That's all it could take.
*  And that's how your brain is.
*  Your brain doesn't have room for all these people.
*  So it's not even your fault.
*  It's like your brain's not designed to be famous.
*  No one's brain is designed.
*  Never thought of it like that.
*  That's what it is.
*  That's great.
*  And then when you've done so many things, like as many things as you have, it's just
*  normal that you're going to forget.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  When the pandemic was going on, my kids found out about News Radio.
*  They didn't know about it because I don't talk about your shit.
*  Yeah.
*  They're fucking they're not impressed by me.
*  I got dissed me all the time.
*  They're always cracking jokes.
*  It's fun.
*  It's fun.
*  I don't know about it, but it's fun.
*  But they watched me on News Radio and I watched one of the scenes.
*  I was like, I don't even remember this at all.
*  Right.
*  Oh, you had that too, right?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I didn't remember it at all.
*  Don't remember being there.
*  Don't remember that room.
*  Remember not occasionally.
*  I remember like four or five episodes.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I remember that one.
*  That was a fun episode.
*  That's funny, man.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's weird.
*  Your brain just doesn't have any room for it.
*  It's almost like it's a lie.
*  Like I didn't do that.
*  This is a lie.
*  Oh, my God.
*  This is AI.
*  Not one time have I ever looked back at that shit from 30 years ago and go, whoa, was I
*  good?
*  I'm always like, jeez, what the fuck were you doing?
*  What a fucking horrible performance there.
*  Well, I think that's probably a good sign.
*  That's a sign of a person who's not egocentric.
*  Right, right, right.
*  You kind of have a good sense of who you are.
*  Yeah, yes.
*  I hope so.
*  The people that think everything they did is amazing.
*  You ever go over to someone's house and they want you to watch something that they've done
*  and they're like, don't make me do this.
*  Oh, that's a toughie.
*  Don't make me do this.
*  I'm like, am I real?
*  No.
*  No, that's a roughie.
*  Don't make me watch this.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  You can say to me, you don't want this.
*  Don't do this, man.
*  Don't do this.
*  This is for the best.
*  Also, I'll start shitting on you.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  If you play that, I'm going to start shitting on you.
*  That's funny, man.
*  It's got to be a bizarre feeling to be 23 years old and be on an iconic television show.
*  Oh, man.
*  I'm never more excited to call home and talk to my New Hampshire buddies and be like, I
*  mean, remember all that shit I said that was going to happen?
*  It's fucking happening.
*  I don't have to bullshit right now.
*  It's really going.
*  And then when I would get on the show, say one line, whatever, it was just like my parents,
*  my family, my friends, just like that was so, that was incredible.
*  I would play the busboy or the delivery guy.
*  It's just half a line.
*  It was like, holy shit, you did it.
*  You're on TV, man.
*  My first TV show was Showtime at the Apollo.
*  I did that.
*  That was my first thing I ever did.
*  Wow.
*  And they fucking sent a limo to pick us up.
*  I lived in Chelsea.
*  How old were you then?
*  I think I was 18 or 19.
*  I think it was 18.
*  Whoa.
*  18.
*  That's crazy.
*  Went on and it was the second episode ever of Showtime at the Apollo.
*  The first was Rock and Rock cursed so much that they didn't use his shit.
*  So I was like the first comedian to be on.
*  I fucking, I forget.
*  Shit, the host was a great guy.
*  Is this it?
*  Yes.
*  That's Melba Moore.
*  Adam Sandler.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yes.
*  This one goofy guy.
*  Terrified.
*  Hey, Melba Moore.
*  Jeez, Mel.
*  I want an honor to be here for me.
*  Look at that face.
*  Fucking young dumb.
*  You people are so special.
*  So I take a cab to come here, right?
*  Maybe having a little bad day.
*  I don't know what's happening there.
*  We're driving along and he kills a dork.
*  How painful is this to watch?
*  Hurts.
*  Hurts.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Hit mute.
*  Hit mute.
*  Yeah, no.
*  I fucking, yeah.
*  I can't say I was very good back then, but I had some fucking confidence.
*  What was the first movie you did?
*  First movie I did was pretty awesome.
*  I, 22, moved out to LA.
*  Did stand up at the Improv.
*  It was probably my third time ever.
*  I get off stage.
*  Two or three nice youngsters, director, writers came up to me.
*  Hey, that was good.
*  You want to be in a movie?
*  I said, yeah, for sure.
*  They were like, okay, we're going to make a movie.
*  We're doing a movie on a boat.
*  I said, okay.
*  When?
*  When?
*  Next week we leave.
*  I said, do I have a big part?
*  They go, well, you're the star.
*  I go, okay, cool.
*  So I go home.
*  I tell Judd, I was with all my buddies and Judd comes over and he goes, what happened?
*  They said I can start.
*  He goes, do they have a script?
*  I go, oh, I don't know.
*  I didn't even know there were scripts.
*  I knew nothing about it.
*  And then I just fucking went on a boat for six days and shot this movie.
*  At the time it was called The Unsinkable Shaki Moskowitz, but now it's called Babes
*  Ahoy.
*  And I was 22.
*  Wow.
*  And you were the star of the movie?
*  I was Shaki.
*  Whoa.
*  I don't know how it happened.
*  Milton Berle was in it.
*  Whoa.
*  I had a scene with him.
*  So I got to tell my parents I'm doing great.
*  What was Milton Berle like?
*  Very nice.
*  I heard he shows everybody his cock.
*  It was accidentally seen if I remember that big hog of his fell out of his shorts.
*  He had a monster hog.
*  He had a very great dick.
*  And apparently he would show everybody his hog.
*  Imagine that.
*  Look at you.
*  Yes.
*  By the way, I was in shape then.
*  Yeah, that's Adam.
*  Look at that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's me.
*  Skinny.
*  Yeah, I'd get shut down by a girl there.
*  That's when I was fucking young and happy.
*  22 years old.
*  22.
*  Wow.
*  Thanks for showing that.
*  It's good without volume.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  It's painful to see your young voice.
*  Whenever my kids see that shit, they're like, why did you talk like that?
*  I go, I don't know.
*  I was in acting class at school and I did a scene.
*  I thought I did great.
*  And then they opened it up to the class to say shit.
*  One kid goes, why is he talking like that?
*  And in my head I'm like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?
*  Why did you use that dumb voice?
*  And I was like, what fucking dumb voice?
*  But then I watched it back.
*  Oh, that kid was right, man.
*  Fucking pathetic.
*  What was the first big movie you did?
*  Bobcat Goldthwait made a movie called Shakes the Clown.
*  I remember that movie.
*  That was a great fucking movie.
*  That was exciting.
*  Yeah, that was good.
*  That was the alcoholic clown movie.
*  Exactly.
*  And Bobcat was funny as shit.
*  And he made me and Blake Clark, we were his best friends.
*  And that was it.
*  That was the big time.
*  Wow.
*  Loved it.
*  Shakes the Clown.
*  That movie doesn't get enough love.
*  That was big.
*  That was like, a lot of people liked it when it wasn't a massive hit, but it was cool
*  as shit.
*  It was cool.
*  It was a crazy movie.
*  It was like Bobcat stretching his wings.
*  Is this after Police Academy?
*  I think he did Police Academy first.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow, man.
*  You got every fucking thing ready to go.
*  Julie Brown.
*  Down, down, Julie Brown.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow, man.
*  Yes, yes.
*  There's Bob on the ground.
*  Or I think, there's Bobcat.
*  And Florence Henderson was in it.
*  There he is.
*  Yeah, he knew what he was doing, Bobcat.
*  He knew what a direct.
*  I didn't even know what he was talking about back then.
*  He's like, I'm directing.
*  I was like.
*  Well, he directed the first episodes of The Chappelle Show.
*  He did?
*  Yeah.
*  I was in New York and I was walking down the street and I was doing Carolines for the weekend.
*  And I was just walking down the street and I ran into Bobcat.
*  And I go, hey man, what are you doing?
*  He goes, oh, I'm here with Dave Chappelle.
*  We're doing this show.
*  And I ran into Dave and Dave had a fake mustache on.
*  I go, Dave, what are you doing?
*  He goes, oh, hey, Joe, you want to be on my TV show?
*  I was like, OK, what do I got?
*  Well, I only got like an hour.
*  He goes, we're handing out medals for the best New York boobs.
*  And so he gives me this box of medals and me and him just walk around with this box of
*  medals.
*  This is like 2001ish, something like that.
*  Wow.
*  So funny.
*  I mean, you could never do this today.
*  You got the best New York boobs.
*  Wow, look at you.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking, hey.
*  Wow.
*  This is just completely random.
*  Shit, he's just like Dave Chappelle there, too.
*  He wasn't coming up with a new guy.
*  He's very sure who he was.
*  Yeah.
*  Like he's got his arm on her boobs.
*  You go to jail for that today.
*  You go to jail for that today.
*  Yeah.
*  It was just Bobcat was directing it.
*  That's so funny.
*  Yeah, just complete random running to Bobcat in the middle of nowhere.
*  That's cool, yes.
*  And he was older than us where he was like, he knew his shit.
*  Well, he was a guy that like, you know, Bobcat had that crazy act early on where, yeah, yeah,
*  yeah, yeah.
*  He decided he didn't want to do it anymore.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  And then he would just do stand up and people were like, hey, where's Bobcat?
*  Yeah, right.
*  Fuck you.
*  Yeah, he fucking had, he stayed strong with quitting it.
*  Yeah, he had to stay strong with quitting it.
*  He did a show with me about a year ago.
*  He came out a couple of times, I think, and fucking murdered.
*  He's a funny guy.
*  Yeah.
*  He was always a very funny stand up.
*  But he was trapped in that character that he did, that screaming, crazy pull your hair
*  out character.
*  Yes.
*  You know, it's like there's guys that have characters like Emo Phillips.
*  Wow, yeah.
*  I loved him.
*  Yeah, but you can't do that when you're 80.
*  Yes, I know.
*  I know, I know.
*  It's like you're trapped.
*  But I was trying to do that.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  When I was young and I wasn't doing well, I was like, I started doing a guy who was
*  drunk on stage.
*  I started doing a guy who was very nervous.
*  I don't know.
*  I was going for that shit too.
*  Just trying to find it.
*  I didn't know what.
*  I was trying to be comfortable on stage.
*  Right.
*  That's what you had going on your live show.
*  I was like, oh shit, comfortable, fucking not terrified.
*  You sat in moments, not easy to do.
*  I was in the zone.
*  You were in the zone.
*  How about the fact that you got in the zone when there are times when you walk on on stage
*  in these pressure moments, you just go, I'm here.
*  I'm talking, but I'm not here right now.
*  Right.
*  My mouth is moving.
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  You didn't have that though.
*  I had been through a bunch of those before, so I knew never to let that happen when I
*  was out there in the live show.
*  That's also why I was scared of doing it.
*  I just really overprepared.
*  That's big.
*  I made sure that when I got out there, I just said to myself, everything that I'm talking
*  about, I want to be only thinking about that subject.
*  I'm not going to let my mind deviate or go, oh my God, this is going good.
*  Right.
*  Don't fuck up this segue.
*  Don't fuck this up.
*  You can't think like that.
*  I felt like when I'm at my best, I'm only thinking about the thing I'm talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  Then you lock the audience in.
*  I think stand up is a form of hypnosis.
*  Yes.
*  Do you think so too?
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  I get exactly what you're saying.
*  You lock them in to the way you're ... When I'm seeing a guy kill on stage, I'm locked
*  in to the way they're thinking.
*  I'm letting them think for me.
*  I'm just like, think for me.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so funny.
*  It's a form of hypnosis.
*  Absolutely.
*  I said the only way that that's going to really work is I have to just be completely dialed
*  in.
*  I wrote out all my bits.
*  I listened to recordings.
*  I watched videos.
*  I prepared for five hours the day of the show.
*  Wow.
*  Just watching video.
*  I went to the gym.
*  In the gym, I'm listening to my set.
*  Listening to your own shit, yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just like, I want to be just dialed in.
*  I get like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  100% dialed in.
*  Oh, that's a fucking great feeling when you go, I know all my shit, man.
*  Sometimes I'll do a tour.
*  Then I'll break down for two weeks because I can't be gone too long.
*  And then I go, oh shit, I got a gig again Friday.
*  And then I listen to the shit.
*  And then I start going, oh yeah, oh yeah, fuck, fuck.
*  You forget tags.
*  Oh god.
*  Yeah.
*  But then that two week break on a tour and then you go back out, man, you're psyched
*  to say that shit again.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And you come up with other shit to say.
*  Yeah.
*  But you do have to go over the material.
*  Your brain doesn't remember anymore.
*  Like your stuff just goes away.
*  What about you with having shit that steps on?
*  The hardest part of doing an hour is fucking having the 10 minutes up front not hurt the
*  fucking next time.
*  It's just so crazy.
*  I got a lot of stuff.
*  But it's been six years since my last special.
*  Like I said, I was thinking about doing a special in August of 2020.
*  Then the country shut down and then I didn't do stand up for eight months.
*  And then when I did do stand up again, I remember I had to listen to old recordings.
*  Yeah.
*  I had to record everything.
*  Yeah, that's good.
*  I have all my recordings on my phone.
*  So I'd listen to stuff and I had to write things out.
*  But I remember the first set that I did, I did the Houston improv and I hadn't done stand
*  up in forever.
*  And I remember when I was on stage, it was like, oh, this is weird.
*  I had never in my whole career, I got knee surgery and from my knee surgery, I took two
*  weeks off.
*  They're like the most I'd ever taken off ever.
*  And I think one other time I took a month off for some reason.
*  I forget why, but that was weird too.
*  But that was like when I was in the middle of a bunch of other stuff.
*  I was just working so much.
*  I didn't have any time.
*  And then I remember that was when I don't do that again, because it feels awkward to
*  get back.
*  But eight months was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just such a bizarre feeling.
*  Yeah, you forget how to do it.
*  Yeah, but it's kind of even just two weeks.
*  Take two weeks and go back on stage again.
*  You feel weird.
*  What am I doing?
*  It's all new shit to your brain again.
*  It's also the experience of doing it is weird.
*  You know how to do it, but it just feels it doesn't feel comfortable.
*  What a fucking odd feeling when you think about going on stage and just going, yeah,
*  I'm basically telling all you people, just watch me for an hour.
*  Just watch me.
*  It's worth your time.
*  I know you drove.
*  You got babysitters.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  This is here we go.
*  Yeah, you bought tickets in advance.
*  You planned your day out.
*  What a psycho of a human being to just go, let me fucking come look at this.
*  Yeah, you have to be out of your fucking mind.
*  Or just really prepared.
*  Yeah, man.
*  My special, this one, I did probably two and a half hours of shit and had to cut it.
*  You know, Josh Safdie and we all had to pick the right, the shit we thought was the right
*  shit.
*  That's, but I did have so much shit.
*  By the time I did the special, I just came off the road.
*  So I just had.
*  Where'd you record it?
*  Place in Glendale.
*  A little theater.
*  Oh, cool.
*  I'm sorry to interrupt.
*  Can I hit it?
*  Can I pee for one?
*  Yeah, we can wrap this up.
*  We've done two hours and 40 minutes.
*  We did?
*  Yeah.
*  We've been in that long?
*  Yeah.
*  It's fucking insane.
*  This is the set up.
*  Oh, that's my first, my first Netflix.
*  I like the backdrop.
*  The backdrop too.
*  It's just normal.
*  Yeah, that's cool.
*  Yeah, that's cool.
*  Did you set it up like that or is that just what it looked like back there?
*  That was it.
*  That was that theater.
*  I forgot the name of that theater.
*  It's a cool.
*  So it's left it the way it looks.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  That actually, that day was, you know, Paul Thomas Anderson, the great guy and a great
*  director.
*  He shot that shit.
*  How many people are there in the crowd?
*  Some that one there, that's that first special I did like five, six years ago.
*  That some are like big ass joints, you know, like big arena, then some are like 200, 300.
*  But the new one?
*  The new one was only like, I don't know, 200.
*  200 people?
*  250.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It was real small.
*  That's a great way to do it, too, because the people that are in the audience, there's
*  200 people like, so people at home, it's going to be like you're there instead of being in
*  an arena where you feel disconnected.
*  You can laugh at the jokes, but you don't feel like you're there.
*  That's exactly what, so Josh Safdie, he directed it.
*  He wanted it to feel like you're getting to hang out with me.
*  And it's kind of like just shit goes on throughout the show that's that wasn't supposed to happen.
*  And that's that.
*  It shows me before a show, during the show, and after the show.
*  And man, we had fun.
*  It is a great fucking vibe, that place.
*  That was not a comedy club.
*  It was just a little theater that they do.
*  These people bought a theater.
*  They put on little plays there and shit, and then Josh liked it, and they made it kind
*  of feel like a stand up.
*  That's awesome.
*  And when is it out?
*  What day?
*  The 27th.
*  August 27th.
*  Okay, it's a couple weeks from now.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  All right, man.
*  Congratulations on yours.
*  Congratulations on everything, buddy.
*  Thanks.
*  Congratulations to you too.
*  My piss ended the whole thing.
*  I appreciate it.
*  No, it's all good.
*  All right, right on, man.
*  It's amazing you hung in this long.
*  Fuck.
*  A lot of people, an hour and a half in, they started clamping up.
*  That's good, man.
*  I just mentally said I got to get past that pissing, man.
*  Well, thank you, brother.
*  I appreciate you.
*  Thanks for being here too.
*  Good to see you, Joe.
*  Congrats.
*  Thank you.
*  Keep up all the good work.
*  Say hi to your family, too.
*  Thank you.
*  All right.
*  Bye, everybody.
