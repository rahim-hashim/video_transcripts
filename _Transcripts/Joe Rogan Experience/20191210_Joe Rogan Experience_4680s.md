# Joe Rogan Experience #1397 - S.C. Gwynne
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 10, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq8Ss9yg6bo)
*  Three, two, okay. So, very nice to meet you. And very, your book is fantastic. I really,
*  really loved it. And it's kind of hilarious how this conversation came about. You said
*  you got a call from your publicist because your audio book spiked.
*  It spiked like crazy. It was like, what Cosmic Dust and the Outer Bands of Jupiter just did
*  that, because we didn't figure out what it was. It just spiked like crazy, went nuts.
*  I think it went to number one briefly. So, what did that? Anyway.
*  And it was from an Instagram post.
*  It was.
*  And you were, see, my friend Steve Rinella wrote a book called American Buffalo. And I had put on
*  Instagram how great the book was, and he did the audio version of it. And a friend of mine on
*  Instagram, he goes by the name of the Jackalope. He's a fellow Hunter S. Thompson enthusiast. He
*  said, you got to read this book. And so, he tells me to read your book, Empire of the Summer Moon.
*  And it was amazing. I mean, he was absolutely right. And it was so good. And I made an Instagram
*  post about that. There it is. Oh, we got a copy of it. Look at that, ladies and gentlemen.
*  It's a fantastic book. There's so much good stuff in there. And I just, it was so sad.
*  And so gripping and so riveting. And we all know that a lot of horrific things happened in the time
*  where the settlers started making their way across the plains and headed west. But God, you just did
*  such a fantastic job of sort of bringing it to life. It's all those things. It's brutal. It's sad.
*  It's incredibly dramatic. I mean, I just think people forget about what the frontier was.
*  It's kind of a nice idea that you get on TV or something, but it was a savage place.
*  Anyway, I was trying to convey it with the minimum possible of people being stank out
*  on Ant Hills with their eyelids cut off and things like that.
*  Pete Slauson There's a lot of that though, right?
*  Pete Slauson There's a lot of that.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I mean, the horrors of it all is like,
*  you know, and I'd never seen, I knew that that kind of stuff had taken place, but I really never
*  read it so graphically depicted before this book. What motivated you to write about all this?
*  Pete Slauson So, this is a book about me. I'm a Connecticut
*  Yankee, Massachusetts Connecticut guy. I moved to Texas 25 years ago and I've been there ever
*  since. And I didn't know anything about Texas history. Nothing. Beyond whatever you might know
*  about the Alamo or something or Sam Houston or somebody like that. And I got there and I just
*  started to, you know, I started to hear about one, the Great Plains and what they were, which was
*  an alien concept to me. I wasn't sure what the plains were or why they were different than some
*  other part of the country, the High Plains. And I came into this idea, I came upon this idea that
*  the last frontier was there, that this is where it all went down. This is where like the end of
*  freedom and limitlessness, it didn't happen. The frontier didn't push forward until it got to
*  California and then hit the ocean. California settled, the east settled, and then there was
*  this one last place that did not. And it went on for, and there were reasons for that, one of which
*  was the most hostile Indian tribes in the country. Another was that it was, there was no water,
*  water, you know, there was basically only land, no water or timber. But, so I got into this and then,
*  you know, lo and behold, there's this, I find out because I live in Texas that there's this
*  principle that lives on this, that lived on this land, the Comanches, that determined everything
*  that happened in the American West around them. And that's not an exaggeration. They were, because
*  until, you know, the West wasn't won until they lost it. And that was for sure. And so there were
*  two things. One, this arc of the rise and fall of the most powerful tribe, most influential tribe in
*  American history, the Comanches, which was very cool from the Spanish and the horse and all sorts
*  of big stuff that goes on. And then in the middle of that story was this little story of this little
*  nine-year-old girl with, you know, blonde hair and cornflower blue eyes who gets taken in a Comanche
*  raid in 1836, who ends up becoming the, you know, mother of the last and greatest chief of the
*  Comanches. And in fact, her kidnapping and his surrender at the very end of the Comanches,
*  you know, sort of bookend a 40-year war. We never fought a 40-year war against anybody except them.
*  So I ran into this story and I'm just a kid from Connecticut and it just seemed like the most obvious
*  book in the world. It was just the coolest history.
*  Pete It's a crazy story and I never heard of Cynthia Ann Parker before. Now, she's,
*  we have her on your wall. We have a giant metal picture of her on the wall. Because it was so
*  powerful, your depiction of it too, I wanted to, I wanted to find out what she looks like.
*  And what is his name again?
*  Quana.
*  Pete So, Quana.
*  Pete Quana was his, the name was on the cover of the book.
*  Right. Because his mother was Cynthia Ann Parker, which was not, that didn't come out and no one
*  found out that until he was much older. So, he was born Quana as a Comanche. Later in the reservation
*  period when people found out who he was, he identified as part of the Parker family also.
*  Pete Oh, wow.
*  Pete Yeah. So, as a famous Comanche Warchief and he was one of the most famous and feared,
*  he was Quana.
*  That's such a crazy story that they killed so many people but occasionally,
*  they would keep people and bring them into the tribe.
*  Pete Right. So, there were rules of the frontier at the time, and we're talking about how savage
*  it was, and the rules of the, at least of the Plains Indians, of which the Comanches were one,
*  that if you were captured as an adult male, you were killed,
*  tortured to death, either quickly or slowly depending on how much time they had.
*  If you were a baby, you were killed. They couldn't deal with a baby. Baby was, they were nomads and
*  they were on their horse and they were probably escaping from whatever raid they had just done.
*  They couldn't deal with babies. A teenage girl or a young woman would possibly be killed but likely
*  turned into sort of a slave. The ones who had a chance of being adopted into the tribe were the,
*  8, 9, 10, 11, 12 year olds because Comanches had trouble keeping their numbers up and so,
*  they instinctively kind of, they would take these captives and not just from
*  white people, the Apaches and the Utes and the Navajos and whoever they might take them from.
*  And so, what was interesting about the frontier though is that those rules applied,
*  so long, forget about white people arriving in the early 18th century for the moment.
*  Those rules had applied to Indian tribes since forever. You know, that was the assumption of a
*  raid. They all had, it was almost like the golden rule in reverse or the golden rule,
*  do unto others. They all expected that kind of treatment. None of them were shocked when
*  a baby was killed or a pregnant woman was killed. It took the kind of, you know, the Anglo-European
*  civilization of, you know, Newton and Leibniz and the biblical tradition to arrive on the Texas
*  frontier in 1830 and be shocked at what they saw. Very interesting, very savage, very brutal.
*  It was a culture of raiding, essentially.
*  This is the Comanche culture in particular or Native Americans in general?
*  Well, Native Americans in general, Plains Indians in general. And, you know, so Plains Indians,
*  we could kind of start, you know, you would know the names of a lot of them, Arapaho and Cheyenne
*  and Sioux, and these were people who operated out in the great wide open. They were all masters of
*  the horse. What made the Comanche special was that they became the preeminent horse tribe.
*  People forget that there weren't any horses in this, in the continent until the Spanish
*  brought them in the 16th century. And so the tribes that got the horse and mastered the horse
*  basically altered the entire balance of power in the Plains. And the tribe that got the horse
*  better than anybody else in terms of breaking and breeding and saddling and riding and stealing and
*  hunting on the back of and fighting with were the Comanches and nobody was their peer. And so this
*  was not just a Plains tribe, it was the preeminent power on the Southern Plains.
*  Did you know that horses originally evolved here in North America?
*  No.
*  And then they went extinct here, but then they reintroduced them.
*  Really?
*  The Europeans did, yeah. There's a guy named Dan Flores. He's got a bunch of great books and one
*  of them is called Coyote America. He's got another one. What is his other book about the various
*  large land animals that went extinct here in North America, but that the wolf and a lot of the other
*  ones, what is it?
*  Conseringhetti.
*  That's it.
*  The natural west also.
*  Yeah. He's fantastic. And essentially they all went extinct. All the horses went extinct here.
*  They were reintroduced by Europeans, but they had originally evolved here in North America.
*  And I didn't know.
*  Yeah. So there's no, but there's no evidence that any of the native people here really used them
*  until Europeans came, whether it was Cortez or whoever, Cortez with the Aztecs or whoever
*  else came across.
*  Horses, a horse is so much a part of the story. So they come over with the Spanish. The Spanish
*  are acutely aware of what is going to happen if the horse technology gets out and they take
*  great pains to not let it get out. They don't want to teach the Indians in Mexico or the
*  Indians in North America how to use them, but inevitably the technology does get out.
*  And then there's a few moments. There's a great moment in time in 1680 in Santa Fe,
*  when there's a great Pueblo revolt and they kick the Spanish out and like tens of thousands of
*  horses get out. It's the great horse dispersal. And these are the horses that come into the hands
*  of these plains tribes.
*  So in the 1600s, that their power and their dominance started to assert itself?
*  Begins.
*  So how did the Comanches figure out how to have all these horses and how valuable that was,
*  or some of the other tribes just hadn't kind of caught on?
*  No one knows, and it's interesting, no one knows that because it was only seen in flashes by the
*  Spanish through their kind of northern outposts. No one exactly knows what it was in the heart
*  and soul of a Comanche that could do that better than anybody else. And in fact, Comanches,
*  by all descriptions of the time, were not, pre-horse anyway, graceful people. They were
*  kind of short and kind of bow-legged and they weren't especially graceful.
*  They didn't look like perhaps you would think of the northern Sioux Indians on the nickel,
*  I mean that kind of tall and with the bone structure. That wasn't the Comanches.
*  And then they got on a horse and then everything changed. And even though the Apaches were the
*  first ones to actually get that technology from the Spanish, and they raised havoc with it, but
*  the tribe that got it the best and the most were the Comanches. They were the tribe that actually
*  ended up supplying horses to a lot of the northern plains tribes that we just talked about.
*  And what they did was once they had this incredible mastery of the horse and this ability to hunt like
*  they never had and fight like they never had, they did what you would, I guess, expect the great new
*  power in the plains. The plains are a big place by the way. The great new power in the plains is
*  going to challenge for the greatest food source out in mid-America and that was the Buffalo herds.
*  And they were in the southern plains. So the Comanches over a period of 150 years of sustained
*  combat moved south from the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming essentially into this 250,000 square mile
*  empire. Think of kind of headquartered in the Texas Panhandle, which is where the Buffalo were.
*  And this tribe, they were known for being Buffalo hunters and they were also known,
*  they weren't really like making artwork or doing a lot of the things that we sort of associate with
*  other Native American tribes. They were mostly just hunting and raiding.
*  Right. And the things that we all would associate with Native Americans, you know, this
*  wonderful abilities in dance and music, complex religion and complex religious social structures
*  to go along with it and all these different things, music and dance and all these things.
*  The Comanches, by the time that the kind of Anglo-Europeans run into them, they are a
*  stripped down culture that looks more like Sparta. And one of the reasons they are is because they've
*  been fighting this long war primarily against the Apaches, but against other tribes over decades.
*  And during that time, as they became ascendant militarily, they became less interested in those
*  things. They became interested in war conveyed status, right? War conveyed numbers of ponies
*  and status and the thing. And so, yes, they were a stripped down war culture, I guess,
*  to whatever extent we know or something about Sparta would remind you of Sparta.
*  That's what's so interesting about it is it's such a unique tribe, just a very unique branch
*  of Native Americans that was specifically like this. They made war and they conquered
*  and when you think about what they got themselves finally, it's about, I said 250,000 square miles,
*  this probably doesn't mean anything, but think of West Texas, Western Oklahoma, Western Kansas,
*  Eastern Colorado and Eastern New Mexico, gigantic chunks of that. That was theirs.
*  And when you think also of the numbers of them that were there when say the Anglo-Europeans
*  and the Americans came through in the 1830s, there was probably 25 or 30,000 of them out there,
*  of which 5 or 6,000 warriors. Now, I don't know what 5 or 6,000 suggests to you, but it suggests to
*  me like the third baseline at Yankee Stadium or something, it's not very many people,
*  occupying this gigantic area that became, as I was saying earlier, determinant of everything
*  that happened around it. Well, your depictions of how the raid happened where St. Anne Parker
*  got kidnapped and how all these other various raids happened was so terrifying because these
*  people, the initial ones really kind of had no idea what they were in for.
*  Pete Slauson These are the Parkers.
*  Pete Larkin Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yes. So, as I say, my book's about the rise and fall of the Comanches as a tribe,
*  which we've been talking about. But then there's this little family, the Parkers.
*  And the Parkers did what so many other Texans did and this was the crazy Americans who moved
*  across their frontiers in ways that just were, they were beyond brave and too foolhardy. I mean,
*  people, if you look at, say, what happened in Canada or what the Spanish did, there was always
*  the, you know, the soldiers would ride in first and set up the presidio and then the priests would
*  come in and, you know, the mission would be set up and then the protections would be in place and
*  the institutions and then the people would come. In Texas, it was just these rednecks from Tennessee
*  and Alabama coming through with no protection of any kind. You know, no, there were no institutions.
*  They were out beyond any form of security or protection or institutions. And so, this is what
*  the Parkers were in the 1830s. They were about 90 miles south of Dallas and you had Spanish in New
*  Mexico, but nothing but Comanches and Apaches between where these people were and that. So,
*  you know, 800 miles of nothing. And so, what they had done is they had taken these head rights
*  or grants from Mexico, which owned Texas at that point. They'd been given about, you know,
*  20,000 acres worth, which is a kingdom from their point of view. And the Mexicans were giving them
*  this so that they could provide a buffer against the Comanches, basically providing fresh meat for
*  the Comanches. And so, they built this little fort out there, out right at the end. And it was so
*  cool. It was not only out in the middle of nowhere, the absolute edge of the frontier,
*  of the Indian frontier, where it was in great danger. It was also right at a part where the
*  rainfall drops, you know, below 30 inches, where we go from around the 98th meridian, where we go
*  from what we think of as the east to the west, where there's no trees, right? It happens right
*  there too. It also happens right that this raid in 1830 that started this out where the little blonde
*  girl was taken. This also happens at a time when this gigantic Comanche empire with 20 vassal states
*  and, you know, diplomatic relations, touches this westward booming American empire. All these guys
*  in Washington wearing suits and running around, that empire is, and they're touching right at this
*  point. And neither has any idea what the other one is. The Comanches have no idea that these
*  Parker family is sitting there attached in some way to cities in the east and the burgeoning
*  industrial revolution. They would not know what that was. By the same token, the Americans coming
*  west had absolutely no clue that they just hit. They just did what they shouldn't have done,
*  which was to push into Comanche territory. It's so crazy that they set them up like that.
*  Oh, it's so dark. I mean, but it's just such a wild time too. I mean, but also so recent. I mean,
*  I'm 52, so we're talking about three of my lifetimes. Three of my lifetimes ago, it was on like
*  Donkey Kong down there. Just crazy. I mean, it's hard to believe that that recently, some unbelievably
*  horrific, barbaric hand-to-hand combat, killing people and slaughtering entire villages and the
*  stuff that went back and forth between the Native Americans and between the white settlers. I mean,
*  it was just, it's unbelievable. It's one of the most, what you just said is one of the most striking
*  things about this to me and was when I, the Connecticut kid came to Texas, was that
*  where I grew up, Indians had been, well, when I say subdued, usually killed off by white man's
*  diseases, but if not by bullets or treaties or something, I mean, a couple of hundred years
*  before my forebears ever got off the boat. There wasn't a frontier in memory anyway. I mean, there
*  were Indian tribes around and I played baseball with some of them in the summers and so forth.
*  I knew of them, but this was a really distant memory. Okay, get to Texas. 1875 is when the
*  last of the Comanches came in and there was a whole bunch of Jocelyn on and off the res
*  after that into the 20th century. Yeah, 140 plus years ago. So we're talking within a really close
*  generational memory and that's what's really stunning. And if you talk to Tana, where are
*  you from originally, Joe? Boston. So Boston, okay, you and I, okay, Boston. I was born in Jersey,
*  but did most of my grow up in Boston. Most of my family came from Boston. And so the difference
*  between that and what, if you go to Texas, there's an area west of Fort Worth, kind of Weatherford,
*  Palo Pinto County, Parker County now where you can talk to people and they're still talking about
*  Comanches. Really? It's their great grandfather was killed by them. Wow. So that's Texas and that's
*  why it's so, I found it so striking. So really striking. It's also striking because you realize
*  over the course of the book and I mean, just, and then more books that I've gotten into subsequently
*  that this was something that was going on before the white settlers even got there, that this way
*  of life and the raiding and the killing and that's not what we associate Native Americans with. We
*  associate us with taking the Native Americans' land and then them fighting back and that's when
*  things get ugly. But it turns out this was just a wild way of life that they had had for who knows
*  how many years. One of the things that surprised people when I wrote this book and I didn't know
*  that I was going to be surprising people because I was just reporting what I found was that very
*  thing. That this was, I think people are often used to the bury my heart and it wounded any narrative
*  of Native Americans which is as victims. And there's no question that they were victims of
*  a westward rolling empire and 378 broken treaties and we can just go on and we know what that
*  narrative is like. But the narrative that I told was a narrative of power, dominance of power,
*  which came with brutality too and I think it surprised, it was a fact. It was a fact that if
*  you go back in time, these Native American tribes, that eventually got crushed as the Comanches did
*  and put on a reservation somewhere and had their livelihood taken away from them.
*  But you know, it really, anyway, it's a huge deal and a narrative that I think to me that doesn't
*  take into account the enormous power and dominance and behavior of Comanches is just missing,
*  you know, half the narrative.
*  Well, it's so fascinating because it's essentially they were living like stone age people and they
*  were doing it very recently. They were doing it like in terms of the way Europe is, you could go
*  and see buildings in Italy that were built long before any of this stuff happened, long before the
*  settlers started encountering them and they were living like this and this sort of, I mean, it's
*  very romantic. The way they lived, just chasing the buffalo and killing them and then eating only
*  buffalo meat and then doing very little farming, picking some berries and nuts and that's about it.
*  I mean, it was just eating meat and raiding and killing.
*  They were hunter gatherers. They were nomadic hunter gatherers, which is what they were and
*  what the horse allowed them to do was to, which is what they had been before. The horse allowed
*  them to do that only just really, really, really well. In other words, they were they weren't in a
*  position of becoming agricultural Indians. The horse gave them this ability to, and as you said,
*  they got everything from the buffalo clothing and lodging and tools and saddles and bridles and food.
*  I mean, everything came from the buffalo. So the horse just enabled them to do this on an
*  incredibly sophisticated level. It's the most sad part of the story is the extirpating of the
*  buffalo. I mean, that's not the most sad, but one of the that their way of life. It's almost like,
*  you know what happened, but I'm rooting for them in some weird way. I mean, I know that they're
*  not going to win, but there's something about the way they lived. It seems so exciting. And the other
*  thing is the way you described Cynthia Ann Parker post being, air quote, rescued, like how badly she
*  wanted to go back to the Comanche and how she missed the way they looked at the world,
*  that the world was in many ways, there was so much magic involved in the way the Comanche
*  viewed the sky and the ground and that there was gods that were looking out for them and that they
*  could literally have magic going into battle. Like all this, the romance of this nomadic lifestyle
*  was that's what she wanted. And like when you talked about that one guy that spoke Comanche
*  and that she meets him and she's like, please take me, take me with you. Yeah, it's crazy.
*  Pete Slauson It was, so she was taken about the age of, I guess it was nine and then she was
*  with the Comanches for 24 years. She completely assimilated. She married a war chief. She had
*  three children. She, they tried, you know, at two different times, they knew where she was. Indian
*  agents figured out where she was and they made a push to get her back because the idea generally
*  was to get captives back. She wouldn't go. And then suddenly in a raid, purely by accident,
*  she's captured in 1860 and is dragged back. Pete Slauson And she has to show that she's white so
*  that they don't kill her, right? Pete Slauson Right. She has to show that she's a woman and
*  white so that they don't kill her. She barely escapes from that. But she ends up being, you
*  know, forcibly re-assimilated. So, here's someone who completely assimilated once
*  with great success. And then in her 30s now, she's taken back into this white culture. And in fact,
*  they put her up in a, they were so astounded to see her because she was, Indians weren't the
*  cleanest people in the world. I mean, her job was to kind of, you know, tan buffalo hides. So, she,
*  her kind of greasy looking and, you know, didn't look like a white farm, you know, white
*  god-fearing farm woman from Dallas. But they put her up on a, you know, on a pedestal with her
*  daughter and they kind of looked at her and stared at her as this kind of, this strange object,
*  the white squaw who wouldn't return, this kind of object of curiosity. And then she gets kind of
*  shuffled ever deeper into the East Texas piney woods and ever farther away from her people.
*  It was interesting. She was, having assimilated once brilliantly, she was asked in effect to do
*  it again and she couldn't and she never did. But going back for just one moment to something you
*  said was this idea of this kind of freedom and magic. There was, in Comanche, and it was,
*  it was all there. It was this world that was suffused with magic everywhere you looked. There
*  was magic in everything. But one of the things it also was, and this was relayed by actually male
*  captives of the Comanches. Now, the Comanches had a very flat hierarchical organization or a very
*  flat hierarchy. There was like, it may be a war chief and a civil chief, but there was really no,
*  there were no priest clans and hierarchies. There was, it was just flat. And if you were a
*  T'Kwana Parker young warrior and you wanted to get together a raid on the Utes, you could just do it.
*  It was just, you could do what you wanted to do. And so you look at these, this one particular
*  captive was talking about this and he was talking about being 15 years old. This was before the
*  Comanche men had to fight and really hunt. They could do some hunting, but they weren't yet
*  in the full responsibility of men. There they are sitting there. They've got no responsibilities
*  except to go hunt and have fun and go swimming and learn how to become the greatest riders in
*  the world. They've got no institution around them of any kind. They've got, and you start to think
*  of why do people go west, you know, away from institutions, away from things that were going
*  to make them less free. And so I looked at, and I describe it this way, a 15 year old Comanche boy
*  may have been like the freest thing that ever existed in America. And I can feel the pull.
*  Yeah, I think we all can. I mean, when we were kids growing up, you didn't,
*  we played cowboys and Indians. And a lot of people wanted to be Indians. You wanted to wear those
*  Native American jackets with the frill. And there was so much of that that was attractive to us. And
*  that was a big part of it was that they were free. You know, dances with wolves, obviously,
*  you know, when Kevin Costner gets assimilated into that tribe, there's something exciting about it.
*  Like, it's more noble, it's sought to be like a more powerful alternative to this Western grind.
*  And, and, and again, you're just, you're out there and, and, and you are beyond the reach of any of
*  the normal institutions that we think about school and work and job and government and religion and
*  church and all the things that bind people in and most people are happy to be bound by them, but,
*  but many people aren't. And I thought that this, there was an idea of the West,
*  of kind of limitless freedom. This West, the predates barbed wire and private property.
*  And that just seemed, I don't know, I still find it just one of the most appealing
*  things to think about. And just the fact that it's so recent. That's what's really crazy.
*  Really recent. We're talking about the urban sprawl and barbed wire and things along those
*  lines. I mean, and it's particularly in Texas where everything's almost private property.
*  I mean, just giant ranches everywhere. And this was all run by the Comanche.
*  98% of Texas is unlike if you go one, one state to the West and you're at the, you're in the big land,
*  public land, government land states, Texas is 98% private now.
*  That's a weird thing, isn't it?
*  It is.
*  It's very strange.
*  How did that happen?
*  Well, it happened because that's the way it settled. And the public land states just,
*  there was, for one thing, there was a lot more of apparently a sort of useless land in the Western
*  States. But anyway, it happened. And in Texas, you're lucky to get yourself a state park here
*  and there.
*  When you were doing research for this, did you meet with any current Comanches?
*  I met with some of them and I know some of them, some of them are on my website.
*  But as far as interviewing them for things that happened two or 300 years ago, that's not really
*  that's sort of a non-starter as a historian. Although, although the book itself is based on
*  lots and lots of interviews with Comanches, but of the era people who this is, this was the great,
*  there was some great projects done in the 20s and 30s with Comanches who talked about,
*  you know, who had memories of the 19th century. And so a lot of what we know with this in my book
*  that we know about the Comanches and who they are come from all of these interviews.
*  And there's a lot in my book that comes from Comanches, but again, of the era. So, you know,
*  I just figured that interviewing people today about things that happened a long time ago was
*  probably not that efficient.
*  No, for sure not that efficient. But still, to me, it would be kind of fascinating to see
*  where they are now. I mean, the Native American reservations in this country have traditionally
*  been pretty horrific and it's very depressing and sad. And for the people that live there, just
*  so little hope and so little opportunity. And it's, as you were talking about before,
*  the broken treaties and just to see them having gone from being this incredible warlike tribe to
*  being resigned to these very small patches of land that are usually not very fruitful and not very
*  resource filled.
*  And that happened to a lot of tribes. I mean, if you look at the Comanches,
*  the Comanches are a pretty small tribe. They're located in their center, although there's no
*  reservations in them. There's no, excuse me.
*  You all right?
*  Yeah, they don't have a tail end of the flu. They don't have a reservation there, but they
*  I'd say the last number I heard was 14,000 or something like that. One of the big, I guess,
*  ironically, in some ways, determinant factors in how wealthy a tribe is now is proximity to
*  a major urban area. For example, Chickasaws and Choctaws are in range of DFW. So their casinos
*  there make a lot of money. The Seminoles in Florida, there's some tribes in California who
*  are making a lot of money. If you go up to say, some of the Sioux reservations, well up
*  north on the plains, they're not near, they just, the lands, their traditional lands
*  just don't happen to be close to urban centers. Yeah, urban centers. And so there's a little bit
*  of that going on there, but yeah, that's, this is just where we, the US government, put the Indians.
*  And in terms of plains Indians and Comanches and Arapahos and Cheyennes and Sioux and everybody
*  else, they never wanted to be farmers. Farming was exactly what they never wanted to do.
*  And even if you gave them 160 acres, they would sublet it. They would rent it out to usually a
*  white farmer who would farm it and they would take a sharecropping percentage or something. But
*  yeah, so they didn't want anything to do with that. And above all, they didn't want to be
*  forced into a type of life that they had never done before and considered it just kind of unseemly.
*  So do Comanches have a reservation today? No. No reservation at all?
*  Well, the problem is the way, this is going to get into a lot of detail, but I mean, Oklahoma,
*  they basically, in favor of, in place of reservations, they gave out individual
*  portionments of land. And had them assimilated. Yeah, so where I, for example, where I came from
*  the East Coast, there are reservations. If you go to say, Colorado, you'll go to, you see the
*  Ute reservation or some of the Sioux reservations. There's reservations all over the place, not in
*  Oklahoma. Wow. So they're in danger of having their culture probably get erased. They're pretty,
*  I mean, I think they would tell you, I mean, I don't want to speak for Comanches or anybody else,
*  but that they're pretty strongly organized where they are. They have a nation. They do have a
*  nation. It's just, they don't have a body of a reservation, but they do have a nation. But if
*  they have a nation, they don't have the same sort of laws that ones have a reservation. No, they
*  actually do. So if you go, for example, I spent some time with the Chickasaws a few years ago.
*  It's incredible. Now they don't have a quote reservation either, but they have little pieces
*  of land that is theirs. But they also have a completely parallel police system, completely
*  parallel legislature. They have parallel healthcare systems. And you can drive through
*  these parts of Oklahoma where I don't say Choctaws or Cherokees or whoever they may be are. And
*  there are these whole parallel worlds that are existing right in front of you and you don't see
*  them. Wow. Yes. So no, actually I think they're, in a lot of ways, a lot of the tribes in Oklahoma
*  are doing well. But you literally can drive through it and you wouldn't be able to tell.
*  It's just such a stunning amount of change that happened to this continent over a short,
*  relatively short period of time. Yeah. I mean, really astounding. And if you look at what,
*  from the moment that the last Comanche is surrendered with Quanah and the last of the
*  starving, all the Buffalo have been killed now. And so they're coming in and it's 1875.
*  That very year, their old kind of main, I guess, camping ground would be Palo Duro Canyon, one of
*  the biggest canyons in the American West up in the Texas Panhandle. And that's kind of where
*  their sanctuary was or one of their big sanctuaries were. Within that very year,
*  white men already owned Palo Duro Canyon. There was already a ranch on it. It was already private
*  property. Within a few years, there's barbed wire going all the way up. I mean, this is happening.
*  I mean, so in other words, you have the transfer of ownership. Suddenly white people owned the
*  land that the Indians used to be theirs, right? The second thing that happens is now we have the
*  cattle drives just before barbed wire. And then there's only a few years of cattle drives. And
*  then the barbed wire goes up and this happens with just breathtaking speed. And I mean,
*  from really the moment that they started killing the Buffalo off in the, what, 1870 or something,
*  1871 to, I mean, full barbed wire, it's just, it's less than a couple of decades.
*  Pete Slauson It's such a great story.
*  Pete Huston And the fact that this young girl, Cynthia Anne Parker, gets kidnapped and gives
*  birth to this man who eventually becomes the last great Comanche chief and literally watches the
*  entire empire change and shift into this what we now call Western world.
*  Pete Slauson Yep. He rides in Teddy Roosevelt's inaugural parade.
*  Pete Huston Well, that was also what's crazy about the book,
*  like, that he meets Teddy and he has a speech with him on stage.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Huston And this is all, I mean, he had killed a lot of white people too, right? A lot of settlers.
*  Pete Slauson He didn't talk about it, but yes, he had. Because that's what Comanches did.
*  Pete Huston Yeah, so wise of him also to not talk about it.
*  Pete Huston Right. And not only Comanches, he fought Indians, he fought anybody who was out there,
*  but yes, he didn't spend a lot of time bragging about that.
*  Pete Huston Yeah, I mean, I guess it's just the way they felt about war. What is this, Jamie?
*  Jamie Baxter The parade.
*  Pete Huston Oh, here's the parade. There's an image of it.
*  Jamie Baxter I don't know which one he is, but there's six of them in the parade.
*  Pete Huston Wow.
*  Pete Huston And what year is this?
*  Jamie Baxter 1908.
*  Pete Huston So, what an insane relationship that must have been for those people to be
*  experiencing, first of all, these enormous cities and going through Washington, DC on horseback and
*  knowing what you had come from and what a catastrophic, titanic change had taken place
*  inside of your lifetime and now you're experiencing something that you didn't even think was possible
*  and it's the new law of the land. Is that quanta there?
*  Pete Huston It does look like quanta, doesn't it, in the middle? But I mean, and he was,
*  you know, he was not just ceremonial Indian. I mean, he was a brilliant man and he, one of the
*  things he did is he went to New York. I mean, went to Washington and he testified and there were all
*  these hearings trying to figure out how much land Indians were going to get and quanta, of course,
*  testified this and actually is quite brilliant. I put his testimony in my book. He's just flat,
*  brilliant. He sort of runs circles around the senator who's questioning him. So, he played an
*  active role too, but there he is, as you say, sitting in a committee room in Congress. I mean,
*  this guy who was this great free warrior on the plains.
*  Pete Huston Now, how long did it take you to research this?
*  Pete Huston You know, I did this partly while I was at a
*  day gig, so I'm not really sure, probably three or four years, something like that.
*  There isn't as much as you would think because, and the reason is, I mean, there's a fair amount
*  and it's all in Texas, which is good. But there is one curious thing about writing about Native
*  Americans is that they don't, they didn't write anything down. So, if you're writing about, say,
*  Winston Churchill, I mean, you can track him from like his bath in the morning to his seventh note
*  to ask with, to his notes to his wife, to all of his proceedings in Parliament and everything he
*  ever did. It's like moment by moment, you take someone like Quanah out on the plains and you've
*  got pretty much nothing. And so, what you have, what you do have are flashes that are seen by,
*  say, the Spanish originally or the French or Mexicans or Texans and Americans as they come
*  through. You're seeing them in flashes as they're presented to you because there are no
*  parish records, there's no legal records, there's no interviews, there's no things like that.
*  That's so stunning. It's so stunning. But that's one of the weirdest things about
*  where they are today in 2019, this idea that they don't have really a reservation or specific
*  giant chunk of land that's theirs, that they can sort of preserve at least some of this history.
*  Yeah, no, it's, it was a peculiarity of Oklahoma that it went that way because there are other
*  states, as we talked about earlier, who have, who do have large reservations to this day. But
*  yeah, so it's, so and when you get, if you're writing about them, when you get to
*  sort of the post-reservation period, so let's say into the 1880s, 1890s, the world does change in
*  terms of, you know, things are being written down. Quanah, you know, Quanah becomes a big part of his
*  society. He's setting up cattle leasing deals, he's founding a school board. I mean, he does all these
*  things that, you know, that you wouldn't necessarily think a glorious chief of the
*  Comanches would do. But he does those things. And those are very trackable. I mean, you know
*  exactly what he's doing, and you can research them in conventional ways.
*  I was fascinated by the peyote rituals too. Now, was that a natural, normal part of Comanche life,
*  or is this something that he adopted from other tribes?
*  He adapted it from something that had gone on on the border, on the Mexican border, but
*  he became the founder of the Native American Church, which had a peyote ritual in which he
*  and it became famous for. And so there was this great, a place I would really like to go back to
*  in American history would be to Quanah's house. Quanah got his cattlemen buddies to build him.
*  First of all, he wanted the U.S. government to build him a house because Quanah was a puzzler,
*  and he said, could I please have a house? They said, no, you can't have a house. So he went to his
*  cattlemen buddies and they built in this house, magnificent house, it was like 4,500 square feet,
*  double porch with these giant white stars on the roof. It became known as-
*  Is that his house right there?
*  That star house. It's fallen down, but now, but yes, in its heyday, it looked really-
*  So that still exists to this day?
*  It does. And it's about to fall down and they've-
*  Who owns it?
*  Well, this guy who lives in Cash or Lawton, Oklahoma, and who doesn't,
*  who has been unwilling to accept help or money from everybody from the Comanche nation to-
*  That's it right there. It always had the stars on the roof like that?
*  Yeah, yeah, it did because he saw that U.S. generals had these stars on their colors and
*  he wanted more than they had. But that sits there in Cash, Oklahoma. Now, I've been in it,
*  but it's gotten so beat up now that they don't let you go in it anymore, but it sits there.
*  Oh.
*  So, yeah, as long as we have that there. In 1895, if you went there, in the, let's say,
*  early 1890s, it would have been one of the most amazing scenes. We had people like Geronimo
*  coming to dinner. Roosevelt came to dinner. Nelson Miles, the great general, came to dinner.
*  He had a, I think it was a Swiss-Mexican cook. He had six wives. He had 19, or 21 children,
*  19 who grew to adulthood. The house was full of kids. It would have been surrounded by lodges.
*  The reason it would have been that is because people, his own tribe had come in for help,
*  money or pay for a funeral or going back to the peyote ritual, which is a healing ritual.
*  So you would have seen one of the great scenes in the American West. When he died in 1911,
*  people found out that he had given most of his money away to all these people who had come in
*  asking for his help. He had in fact helped them and given most of his cattle ranching money away
*  that he had made. Now this house is owned by one individual? Yes. And so, but it's a historical
*  landmark and no one's preserving it. They're not doing anything to it. You know, I don't know all
*  the details of it, but it's owned by Wayne Gibson and his sister, as far as I know still, and they've
*  owned it for a while. They don't want any help. It was that house was put into an amusement park
*  years ago to preserve it. That was owned by Wayne's uncle, as far as I know. And so it was taken
*  apart. It was, was it taken apart? I don't know. They did move it though. They moved it. So this
*  is not the original location where it's at right now? No, the original location was out on what
*  turned out to be later to be a Fort Sill gunnery artillery range. And so they, they moved it. And
*  so Quanah's, a daughter, I guess it was, moved it down into Cash. And then it was moved one more
*  time into this amusement park, literally. That when I went into this amusement park, it was like
*  something out of a, I don't know, a Spielberg movie. I mean, you go, I was told the house was back
*  there and I couldn't really believe it. But so we go in and you're going by these defunct old
*  roller coasters that are all overgrown with vines, like Sleeping Beauty's Castle, you know, and,
*  and there's cows everywhere and, and, and rides and carousels all, all overgrown. And then you
*  go through a series of houses that were also moved there, like Frank James's house or something,
*  and keep going, keep going in the back there. That thing was the house was sitting there.
*  Now it is his, he owns it. He's been approached, as I said, by all sorts of different people,
*  consortiums of people with money who want to buy it or, or just save it, you know, from literally
*  the Comanche Nation, I know, has wanted to and Texas Tech has and some Dallas people and any
*  number of people. And so to my knowledge, thus far, he refuses to sell or, or to take their help.
*  Pete Slauson Damn, is that him right there?
*  Wayne Gibson I think that is.
*  Pete Slauson That's him. Wayne.
*  Wayne Gibson. Yeah. Yeah. That's him.
*  Pete Slauson Come on, Wayne.
*  Wayne Gibson Hey, so he's a perfectly nice guy. He, he, it's, it's a, he feels the house is very
*  special in his family and it is indeed very special. But he won't. The last time, the last
*  tour I got with him, as you're going up the main stairwell, there was a four foot by six inch hole
*  in the main, in the roof above the main stairwell. I mean, you can't really have a four foot by six
*  inch hole. And the rain would just come through and but so.
*  Pete Slauson What can you do to preserve a house like this while still leaving it
*  the way it is? So, it's, you know what I'm saying? Like, you would have to replace the wood. Now,
*  if you replace the wood, is it still the same house? Like, there's arguments about boats.
*  Wayne Gibson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson They've found some ancient boats and they've done some rebuilding of these boats. Now,
*  also, you're looking at new wood in the shape of this old boat. Like, what is it now?
*  Wayne Gibson Is it? What is it?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Wayne Gibson So, I tell you, the first time I walked in there, which was 15 years ago,
*  you wouldn't have needed to do that much work to it.
*  Pete Slauson 15 years ago?
*  Wayne Gibson Yeah, you would have needed some bolstering for sure and the foundation would
*  have needed some work, but it has gone way downhill because nothing's been done to it. So, now,
*  I don't know, but when I walked in there, you really could have, a good carpenter and, you know,
*  carpenter team in a month, you could have shored that thing up.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ.
*  Wayne Gibson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson That's so sad.
*  Wayne Gibson Yeah, and I don't know how much of it. I mean, a lot of it was, the problem was with
*  all those holes in it, stuff had started to rot and rot is different than, you know.
*  And then, you would have to actually really replace that wood. So, at the end of the day,
*  it was going to be, a certain percentage of it was going to be new. But at least you could sort
*  of get a semblance of what it was and do your best to sort of, I mean, if you had like a real
*  good architect on hand and a real good engineer and someone from some sort of historical society
*  where they could look at it and say, okay, this is, we want to maintain as much of this old stuff
*  as possible while making sure this thing can last for more people to see it.
*  I think they could still do that, but I'm no expert. But there's plenty of it that you can
*  save. And there's things like, you know, there's that famous, it's in my book, it's a picture of
*  the table, Quanah's table there, and you've got the tin ceiling, that's still there and the floor
*  boards are still there and those are all the same, you know, the same stuff. So, I don't know. I'm no
*  expert on it. But until the owner, because it's his, until the owner decides to do something to it.
*  Come on, bro. What's his name? I think it's Wayne Gibson.
*  Wayne Gibson. Come on, Wayne. It's ridiculous.
*  He's a lovely guy. I'm sure he's a lovely guy.
*  He just doesn't want to do that.
*  Get your shit together, Wayne. It's a giant part of history. I mean, and particularly after you read
*  this story, read your book, it's just so much more interesting. You know, that mean that was the end,
*  that was when this guy had become a cattleman. That's when this guy had sort of assimilated
*  into not just assimilated, become incredibly successful. And, you know, I want to say western,
*  but western meaning, you know, the United States. It's not really what I keep using that word
*  probably incorrectly. What is the word to use when he's assimilated Eastern? Settler culture? Like,
*  what would you say when they assimilate into a white man's world? Would you just say that?
*  The white man's world? I suppose I guess the white man's
*  world is probably the best way. Anglo-European culture that had come west. But yeah, very much
*  the white man's world. The fact that he became a cattleman and becoming incredibly successful.
*  I thought it was hilarious too that they wanted him to not have so many wives.
*  They didn't want him to have the wives. They didn't want to have, you know, the braids,
*  the long, long braids. And I didn't like that, didn't like the wives. He quantitated things his
*  own way. He also played politics brilliantly. I mean, he understood from the early going that,
*  that quote, the chief of the Comanches was going to be appointed by the commander at Fort Sill.
*  You know, it wasn't just going to happen. And there were all sorts of candidates jostling
*  for this. And he made sure that it was him. That didn't make him any less the leader of his
*  tribe. It didn't make him any less of an independent person who the white men had
*  to deal with. But he made sure he had that one buttoned up and he was challenged continuously.
*  I mean, there was a, there were continuous challenge to him.
*  It's interesting historically that you don't hear about him and the Comanches when it played such
*  a significant part in taking over the West and settling the West. You hear about crazy
*  Horace. You hear about sitting bull. You hear about the, the Sue and the Apache's. You don't
*  hear that much about the Comanches and you don't hear much about Quanah Parker.
*  No, it was one of the great pleasures of writing this book is that these were largely unknown
*  things. I mean, if you, Quanah was one of them. Another, another discovery was, you know, every,
*  we all know about certain people running around San Antonio in the 1830s. J.
*  Davey Crockett would come to mind, but we don't know about Jack Hayes, the world's greatest,
*  you know, the ranger, the guy who sort of invented this anti-Commanche warfare, invented the repeating,
*  you know, he, he first he didn't invent, but he first used the repeating five shot pistol. And then
*  of course had a hand in the invention of the six shooter, but you, everybody should know who
*  Jack Hayes is. Everybody should know. I mean, Quanah was, I mean, Geronimo is Geronimo and
*  he's famous largely for one particular, particular breakout in the late 19th century. But you know,
*  Quanah was arguably the greater man in, in the reservation period. And, um, I mean, Geronimo
*  in some ways was kind of a, was kind of a curmudgeon. Yeah, that was another part that I
*  wanted to get to was Jack Hayes and the creation of the Texas Rangers. So we think of the Texas
*  Rangers today. We think of like Chuck Norris. You know, you really don't realize that they were
*  essentially a group that was created to effectively combat the Comanche. Exactly.
*  That's where they came from. It's amazing. The story, when you, when you talk about how
*  it took like sort of several iterations of these guys with, before they figured out how to do it
*  right. And the guys that came out, they're essentially a lot like, like a lot of depictions
*  of Navy SEALs, like renegades, like wild rugged rebels. And there they are. There's the original
*  Texas Rangers. Is that Jack Hayes in there? I don't see him.
*  Is he is San Antonio's military? There he is. There's Jack Hayes is,
*  well, the lightest picture. That's him. That's him right there.
*  Yeah. So Hayes, so, so the thing was, okay, San Antonio in the 1830s, late 1830s, you have,
*  you have about 2000 residents. It's the kind of the out, the final outpost on the frontier.
*  And what's happening is, Texas, which now owns the Texas, which now owns Texas, having won its
*  independence, is giving out what they call head rights. So if you want to get a head right,
*  meaning free land, so all you had to do to get your free land outside of San Antonio was go
*  survey the land. So you had to do and you had it, you know, and so the surveyors would go out
*  and survey it. And the Comanches would kill them in ever more imaginative ways,
*  because the Comanches understood exactly that the instruments did steal the land. The instruments
*  were the mechanism of the theft of the land from them. And so part of the deal was to keep, how can
*  you keep your surveyors alive? And Hayes was originally a surveyor, but he eventually just
*  got good at keeping other surveyors alive. And these guys who could do that eventually became
*  known as Rangers. And they evolved as Comanche fighters, you know, fighting like Comanches did.
*  I mean, they learned bird signs to track people. They would, you know, make cold camps. I mean,
*  you never made a warm, you never made a campfire if you were around Comanches. I mean, they would,
*  they learned these techniques and techniques of warfare. And they got really good at it.
*  They've just had this one problem. And the problem was that they had three shots.
*  They had Kentucky long rifle, bang, and two single shot pistols. And that's all they had
*  against Comanches who I would encourage all of your listeners to go and look up this guy,
*  Lars Anderson, on the internet. Yeah, he's the he's the bow guy. Yeah. Okay, so when him before he
*  what he proved among other things, he went back and he just researched it. And a lot of the things
*  that I frankly found hard to believe about Comanches. Once I saw the Anderson videos,
*  you believe them. Yes. Anderson can I think it's 10 arrows in five seconds. He there's no such
*  thing as a quiver, you're holding it as a bunch in your arm, you're I mean, but all these things
*  that we you know, we heard that the Comanches could do underneath the horse's neck and rapidity of
*  fire and and no one's ever Comanches never stood in one place and close one eye and shot. They never
*  once did that they were moving both eyes open. Anyway, look at the Anderson video. It's really
*  cool. But what that meant was that Jack Hayes and the Rangers were at an enormous disadvantage.
*  You know, and then lo and behold, he well cut to the East Coast, this inventor named Samuel Colt
*  come up in the in the early 1830s with a prototype of a it was a was a really ingenious little
*  pistol. It was a five shot pistol made in eventually made in Patterson, New Jersey.
*  There it is right there. Yeah. Is that the Patterson Colt? I hope so. It's just a five
*  shot chamber that was popping up with the same guy. So yeah, it doesn't look like the Patterson
*  Colt. But anyway, it's a five shot. It's a five shot thing with with revolving cylinders. And
*  as a great idea, right? Absolutely nobody wanted it. I mean, it was it was like a sidearm for
*  cavalry, but the US didn't have a cavalry. So it didn't really work out. For some reason, Mirabeau
*  Lamar, the president of Texas ordered 180 of these things, and they can they found their way to Texas,
*  the five shot Patterson Colts, and somehow Jack Hayes and his guys found out about them.
*  And they got ahold of them, they trained with them, and they immediately understood what it meant. It
*  meant equalizing the warfare against the Comanches. It meant because now they've they had they had a
*  five shots, one interchangeable cylinder, now 10, 10 shots in each pistol now. So in close hand combat,
*  the world changed. And, and not only did that world change, but eventually, everybody was so stunned by
*  what by this development that the US government ordered a lot of what ended up being Walker Colt
*  six shooters for the Mexican war. Colt becomes one of the richest men in America. And basically,
*  Jack Hayes and Rangers redefine warfare, which is which is and people said this about Jack Hayes,
*  and it's broadly speaking true before Jack Hayes, you know, people came into the West on foot,
*  carrying a Kentucky long rifle. And after Jack Hayes, they came mounted and carrying a six shooter.
*  Yeah, that was the other thing that was really shocking was that the US soldiers would try to
*  get off their horse to to engage. Right. Right. Because they didn't think you fought mount the
*  only people who fought mounted were the Plains Indians. I mean, nobody thought you've fighting
*  mounted was not something anybody did. If you if you used a horse, you used it in the dragoon way,
*  which is you would ride to where you were going to fight, get off the horse and then fight.
*  The but command she's were fully mounted in Rangers were fully mounted and what they what they
*  use the Texas Rangers for in the Mexican war, which is they were there was terrible gorilla
*  problems. And these Rangers just went and cleared out these whole areas and nobody had seen
*  this type of warfare before. Nobody had seen this kind of ability to fight and move and move
*  mounted and move with these well, I nobody ever seen these, these Walker Colts, these five pound
*  hand cannon six shooters that they had nobody had seen those either. And so these crazy these
*  these Rangers addressed any way they wanted to, you know, sometimes with no shirts on and
*  Sarah pays and crazy hats. I mean, they were just the Rangers there. Everybody was scared to death.
*  Do we know the history of the bow and arrow amongst the Native Americans? Do we know when
*  it was first implemented? I'm not an expert on it. I mean, I, I don't know. Because I don't know if
*  the way the Lars Anderson style of shooting of keeping all the the arrows in the fingers
*  that he researched, did he research that from Native Americans? Or was that ever utilized in
*  Europe or anywhere else? His research is I think he started and I don't I'm not an expert on him
*  either. But I think he started with other I mean, he started reading about, you know, anybody who
*  were, you know, who are archers and famous for it and descriptions of them. And I believe I'm sure
*  that that did include Native Americans, but it was no it was a whole he looked at the whole world.
*  Pete Slauson And so do you think Native American, well, we don't know, but I'm just speculating,
*  did Native Americans develop disability independently? Or did they did they learn
*  it from anyone else? Like, it seems interesting that they were living, particularly the Comanches,
*  this incredible nomadic life, and didn't really have a lot of interaction with other people from
*  other places.
*  Pete Slauson The first interaction from from anywhere else is 16th century Spain.
*  Pete Slauson And they already had bow and arrows by then.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, and there's no, that's the first interaction with Europeans.
*  So, the question is, did the bow come over in the land bridge? Did it? I mean, I don't know,
*  I really, not my field, but.
*  Pete Slauson No, of course, it's just, it's so interesting because I don't know that style of
*  multiple shooting of being able to shoot so many arrows in a row had been, I don't think it was
*  implemented by the Europeans. Maybe the Mongols, did they have?
*  Pete Slauson I don't know. The question though, the more, the question you're getting at is,
*  how did the Comanches in particular, because when these Dodge and Catlin and these various
*  people saw Comanches in Texas in 1830s, they just flat couldn't believe what they were looking at.
*  They couldn't believe their abilities with horses breaking them.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I've never seen anything like it before. Never seen anything like it before.
*  Pete Slauson No saddle either, right?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, they did have a saddle. Yeah, that was part of the Spanish technology. Very,
*  very, very minimal. You'll see it in museums, but.
*  Pete Slauson Do you see if you can find one of those?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, a Spanish saddle or anyway, but yeah, they had, and particularly the shooting.
*  Pete Slauson There it is right there. Wow.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, very, very minimal. See how, right, minimal, yes. And one of the ways they
*  could shoot underneath the neck of the horse was to hang a thong off the side of one of the saddles.
*  Pete Slauson A thong?
*  Pete Slauson Well, a loop, a leather loop. A leather loop that would allow them because
*  otherwise they would need to be supported as they came down underneath.
*  Pete Slauson And they were fairly small people, right?
*  Pete Slauson They were fairly small people.
*  Pete Slauson So, they would kind of climb off the saddle and hang on the side?
*  Pete Slauson Hang on the side, full gallop, full gallop,
*  shooting accurately arrows that would kill a man 30 yards underneath the neck.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Pete Slauson But people, so the question there, I don't know the answer to that,
*  and I don't know that anyone does. What the white men saw just absolutely floored them
*  with abilities with arrows. And among other things, they would ask the Indian boys,
*  they set up a dime in a tree or a coin and they go, okay, now here, you stand here and close your
*  eyes and aim and hit that. The Comanche boy would miss it by a foot.
*  Pete Slauson Look at that picture right there of them
*  doing the action. That's incredible.
*  Pete Slauson Underneath the…
*  Pete Slauson So, they're basically using the horse as a shield.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's the whole idea.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Pete Slauson And if you see them from the other side, I've seen trick riders do this,
*  you can't even see them from the other side of the horse.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Pete Slauson And again, this was something that trick riders after,
*  in the Wild West shows and beyond, would do these sorts of things.
*  Pete Slauson I'm sorry, so go back to what you're saying. So,
*  when they were standing still…
*  Pete Slauson Oh, so with the Comanche boy, they asked him to shoot that dime. The Comanche
*  boy wouldn't hit. He was playing by their rules. They wanted him to stand and aim and whatever.
*  And again, if you see the Lars Anderson videos, there was no such thing as closing one eye. There
*  was no such thing almost as standing still and shooting. It was constant movement. It was
*  shooting from movement wherever they were going.
*  Pete Slauson So, they were really accurate that way.
*  Pete Slauson So, it was sort of like the member in
*  Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where they say, here's Sundance, try to hit that. And, you know,
*  Sundance Kid shoots at it and misses it. And then on his way out, he moves. He says,
*  you mind if I move or something or I'm better if I move? It's the same deal.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson It was all about movement and it was never about anything stationary.
*  Anyway, so yeah, all that. That, to answer, I have no idea how they got good at that.
*  Pete Slauson That's a real shame that they don't have a written history.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson I mean, that's one of many, many things.
*  That's a real shame that they don't have a written history. And I would have loved to have seen
*  someone be able to do that. I mean, God, how incredible would it be to see what it looked like
*  to see them? I mean, we just missed the motion picture by 67 years. You got to think they were
*  doing it for hundreds, hundreds and hundreds of years. It's almost like just too magical to
*  capture. Sorry, it's gone. Gone right before you'd invent a camera. I mean, at least we have some
*  photos, some still photos. Pete Slauson
*  We do. And we have, and I put in pretty big chunks of text into my book of people of the time who
*  saw them and who described it. That's all you can do is just what they saw and how astounded they
*  were when they were looking at it. Pete Slauson
*  So, you must have been pretty excited when you saw that Lars Andersen guy.
*  Oh, yeah. Because, you know, I –
*  Pete Slauson Pull that guy up. Pull up a video of that guy so we
*  could watch it because it is pretty amazing. Pete Slauson
*  Because, I mean, it's not that I didn't believe what I was reading, but on some level,
*  it's hard to believe that they can do what people said they could do.
*  Pete Slauson It's interesting because this guy gets hated
*  on a lot in the archery community. It's very funny because, you know, they say that a lot of
*  what he's doing is tricks and a lot of what he's doing is nonsense. And, you know, it's not really
*  true that people actually did that. Pete Slauson
*  But watch him do it. Pete Slauson
*  Yes, I said that. Pete Slauson
*  Okay, man. Unless that's a trick. I mean –
*  Pete Slauson It's not a trick. He's clearly doing what
*  he's saying he's doing. There's no ifs ands or buts about it. Are they tricks in terms of like,
*  is it something that maybe wouldn't be as effective but it's really cool to see? Yeah,
*  for sure. But so what? So what? He's still showing you that you can do things. I mean,
*  but he throws a ball and then shoots – look at it, he shoots it with his – look at that,
*  he shoots it in the head with his foot. Pete Slauson
*  He's also the rate of discharge, which is one of the things I had trouble believing.
*  When you see him shoot, he's just – it's one every half second.
*  Pete Slauson Throws it, catches it, and he can shoot an
*  arrow like right after he catches it. Look at that, how he throws something in the air and then
*  shoots two shots. Two. He throws it in the air and then by the time it hits the ground, he hits it
*  twice. I mean, it's incredible. And he's really accurate with this thing.
*  He also, one of his cases is that, you know, he is always moving, it's continuous movement. He
*  doesn't close one eye, he doesn't stand still, he is moving all the time.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Everywhere he goes, which is what he said was the trademark of the great,
*  the Magyars and the great, you know, archer cultures.
*  Pete Slauson Look at this, jumps in the air, gets off an arrow
*  before he hits the ground. I mean, amazing. And he's even catching arrows and then shooting them
*  back. Like, anybody that says that what he's doing is nonsense is a fool. Like, look, I'm an
*  archer.
*  Pete Slauson He's plainly doing it.
*  Pete Slauson You are an archer?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's why I have that archery
*  range back there.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, okay, so you've got it.
*  Pete Slauson I'm a bowhunter.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Well, okay, that's –
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. This is really impressive stuff. I mean, I don't shoot traditional archery.
*  I shoot a compound bow with a sight and I can line it up to the exact yardage and all that stuff.
*  But I know enough to know that what this guy's doing is pretty special. So, he's showing arrows
*  in the quiver versus arrows in his hand, how he can just grab them and pull them.
*  Pete Slauson Right. So, his case is that we all think that it's a quiver, right?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson He says nobody who was any good ever used a quiver.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson You can transport them in a quiver, but in battle,
*  you're holding them in a bunch, a clustered bunch in your hand.
*  Pete Slauson Right. And he's showing that.
*  Pete Slauson Just the way we're seeing these people here.
*  Pete Slauson In these ancient depictions, the actual drawings
*  from, you know, hundreds of years ago of the way he did it, holding the arrows in his draw hand.
*  And so, he can do it very quickly. Really interesting.
*  Pete Slauson It is.
*  Pete Slauson Really interesting. And this is probably, I mean,
*  because of this one gentleman, it's probably the only way we're really going to know that this was
*  possible. Because no one else is doing anything like this guy. Look at this. He's doing drive-bys
*  on the back of a bike and he hits, I mean, back that up again so you can see that because that
*  is insane. Watch how he's doing this right there. I mean, three times he hits in a second,
*  he hits three targets on a bike as he's riding by, which would emulate a horse other than the
*  difference between the elevation change. You know, you go up and down on a horse.
*  But that was the other thing about like the stories of the Mongols that they had developed
*  an ability to shoot as the horse was in the air because it wouldn't, like the stomping of the
*  horse's hooves would…
*  Pete Slauson Oh, I see. During that pause.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. So, as the horse was up, that's when they would release. So, it would have the
*  least amount of impact on their accuracy. It's pretty incredible stuff.
*  Pete Slauson But it's one of the things that made Comanche's Comanche is the mastery of the horse
*  plus that would now combine with this ability to shoot from a moving horse.
*  Pete Slauson Now, did they have a particular prowess with
*  archery that was known amongst Native Americans? Was it extraordinary amongst other tribes?
*  Pete Slauson I don't know that for a fact, but I do know the reaction of people who saw them,
*  who had seen plenty of other Indians, nobody had ever seen anything like it at the time.
*  Now, was there a group of Northern Plains Indians that could do it? I don't know. But the reaction
*  was almost universal by people who had seen a lot of Indian tribes and, you know, they'd never seen
*  that before.
*  Pete Slauson Someone needs to make a movie.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson You know, I mean, someone really needs to make a movie about Cynthia and Parker,
*  about Kwana, about the Comanche, just about what it must have been like for these poor hapless
*  settlers that didn't know they were being used as a meat buffer. You know, the whole story.
*  Pete Slauson Well, you know, Warner Brothers has been working on this for nine years.
*  Pete Slauson Have they?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. Maybe one day, they came, as I understand it, very close.
*  Pete Slauson See, this book came out nine years ago.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Pete Slauson So, that's when Warner Brothers was?
*  Pete Slauson Right. And the first screenwriter was Larry McMurtry. It was very famous, you know,
*  if you had to pick a screenwriter, it would be Larry McMurtry. And Hollywood, well, you know,
*  you're in the middle of the, you're in the belly of the beast here. You know what it's like.
*  Hollywood just does what it does. I mean, there are two modes here, I think, hair on fire and
*  glacier. And I've been through both of them over these years.
*  Pete Slauson Maybe we can get your hair on fire again.
*  Pete Slauson But no, we've got a great screenplay now,
*  and I didn't write, but you know, Derek C. and Francis, the director has been attached to it.
*  Pete Slauson Are you happy with it though?
*  Pete Slauson I am extremely. I didn't think it was possible to do a two-hour movie about that.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
*  So, what they did is they basically made it about Mackenzie and Quana. It's just flat brilliant.
*  And I think, as I'm told, even though I wasn't part of it, they came pretty close last summer to
*  doing this, but the budget was too high. And the budget was so high, I think, that they thought
*  that the only way they could make their money back is if they had Batman or Wonder Woman in it. But
*  that might wreck the atmosphere. But yeah, I'd love to see it get done. And it is a wonderful
*  screenplay, and we'll see. Pete Slauson
*  No, listen, it's more than that. It's an amazing book, and I can't recommend it enough.
*  It changed the way I felt and thought about this whole thing of these settlers traveling across
*  the country and encountering these Native American tribes. It completely changed my whole perspective
*  of that era in time. Pete Slauson
*  Well, it's that the needle sort of swings both ways on this, on the question of
*  Native Americans. And there, as I said, there was sort of a school that was dominant. Well,
*  if you actually go back, you have kind of a mid-century impression that, you know,
*  sort of the Indians are all bad, and the army is good, right? The cavalry is riding out, right?
*  That kind of idea of Indians. And then you have the bury my heart at wounded knee, which is the
*  needle swinging the other way. These people are victims. The army is all evil, which wasn't true
*  either. And it kind of swings, it swings between one untruth to another untruth, but the actual
*  truth is somewhere in the middle. Pete Slauson
*  And you do a great job at depicting that. Like, you talk about the horrific crimes that particular
*  army people did do. Yeah. Pete Slauson
*  Yeah, so there's no, in my book, I'm, I, objectively speaking, both sides are responsible
*  for atrocities. And, you know, one of the things the Rangers learned was no quarter. You know,
*  no quarter isn't, you know, when you, when you, if you, if you can imagine all the way into an
*  attack on an Indian village as men, women, and children in an, and imagine what no quarter looks
*  like. It's not very pretty. And that was certainly Comanche way of doing things. And that was the
*  Texas Rangers way of doing things when fighting Comanche. So, yeah, you have, you have, and, and
*  any number of great massacres perpetrated against, against Comanches and other Indian tribes.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it's, I mean, it's, it's amazing. I
*  can't recommend it enough. Have you thought about writing any other books on Native Americans,
*  or is there any other subjects like this that you'd like to tackle?
*  Pete Slauson You know, I, I, I would have probably. This
*  book became very successful, and then there was a wave of other books that, there were really not
*  very many books at all before it about this particular Native culture. But then there was
*  a big wave of them after, right afterward, which inspired by the success of this book.
*  Pete Slauson Any good ones?
*  Pete Slauson Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson What was a good one?
*  Pete Slauson Let's see. The Center of Everything That Is,
*  The Heart of Everything That Is, which is, which was a version, well, not a version, but it was a,
*  it was a kind of doing for the Sioux what, what this book did. That might have been a choice of
*  mine, for example, would be to go, hey, I'll do the Sioux in Northern Plains Indians, won't that
*  be great? But there were some books like that. But The Heart of Everything That Is is a very,
*  I would recommend that one. There was another book actually that came out just before mine called
*  Blood and Thunder that's quite good. But anyway, it preempted me on some of the choices I might
*  have made. But I'd like to return to it. I've been in the Civil War now for a few years and
*  writing about the Civil War. I have a new book out called Hymns of the Republic about the final
*  year of the war. I wrote a biography of Stonewall Jackson and so I've been kind of, I took a right
*  turn. Actually, because this book was very successful, I mean, sometimes when you're
*  successful, a window opens and maybe it's never going to open again. And that window,
*  in this case, was that I could maybe do what I wanted to do. And so I picked Stonewall Jackson,
*  just because I wanted to do Stonewall Jackson. And so that made me a right angle turn into the
*  Civil War, where I've been for a while. But I'd love any answers. I'd love to return to Native
*  America. Well, it's a whole genre of film in this country, which is so interesting, right? The West,
*  the Wild West movies. I mean, it's a gigantic genre, of course, Clint Eastwood and so many
*  other great movies. And even the Civil War, there's so many stories, we're trying to tell
*  this insane story of what this country was and what it became and how quickly it all happened.
*  It's so hard for us when you're born, me, I was born on the East Coast, you know, you live around
*  cities, seems normal. And then you start hearing about the West and then you start, like as you're
*  growing up, you start learning about cowboys and Indians and what have, but you get this sort of
*  weird version of it. Where I mean, in high school, they barely taught you anything,
*  nothing comprehensive, nothing anything remotely touching on your book. And then as I got older,
*  and I started getting in it more and more, it became this really weird puzzle to me until I
*  read your book. And your book was actually listen to it on audio tape. And it was one of the most
*  sort of paradigm shifting. It just completely shifted my perspective on how it happened.
*  Well, I'm glad. I'm glad you experienced it that way.
*  I think people need to hear it.
*  It was, it is, it is a bit of, I mean, I think from my point of view, it's a bit of me being
*  too dumb or naive to know any better. I mean, I just went in as a reporter and reported
*  without any particular agenda, not because I'm a noble person, but just because I just didn't
*  have any agenda. I just reported the book and I thought this is interesting and this is interesting.
*  And, and just laying that out actually means you're avoiding these sort of ideological extremes that,
*  you know, that of whatever it may be that, that is painting a picture that isn't quite accurate for
*  some other reason. So anyway.
*  Has anybody written a good book on crazy horse?
*  Um, not that I can, Larry McMurtry wrote a pretty good book about crazy horse, a small volume. I'm
*  trying to remember, there was a book a few years about crazy horse, but anyway, the McMurtry book
*  is pretty good. Yeah. Um, so, but so basically, so you may go back to this sort of subject.
*  I may, if I could find, if I could find, uh, you know, the right subject. Um, so Jack Hayes was
*  something I could still go back to. Jack Hayes was a really interesting guy. Um, yeah. Oh,
*  that seemed like when you were talking about in the book, like this could be a whole other
*  avenue that you could take. I could see going back to Jack Hayes because he,
*  he continues to intersect with native America all, all through his life. Um, and anyway, so we'll
*  just the whole idea of going from, uh, a surveyor to protecting surveyors to becoming the original
*  Texas ranger, which is one of the main Texas rangers, one of the most iconic groups of humans
*  in the history of this country. He was the Uber ranger. He was the man. He was like five foot,
*  eight, five foot, nine slender, the high voice, you know, just a bad motherfucker. Man was he bad.
*  And he had all these, you know, these giant rangers, really mean people. I mean,
*  he's with people. You did not want to pick the fight within the Western bar, you know,
*  complete deference. Yeah. Well, that was what was fascinating about is like they had put together
*  these sort of outcasts and those are the ones that were able to do the job and not only able,
*  but they, nobody else would do it. I mean, these were 23 year old guys who didn't have families and
*  who just didn't give a shit about anything. They were happy to be out in the field for six months
*  without pay, which was often true. I mean, they often just didn't get paid. Um, they weren't,
*  they weren't armed. They weren't paid. They weren't any, there's just, and they wanted to
*  fight Indians. I mean, how many, how many 41 year olds, you know, want to do that? You know,
*  it's just such a wild group of humans, you know? Yeah. I really do hope you, uh, write a book about
*  that. Well, that would be a, I've often thought of pursuing that one and that gets into other
*  native American areas. So well, listen, man, I mean, just what, just being able to talk about it,
*  on here, I'm hoping that it gives it a boost again. Well, thank you for whatever. I'm so glad you like
*  it. It, uh, it's, it's a great subject in it. And it, it, in some ways, I think the reason I
*  maybe was, was it mainly attracted to it is it told you what happened in the American West on some
*  level through this one lens. Yeah. Which is pretty cool. You knocked it out of the park, man. Thank
*  you. And thanks for coming here. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye everybody.
*  Well, that was painless. Thank you.
