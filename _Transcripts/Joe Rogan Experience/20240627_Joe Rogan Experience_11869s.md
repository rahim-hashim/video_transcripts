*  other side of the face. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  There's so much jargon and lingo that goes with like psychedelic talk that leads to like [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=63.28s)]
*  cults. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=68.96s)]

*  It doesn't matter where. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=87.92s)]
*  It's the I did a joke one time that every cult at some point the leader of every religious [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=88.92s)]
*  cult says hey, God spoke to me and he says I got to fuck all your wives. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=96.04s)]
*  Without fail. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=104.48s)]
*  Every single thing across the board. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=106.32000000000001s)]

*  I decided now's the time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=113.28s)]
*  This one was different because it's a female leader. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=114.76s)]
*  And it was based on orgasm but this one was like you got to fuck him if you're having [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=118.24s)]
*  a hard time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=123.16s)]
*  It was like the opposite of HR where it was you know you should if you have a problem [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=124.16s)]
*  with him you got to fuck him. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=130.48s)]
*  There's a place here that was a cult and the building was for sale. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=133.2s)]
*  I almost bought the building. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=138.04s)]

*  Yeah, it's the documentary is called Holy Hell. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=143.48s)]
*  I still haven't watched it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=146.04s)]
*  It's on my list. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=147.28s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=148.28s)]
*  It started out in Los Angeles and this guy was he would get his male disciples and he [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=150.56s)]
*  would give them therapy make them pay for therapy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=160.48s)]
*  It's like 50 bucks and then he would fuck another hallmark. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like pyramid scheme. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  I got a hey bad news. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=170.35999999999999s)]

*  I don't know what to say. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=172.84s)]
*  You want to be in there? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=173.84s)]
*  Give you a real therapy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=174.84s)]
*  Part of the group or not? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=175.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=176.84s)]
*  But it's just so sad like listen to these guys tell the story. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=177.84s)]
*  It's like there's some weird thing about human beings where they gravitate towards a big [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=182.8s)]
*  leader but towards someone who claims they have the answers and seems very confident [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=189.28000000000003s)]
*  and can speak reasonably well. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=196.12s)]
*  There's almost like a cheat code where people just like they get locked into that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=199.08s)]
*  It feels like order. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=203.2s)]
*  It just feels like order. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=205.28s)]
*  If you go if somebody says I know and they're tall. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=206.72s)]
*  First of all, if they're tall that gets you like 60% of the way there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=212.8s)]
*  That helps. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=216.76s)]
*  If they're tall and says I know what we should do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=217.76s)]
*  Good look charismatic, good looking fit, attractive to women like that'll it just makes you feel [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=220.52s)]
*  like a daddy's here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=228.7s)]
*  Some daddy's here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=231.33999999999997s)]
*  A different daddy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=232.5s)]
*  It's like oh all right that's what people like about Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=233.61999999999998s)]
*  That's what people like about Obama. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  Most presidents are some form of that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=238.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=242.06s)]
*  With Reagan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=243.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=244.06s)]
*  Certainly two-termers. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=245.06s)]
*  George W. Bush in a weird way. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=246.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=248.94s)]
*  George W. Bush, guy walked like he had a fucking two-foot cock. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=252.42s)]
*  Guy walked like he had to leave room for two dicks. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=261.14s)]
*  That's how wide his gait was and he said he used to practice it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=264.97999999999996s)]
*  George W. Bush used to practice his gait. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=269.26s)]
*  You look it up. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=271.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=272.82s)]
*  He'd been talking about it in interviews. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=273.82s)]
*  You can imagine walking around your house practicing your impressive walk. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=274.82s)]
*  Yeah well that can you imagine anyone more than him doing it? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=280.66s)]
*  Like the exact guy that would do that like a practice walk. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=284.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=289.5s)]
*  Bush's renewed confidence is 2005. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=290.5s)]
*  Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger which in Texas is called walking. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=295.18s)]
*  That's how President Bush described himself during his acceptance speech at last year's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=300.94s)]
*  Republican National Convention in New York City but for much this year the president [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=304.82000000000005s)]
*  seemed to have lost the... [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=309.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=311.02s)]
*  That's just... [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=312.02s)]
*  Yeah but I've seen other interviews where he talked about actually practicing his walk. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=313.02s)]
*  Well they were originally from Maine. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=318.02s)]
*  They were like kind of fake Texans. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  Come on Joe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=322.78s)]
*  Yeah they were from Kentbunkport. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=323.78s)]
*  No I know. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=324.78s)]
*  They couldn't be more blue blood. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=325.78s)]
*  George Bush Sr. was head of the CIA. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=329.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=332.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=333.41999999999996s)]
*  Which is weird now. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  I wonder if that would help him now politically. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=336.06s)]
*  I was the head of the CIA. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=338.74s)]
*  Didn't hurt him then. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=342.26s)]
*  Didn't hurt him but only one term. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=343.74s)]
*  Yeah but that was because of what's his face? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=345.46000000000004s)]

*  That guy he fucking threw the whole thing out the window. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=353.86s)]
*  When he bought television time like prime time television time he was like I'll just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=358.62s)]
*  I'll just buy a whole hour and gave the networks money so they could run his speech and talk [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=364.46s)]
*  about how you're getting fucked by the IRS. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=369.78s)]

*  Absolutely. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=377.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=378.06s)]
*  He made himself go viral and he appealed to people that were not... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=379.06s)]

*  How much did that one decision that that one manager make cost Starbucks by changing their [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=575.3s)]
*  policy allowing homeless people to just linger around smell like shit. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=582.26s)]
*  Did they officially change their policy. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=586.7s)]
*  Yeah they officially changed it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=588.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=590.02s)]

*  A giant one. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=592.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=593.7s)]
*  I was I read a thing last night that there's it's like similar but different where there's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=594.7s)]
*  so many people quit working at hospitals that there's now incredibly long waits at hospitals [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=601.98s)]
*  like now and cove it's like low. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=610.6999999999999s)]
*  Well they fired so many of them because they wouldn't get vaccinated. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=614.3s)]
*  Oh they did. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=617.38s)]
*  The thing I read said that 300000 people quit in the last in 2020 and 2021. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=618.38s)]
*  Well I'm sure there's that too. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=625.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=626.74s)]
*  So there's quitting too. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=627.74s)]
*  But a lot of them just they they had the option get vaccinated or lose your job and they're [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=628.74s)]
*  like what. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=633.02s)]
*  We went through this when there was no vaccine. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=634.02s)]
*  We all got covid you fucks. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=637.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=638.98s)]
*  We're in here every day and now you're going to make us get vaccinated when there's no [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=640.3000000000001s)]
*  science behind it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=644.1800000000001s)]
*  We literally have antibodies that are seven times better than what you get from the vaccine [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=645.98s)]
*  and you're making people get vaccinated just for what for a virtue signal for so you can [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=649.4200000000001s)]
*  tell everybody that everyone's vaccinated. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=656.1s)]
*  Like there's zero science behind that and they all like these were our heroes that were [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=658.46s)]
*  on the front lines and then they fired them. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=663.1s)]
*  If you were the if you were the king of the earth or let's say king of America which some [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  would say you are if you're the king of America what how would you have handled covid from [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=671.7s)]
*  February 20 20. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=677.98s)]
*  Like what would you have done because I feel like we all have like I don't like that I [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=680.46s)]
*  don't like that I don't like that. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=683.98s)]
*  I don't know what the better solution would have been especially when you consider stuff [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=685.46s)]
*  like hospitals and quitting and deaths you know triot like where in at one point Wuhan [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=691.98s)]
*  was going to build they built that hospital in a week which America just can't do shit [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=697.58s)]
*  like that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=702.02s)]
*  To me it was always a hospital bed issue. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=703.02s)]
*  Well in some ways the problem it's a health issue right. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=707.5s)]
*  And you're dealing with vast swaths of the population that have very fragile bodies very [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=713.82s)]
*  fragile bad people that are in bad health. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=719.9s)]

*  That's a lot of people. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=723.9000000000001s)]
*  You have never cared it's I would say it was it forty five percent of Americans are obese. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=724.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah something like that somewhere in the neighborhood and you know and that's just [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=729.34s)]
*  obesity then you have these people that maybe they're not obese but they have terrible blood [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=734.4200000000001s)]

*  COVID. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=749.5s)]
*  No matter what anybody did it was going to be bad for those people. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=750.5s)]
*  There is no if ands or buts about it no matter what anybody did that disease was going to [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=754.22s)]
*  wreck people with damaged immune systems. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=758.94s)]
*  It was just and especially overweight. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=761.6600000000001s)]
*  A plurality of people almost half to say nothing of just old people. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=763.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=768.1s)]
*  I would argue there's more let's go 60 40 unhealthy to healthy in America you can almost [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=769.1s)]
*  go 70 30. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=773.58s)]

*  But the the thing about COVID in that regard is that there is really no solution that made [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=787.74s)]
*  any sense. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=794.92s)]
*  Like when there was no vaccine and the medications were confusing it was hard to know what was [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=796.26s)]
*  real and what was in hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin and you know what about monoclonal [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=801.52s)]
*  antibodies and all these different. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=806.5s)]
*  It was always never clear what did what. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=808.22s)]
*  Yeah it's very very dangerous whenever you have a new disease because you do have people [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=810.0200000000001s)]
*  trying these off label medications and some of them work and some of them don't. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=814.82s)]
*  And then you have a lot of pressure from the companies that are producing vaccines because [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=818.58s)]
*  they only they want a binary solution because that's where all the cash is. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=822.0200000000001s)]
*  And then you have the emergency use exemption which the only way you get that emergency [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=825.46s)]
*  use exemption is if there is no treatment that's available. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=829.7800000000001s)]
*  That's that's that works. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=833.7800000000001s)]
*  So if you are the person that's in charge and you stand to make untold billions of dollars [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=835.54s)]
*  from the vaccine which they did they suppress any information. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=843.0s)]
*  I don't disagree with that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=847.1s)]
*  I'm wondering it with that playing field. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=848.46s)]
*  What do you do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=851.78s)]
*  What does the king do. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=852.78s)]
*  You definitely don't shut the country down. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=853.78s)]
*  You definitely don't. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=855.58s)]
*  I thought sometimes I think that and then I look at 300000 people quitting health care [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=856.58s)]
*  and I'm like that's an unforeseen consequence. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=861.5s)]
*  Do you know what I mean. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=864.54s)]
*  Like how about the restaurants. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=865.54s)]
*  How about the small businesses. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=866.54s)]
*  So much of the suicide. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=868.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=869.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=870.8599999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=871.8599999999999s)]
*  Drug drug abuse and drug overdose. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=872.8599999999999s)]
*  And that's from shutdown from shutdown. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=874.2199999999999s)]
*  So and then you go well what if we don't shut it down. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=876.78s)]
*  Then you get Florida. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=879.9399999999999s)]
*  Florida had deaths. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=882.14s)]
*  But if you look at it Florida first of all is very old. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=883.54s)]
*  A lot of old people. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=887.14s)]
*  And if you adjust by age Florida did better than a lot of other states. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=889.14s)]
*  What what they did was say we're going to protect our elderly protect our vulnerable [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=894.42s)]
*  and everything stays open and everyone's like you're crazy. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=899.22s)]
*  Everyone's going to die. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=903.5799999999999s)]
*  And it turns out no. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=904.5799999999999s)]
*  It turns out they were right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=905.5799999999999s)]
*  And the economy there didn't suffer. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=907.34s)]
*  In fact real estate went through the roof. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=909.74s)]
*  I mean that was everywhere. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=911.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=913.5799999999999s)]
*  Well there in particular because a lot of people moved there. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=914.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean their economy did well. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=917.0600000000001s)]
*  You know same thing with Texas. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=919.02s)]
*  They did it and shut down. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=920.5s)]
*  I mean they shut down for a little bit. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=921.7s)]
*  And then they were like you know we're going to open up and we're going to be cautious [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=923.66s)]
*  and you should be careful of your own health. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=926.1s)]
*  And if you're a person who's vulnerable take care of yourself. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=928.14s)]
*  Do whatever you want to do. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=931.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  I guess it's just the downstream effects of that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=933.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's you know. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=934.94s)]
*  You just can't shut the whole country down and expect that everything's going to be fine [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=936.98s)]
*  when you start it back up again. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=941.66s)]
*  You disastrous results. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=943.1800000000001s)]
*  Whenever the economy crashes like like it did with that you have all these other unforeseen [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=945.1s)]
*  side effects of that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=952.4599999999999s)]
*  And you know a big one is people's mental health and anxiety and like how's that going [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=954.4599999999999s)]
*  to affect the rest of their life. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=958.62s)]
*  When someone works for 20 30 years on a business and you have a business and it's up and running [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=960.38s)]
*  and it's getting by you're making a profit. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=965.42s)]
*  And then also the government comes along and says you have to shut this business down and [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=968.34s)]
*  maybe you've already had covid and maybe you got maybe you were one of the lucky ones where [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=972.8199999999999s)]
*  it wasn't that big of a deal and you got over it and you're like OK I got anybody's now [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=977.06s)]
*  I'm not worried. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=981.1s)]
*  And now the government tells you you can't work. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=982.5799999999999s)]
*  You cannot. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=984.5s)]
*  It's against the law. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=985.9s)]
*  If you do you'll be arrested. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=986.9s)]
*  It's madness. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=987.9s)]
*  It's unprecedented. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=988.9s)]
*  It never happened. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=989.9s)]
*  I agree. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=990.9s)]
*  I don't think it's what hasn't happened. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=991.9s)]
*  It hasn't happened in probably since the flu. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=993.74s)]
*  That was the problem. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=996.26s)]
*  That was the that was the problem is shutting things down and telling people what they can't [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=997.38s)]
*  do. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1001.1s)]
*  And also having this like blanket solution for people whether they're 80 and fat or whether [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1002.4200000000001s)]
*  they're 20 and fit which is nuts. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1008.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1011.62s)]
*  You can't treat all bodies like they're exactly the same thing. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1012.62s)]
*  That makes zero sense. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1016.0600000000001s)]
*  It's I it's as a leader. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1017.5s)]
*  You kind of have to though. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1021.3000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1022.78s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1023.78s)]
*  You kind of have it does have to be one size fits all somewhat. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1024.78s)]
*  Yeah but you don't you don't have to impose restrictions. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1027.5s)]
*  You could tell people that these are the best suggestions in terms of what we should do [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1032.22s)]
*  to preserve health. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1038.22s)]
*  But the reality of respiratory viruses is you cannot contain them. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1039.3400000000001s)]
*  They've never been contained. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1043.38s)]
*  No one has ever successfully contained a respiratory virus. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1044.8200000000002s)]
*  If people are allowed to walk and they're allowed to talk and they're allowed to eat [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1048.5800000000002s)]
*  they're gonna fucking spread it no matter what draconian rules they put down in Australia [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1052.7s)]
*  or in China. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1058.0600000000002s)]
*  It fucking spreads. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1059.46s)]
*  It burns through the people. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1060.5s)]
*  And then I mean a lot of virologists and people that are experts in respiratory diseases were [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1062.22s)]
*  saying this at the very beginning of the pandemic. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1069.7s)]
*  They were saying listen this this has got to burn through the population. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1072.9s)]
*  And most people didn't want to accept that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1077.66s)]
*  They were like that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1079.54s)]
*  No there's got to be a better way. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1080.54s)]
*  No there's no better way. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1081.74s)]
*  When you have a virus that spreads through people breathing on each other it just burns [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1083.22s)]
*  through people. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1088.54s)]
*  If you have the option to be on a ranch if you've got a ranch in Texas and you got all [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1090.3s)]
*  your food out there and water and you can just fucking stay by yourself for two years [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1096.1s)]
*  yeah you'll be okay. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1101.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1102.58s)]
*  That's kind of what Howard Stern did right. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1103.58s)]
*  I don't even know if he did that. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1104.58s)]
*  Went to the Hamptons and just stayed put. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1105.58s)]
*  Built a studio out there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1109.34s)]
*  Did his show from out there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1111.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1112.54s)]
*  Never I mean there was a photo of him at a restaurant like recently. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1113.54s)]
*  It was like the first time he's out in two years. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1116.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1119.3s)]
*  I just didn't it was I not like I felt bad for the I just don't know what I don't know [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1120.3s)]
*  who did it well. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1127.54s)]
*  Do you know what I mean. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1128.54s)]
*  Like I don't know what country did it well. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1129.78s)]
*  Whenever I go Sweden and then you all these things when you do when you start clicking [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1132.02s)]
*  links you're like that seems inconclusive or contradictory or it always struck me as [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1136.3s)]
*  just we don't have the infrastructure for that many sick people. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1142.62s)]
*  Yeah there's that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1146.3799999999999s)]
*  That's part of it. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1147.54s)]
*  There's also. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1149.6599999999999s)]
*  And the wear and tear of like you can't make a nurse that like you're a nurse you can't [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1151.78s)]
*  just certify it's like being a pilot like you have it takes a fucking long time. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1158.18s)]
*  And that's what they're running to get up against now like big hot like one of them [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1162.7s)]
*  is like Mass General last week like a huge hospital in Massachusetts in Boston. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1166.02s)]
*  Then there's people lined up in the hallway last week because there's not enough nurses. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1172.28s)]
*  There was one story in the article I read that was like they have 200 openings at a [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1176.82s)]
*  hospital and no applicants. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1182.26s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1184.22s)]

*  No applicants. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1186.6599999999999s)]
*  Well imagine if you're a person who's dedicated yourself to health care work and then they [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1187.6599999999999s)]
*  come along and say you have to get vaccinated or you're getting fired and you just gone [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1192.06s)]
*  through the pandemic you caught covid maybe you caught it twice. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1196.62s)]
*  I would also argue that there's that and then equal parts I would argue more like that was [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1200.34s)]
*  a hard time to be a nurse before the vaccine. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1206.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1209.74s)]
*  Spit on screamed at misinformation. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1210.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1218.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1219.26s)]
*  But it but again if you're fired because you're not willing to get vaccinated why would you [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1220.26s)]
*  want to come back to that job if you do something else. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1224.78s)]
*  If you could find another way to make a living you like this is a thankless shitty place [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1227.3799999999999s)]
*  to work and they ultimately don't care give a fuck about you. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1231.82s)]
*  I have a friend who's a nurse and she was telling me how there's a weird coldness that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1236.02s)]
*  some people in the medical profession get because they're just accustomed to people [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1240.98s)]
*  dying. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1245.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1246.14s)]
*  That it's a normal thing and it becomes and then there's a coldness that sort of applies [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1247.14s)]
*  to firing people. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1250.74s)]
*  It applies to like there's not there's this thing where you're just accustomed to people [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1252.54s)]
*  dying. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1258.6200000000001s)]
*  I was talking to your guys about this before we started rolling like the I'm of the mind [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1259.82s)]
*  and it's wildly uninformed but it's kind of whatever anyone who goes through heavy duty [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1265.58s)]
*  combat is never the same. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1272.06s)]
*  I kind of am of the mind that like the military wrecks people. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1274.98s)]
*  Well it definitely does wreck people. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1279.42s)]
*  But some like the like a lot of them. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1281.22s)]
*  Some people are fun afterwards. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1283.78s)]
*  Everyone is psychologically wired differently and some people can handle extreme stress [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1287.06s)]
*  and with some people it's just a little bit of stress and you fall apart. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1294.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1297.7s)]
*  And I don't know if it's nature or nurture. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1298.7s)]
*  I don't know if that's genetics. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1300.66s)]
*  I mean I think it varies widely because I think some people are just innately good at [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1301.66s)]
*  pressure. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1307.1s)]
*  Yeah and resilient. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1308.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1309.1s)]
*  Very resilient. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1310.1s)]
*  What do you where would you put yourself on that? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1311.1s)]
*  Oh I don't know. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1313.3s)]
*  Because it's well not not. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1314.3s)]
*  You don't know until you're out. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1316.18s)]
*  I would say life stresses. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1317.18s)]
*  Do you handle stress well? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1319.22s)]
*  Pretty good at stress. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1320.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1321.22s)]
*  Do you find when they're when you're doing a broadcast and they go we're going live three [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1322.54s)]
*  two one are you like do you tighten up even a little bit or are you just aware? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1328.22s)]
*  I don't feel anything. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1333.38s)]
*  Like when I do the UFC I feel zero. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1334.38s)]
*  It's just fine. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1337.06s)]
*  It's like I'm here right now. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1338.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1339.9s)]
*  The only thing that I'm excited because it's cool and I want to do a good job. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1340.9s)]
*  You're wearing an IFB and they go we need you to do do do do do do do do and you just [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1344.1000000000001s)]
*  go like okay. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1347.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1348.14s)]
*  Hey man so what do you. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1349.14s)]
*  I've never like oh shit oh shit but also I've been doing it since 1997. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1350.26s)]
*  Yeah right. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1356.5400000000002s)]
*  So I've been working for the UFC since the 90s. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1357.5400000000002s)]
*  So it's like it's so normal to me. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1359.66s)]
*  Now if I just had to do it for the first time like I was talking to a friend of mine last [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1361.66s)]
*  night and we you know we're talking about doing the O2 arena you know we did this arena [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1365.66s)]
*  in London and he was like he came to see me there and he was like what was it like like [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1370.7s)]
*  performing in front of so many people. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1375.0200000000002s)]
*  It must be insane. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1376.7s)]
*  I go you get used to performing in front of lots of people and then it's normal. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1378.06s)]
*  But if it was the first time I ever went on stage and I had to go on stage in front of [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1383.3s)]
*  all those people I'd probably shit my pants. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1386.58s)]
*  I wouldn't know what to do. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1388.7s)]
*  Because it's a totally unique experience. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1390.5s)]
*  But if it's not unique if it's like you're I've done a bunch of. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1392.86s)]
*  Yeah well you just you're it's like altitude training. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1395.94s)]
*  Yeah like anything else. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1400.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think it's it's just reps putting in the reps you know. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1402.3799999999999s)]
*  And then when you do like like when I used to fight one of the things that I found was [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1406.3s)]
*  if I fought a lot I wouldn't get real nervous. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1410.26s)]
*  I would get excited but I'd feel real confident. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1413.22s)]
*  But if I had like an injury and I had to take like six months off and then I had a fight [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1416.02s)]
*  like who I haven't had that experience in a while. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1419.54s)]
*  It's like the familiarity of that experience is very important. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1422.78s)]
*  You have to be on it all the time like filming your special. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1426.1399999999999s)]
*  Could you imagine taking six months off and then just filming a special. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1429.86s)]
*  No matter how much you knew the material you'd be like fuck. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1433.82s)]
*  Even though you clearly know how to do stand up you've been doing stand up a long fucking time. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1437.3799999999999s)]
*  You've been killing a long time. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1441.46s)]
*  You know you know how to do it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1443.42s)]
*  It's not you know how to talk. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1445.02s)]
*  It's not even a special skill like you have to be physically prepared for. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1447.02s)]
*  It's not like you have to be in shape to play football. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1450.98s)]
*  It's not anything like that. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1453.3799999999999s)]
*  There is a weird shape though. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1454.58s)]
*  There is a weird conditioning. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1456.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1459.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like I'm used to it's like I used to say it's like being a lion tamer where like [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1460.38s)]
*  if you're not in the cage with lions every day. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1465.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1469.42s)]
*  After about three or four days the lions can tell. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1470.22s)]
*  They probably can. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1473.34s)]
*  I really believe they can. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1474.54s)]
*  It's like those animal trainers. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1476.42s)]
*  You see that lady that just goes like to the peacock. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1477.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1480.34s)]
*  Fucking that's how you kind of have to be with the crowd like sir. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1481.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1484.58s)]
*  And they can tell that you're comfortable. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1484.86s)]
*  In your essence. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1486.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1488.18s)]
*  But it's also like you know how to be loose and relaxed. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1489.62s)]
*  Like how much time did you take off during COVID? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1495.2199999999998s)]
*  What was the most time you took off? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1497.54s)]
*  Uh probably like with no stand up probably four or five months. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1499.1399999999999s)]
*  What was it like the first time back on stage? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1504.5s)]
*  It was kind of gleeful. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1507.54s)]
*  I know because it was they weren't the first good show was like okay but the first like [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1509.54s)]
*  you know like on it like back room was really fun and like. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1516.34s)]
*  What did you do? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1521.6999999999998s)]
*  Like what was it? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1522.26s)]
*  It was on La Cienega. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1523.54s)]
*  I think I don't remember the exact show but it was on La Cienega. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1524.74s)]
*  Mark I always forget his last name Irish guy Mark. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1527.86s)]
*  Looks like homeless Delia. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1532.1799999999998s)]
*  And he it was just like it was just some outdoors like me. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1534.98s)]
*  I think Jim Jeffries did it Ian Edwards. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1540.58s)]
*  And it was just fun because we all talked about like I don't need to do it that much [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1542.82s)]
*  and then you do it you're like this is fucking fun. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1547.06s)]
*  Yeah so you did it was outside. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1549.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah yeah yeah it was outside so it's like that's a little weird. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1551.3799999999999s)]
*  Outdoor shows are already a little weird and then. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1555.1399999999999s)]
*  How much time did it take before you did an indoor show after that? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1557.22s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1561.78s)]
*  What do you what do you what do you what's your arc with this? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1564.1799999999998s)]
*  Um I went several months uh March, April, May, June, July probably five months four or five months [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1567.46s)]
*  and um we did one weekend at the Houston improv but then I got really high and I thought oh my [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1574.58s)]
*  god what if I get COVID and give it to everybody and a bunch of people die like fuck and then so [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1581.3799999999999s)]
*  I stopped doing comedy. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1585.86s)]
*  I was because I was like okay I'm just going to go to places where you can do comedy. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1586.82s)]
*  But that was like no vaccine then no no real treatments they didn't really understand [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1591.06s)]
*  what to do if you caught it and so it was like kind of touch and go. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1595.78s)]
*  I was like maybe it's wise to not do this and wait until it actually comes because there's only like [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1600.6599999999999s)]
*  Texas and there was a few other states Florida there's few places where you can go and then I [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1605.54s)]
*  did it again in November so July and then I didn't do any stand-up again until like I guess no it's [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1610.74s)]
*  actually October then Dave and I started doing those shows at Stubbs right which is an outdoor [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1617.3799999999999s)]
*  venue where we tested everyone and we had a COVID bubble we had protocols in place and that was a [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1623.38s)]
*  lot of fun and then I did indoor shows at the Vulcan uh start from actually from today this day [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1629.5400000000002s)]
*  two years ago. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1637.46s)]
*  Huh. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1638.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1639.38s)]
*  Great. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1640.1000000000001s)]
*  And uh I did the show and I've told the story before but Ron White was like I think I'm gonna [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1640.5s)]
*  retire. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1644.98s)]
*  I heard this story. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1645.8600000000001s)]
*  He's gonna retire then he got off stage and he just grabbed me he's like whatever the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1646.98s)]
*  fuck we have to do we're gonna keep doing this. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1650.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1653.7800000000002s)]
*  It was amazing just he was like pulsating with electricity. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1654.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1658.18s)]
*  You know and so from then on we've been doing shows but the first ones back it was weird like I had to [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1658.74s)]
*  listen to recordings all day. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1665.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1667.6200000000001s)]
*  And I went over my notes and I had to like think about transitions and you have to like revive. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1668.02s)]
*  Fortunately I was in a similar boat to you where I was kind of ready to film a special [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1674.26s)]
*  right when everything shut down so I had a lot of material that was pretty tight. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1679.7s)]
*  It wasn't like it was all new stuff like if I had to just do like I've already released a special [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1683.54s)]
*  and then COVID came along and then I hadn't done stand up in six months and then I'm doing like new [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1688.5s)]
*  stuff. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1693.54s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1694.18s)]
*  Oh I'd be fucked. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1694.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1695.54s)]
*  Because you don't have anything. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1695.8600000000001s)]
*  Did you have you film had you haven't filmed in a while right? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1696.98s)]
*  Filmed in August. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1700.02s)]
*  Is it out yet? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1701.22s)]
*  I haven't done anything with it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1701.7s)]
*  No I haven't even looked at it. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1702.5800000000002s)]
*  Why not? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1704.5800000000002s)]
*  Because I didn't feel like it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1705.22s)]
*  Feel like filming it went great. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1706.58s)]
*  I said okay good got in the can. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1708.58s)]
*  I think I'm going to release it right around the time my club opens and so my club will be open [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1710.9s)]
*  somewhere around February March. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1716.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1719.62s)]
*  So that's what I'm probably going to do. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1720.26s)]
*  And uh do you got a plan for a streamer? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1722.02s)]
*  I haven't decided yet you know I'm very fortunate that I could do whatever the fuck I want to do. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1725.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1730.1s)]
*  So I'm trying to figure out what I want to do. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1730.5s)]
*  I might just fucking throw it on YouTube. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1732.66s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1735.54s)]
*  There seems to be no you know a mutual friend of ours named Dave Chappelle used to say [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1736.82s)]
*  good pussy doesn't need a pimp good pussy sells itself. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1745.3s)]
*  That's true. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1752.5s)]
*  But uh like Ari Schubert he's at I think he's close to 2.5 million now [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1754.02s)]
*  and he's just been up for a few days. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1759.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1761.3s)]
*  Way bigger than any response he would have ever gotten if it was on Netflix. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1761.86s)]
*  It was on Netflix his last special was on Netflix for the longest time and he's like [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1765.38s)]
*  I don't think it ever got to a million. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1769.8600000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1772.5s)]
*  Yeah and yeah it's hard man what's he at 2.4 2 million 420 thousand. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1772.9s)]
*  I haven't watched it I was very impressed with the production design. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1778.66s)]
*  It's great. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1782.3400000000001s)]
*  Like that's like oh that's fucking looks really cool. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1783.0600000000002s)]
*  Well Ari was working on that for a long time and then the Kobe thing. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1785.7s)]
*  I didn't know he was Jewish. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1790.18s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1791.14s)]
*  Ah and he abandoned it he was actually gonna film like very close to when that Kobe thing [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1792.0400000000002s)]
*  happened and then uh he sort of put it aside and started doing stand-up again and wrote a whole [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1798.1200000000001s)]
*  new act and then you know I talked to him and I was like dude why you gotta put that out. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1805.0800000000002s)]
*  Like it was so good because he had it so tight. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1812.2s)]
*  And it was it's cool because it's kind of evergreen right it's not it's just I grew up [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1814.8400000000001s)]
*  orthodox and it was fucking weird. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1819.8s)]
*  Yeah and it's it's better now because it's like he's like as time goes on the more you can [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1821.96s)]
*  sort of sit with a subject that's very personal to you and then you know sometimes it's good to [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1829.1599999999999s)]
*  just put it aside and not even look at it for a while. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1835.24s)]
*  That's kind of what happened with my show. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1837.56s)]
*  I did it in New York for four or five months four months every night. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1840.12s)]
*  It's like a one man show. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1844.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1846.36s)]
*  Now when you do that do you have a guy warming up the crowd or you just go out there cold? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1846.84s)]
*  In fact no you go out there cold which is interesting because [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1851.08s)]
*  your first joke's either gonna work or it isn't. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1859.48s)]
*  So like you could sometimes they're primed but I would say the first joke worked 80% of the time [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1865.16s)]
*  but sometimes you'd be like okay like you'd throw a punch and like they just stand there [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1870.6s)]
*  and you're like. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1874.76s)]
*  But there's some you know Cosby doesn't have an opener. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1877.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1880.52s)]
*  Like there's a way to do it where there's something about it I don't there's something appealing [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1881.0s)]
*  about it where where if you don't have an opener you just go like yeah the first two [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1887.32s)]
*  minutes will be a little bumpy but like whatever. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1891.64s)]
*  Yeah did you ever see Richard Pryor live the one he filmed in Long Beach? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1894.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1899.4s)]
*  Where he goes on stage and people are still sitting down. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1902.92s)]
*  They're walking through the crowd sitting down he's talking shit to them while they're [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1903.32s)]
*  walking and talking a guy comes up and takes a photo at like stands by the stage and takes [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1906.9199999999998s)]
*  a photo. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1912.6s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1912.84s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1913.8s)]
*  It's fucking hilarious. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1914.84s)]
*  I don't think he had an opener. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1916.36s)]
*  I did warm up for myself at the Netflix taping. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1917.48s)]

*  Really so you did different material to warm up. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1924.12s)]
*  Eight minutes I did like eight minutes and then just like hey just touching base. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1926.9199999999998s)]

*  There's fucking talk shows when they have the applause and then there's a guy that's [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1945.24s)]

*  They didn't seem excited to see me. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1963.96s)]
*  I did my own warm up that was helpful. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1967.16s)]
*  Second taping I didn't have time. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1968.76s)]
*  So second taping was 20% worse than the first taping. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1971.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1975.64s)]
*  Yeah I was and it was one of these things where I'm doing the show and I'm like fuck [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1976.1200000000001s)]

*  And it was like the load in took too long and I was like fuck. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1985.0s)]
*  But by the end of it the last half was better than the first show's last half. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1989.8799999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=1995.8799999999999s)]

*  in the production just because I can direct and I can do a bunch of stuff and I've done [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2013.48s)]

*  Hulu that's a magic show. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2021.48s)]
*  I don't like to call it a magic show. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2023.0800000000002s)]
*  One of the best taped live shows you'll ever see. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2024.52s)]
*  What? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2029.0800000000002s)]

*  It's fucking excellent. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2030.68s)]
*  But he is directing he's only directed his specials so he's like I'm it's a lot of moving [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2033.64s)]
*  parts like they didn't have a lav mic for me. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2042.3600000000001s)]
*  They had a handheld and I'm like I'm wearing a lav and it's four and the audience is getting [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2046.8400000000001s)]
*  there we got to tape at 5 30. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2052.6800000000003s)]

*  the end roll credits if you get to give them all a grade. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2070.6s)]
*  Like sound B minus didn't love the lav move didn't love the dude. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2074.52s)]
*  It was just poor communication or just yeah it's just one of those things where like there's [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2080.7599999999998s)]
*  a lot of cracks just shit can fall through you know being in charge of a thing and doing [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2087.32s)]
*  arena shows and doing people fuck up. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2093.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2097.56s)]
*  Just by nature like you know I remember [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2098.44s)]
*  Schumer thought it was sexism rock thought it was racism when they started directing stuff [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2101.64s)]
*  and people were fucking up they thought this is about my identity this is they don't respect [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2108.76s)]
*  me. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2115.0s)]
*  I kind of am paranoid enough to be like they're fucking haters and did it like you can I can [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2116.12s)]
*  easily lapse into that and it's just people human error. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2121.32s)]
*  Incompetence there's a lot of that. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2126.92s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2129.88s)]
*  30 percent I have a theory 30 percent of things just get fucked up. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2130.84s)]
*  30. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2137.7999999999997s)]
*  30 if I say hey I need X 30 percent of the time people don't hear you they misinterpret [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2138.36s)]
*  they go I have a better idea. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2147.96s)]
*  But like straightforward stuff like if you're doing a theater and there's a sound guy works [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2149.72s)]
*  for the theater it's almost 100 percent works almost 100 percent of the time that guy knows [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2154.36s)]
*  what he's doing you get in there. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2159.4s)]

*  So I'm like play Kendrick Lamar give him the song give him the time 10 seconds in [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2184.76s)]

*  Oh no. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2256.52s)]
*  The good news is if you're if I'm talking and there's a thump underneath me you're not [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2258.6s)]
*  gonna hear it meaning like right but when I pause so we had to go through the sound and take out [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2264.36s)]
*  every thump kind of by hand. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2269.56s)]
*  For how many minutes left in your set? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2274.2799999999997s)]
*  In the set 15. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2276.52s)]
*  Oh god. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2279.0s)]

*  and that's the kind of thing where it's like where you go yeah no I don't again maybe it's [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2287.56s)]
*  just my luck maybe it's just like I just have bad luck with shit like that but [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2292.52s)]
*  you know at a certain like it just shit fucks up the sound the music or the lighting cue or the [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2296.68s)]
*  a woman you know they just you it's like I do that and you can rehearse it I rehearsed it five times. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2307.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2312.2s)]
*  So your thing that you did the way you did it with this one man show what was the motivation [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2313.96s)]
*  behind this like why did you decide to do a special that's not necessary it's stand up but [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2320.04s)]
*  it's not necessarily really stand up you have like you have a presentation. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2325.08s)]
*  Yeah the this one has this one's called Blocks the new one on Netflix well take the the three [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2329.24s)]
*  mics one I did the Comedy Central special 10 years ago I thought it was good you know good [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2337.08s)]
*  jokes whatever people didn't really like you like 10 years ago though Comedy Central was already in [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  this weird spot where people weren't listening as much. Yeah I agree with that the ratings were [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2349.8s)]
*  surprisingly good it was just one of these things like I didn't become a big club act I didn't it [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2355.32s)]
*  was just I didn't have like I'm now a devotee it was kind of like oh that guy's kind of funny. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2360.28s)]
*  Yeah but I think everybody got that from Comedy Central specials like you had to be like Kevin [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2368.1200000000003s)]
*  Hart like there's only a few guys who did Netflix or excuse me Comedy Central specials and just took [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2371.8s)]
*  off after 2000 you know it was like later like when you get to 2012-2014 now you're dealing with [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2377.16s)]
*  streaming services you're dealing with other things and you just don't have as many people [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2386.92s)]
*  watching and it's also you got commercials which is the death of comedy you're doing these seven [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2392.44s)]
*  minute chunks. Netflix has commercials now Joe. Isn't that wild? Yeah I know I wonder I'm like I want to [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2398.2s)]
*  watch it I wonder because it's not they don't even say where do you want us to put the commercial. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2404.92s)]
*  But are the commercials before shows or during shows? I don't I have no it's new so I have no [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2409.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it's during because if they're after ain't nobody watching it. If they do it during shows I [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2414.6800000000003s)]
*  will be very upset. I've heard that Shonda Rhimes and some of the people that have shows on there [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2421.0s)]
*  are like a little bit pissed about that they it's like part of the reason they went to Netflix is [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2426.6000000000004s)]
*  because they wanted the just shit to play the way they want to play which I guess. They lost a shit [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=2432.92s)]

*  that happens with people when they get locked up in a controversy is that they start dwelling on [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3251.96s)]
*  all these different opinions on them and they start taking it in and considering it and wanting [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3259.48s)]
*  to argue it I never said it that way that's not what I meant you motherfuckers and then it becomes [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3264.6800000000003s)]

*  are it's Adam saying like big attention a lot of positive attention pointed at you and you must [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3471.64s)]
*  at a certain point go I have to make a very firm decision about this yeah well Dave doesn't have [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3481.16s)]
*  social media on his phone at all I but I but at the same time he gets sent every he sees everything [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3487.32s)]
*  he can people send him important things with things that people think are important [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3493.7999999999997s)]
*  I tell people never send me anything about me well that's somebody sent me a review and I [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3498.68s)]
*  my public I was like don't send me this literally don't send me I don't want to read it [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3502.68s)]
*  people are entitled to their opinion and they should express their opinion there's nothing wrong [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3506.7599999999998s)]
*  I agree with that I say yeah you should participate in their opinion when you don't even know these [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3511.4799999999996s)]
*  people and you should take this in and in some people treated like gospel like some people's [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3516.2s)]
*  confidence has been destroyed yeah by someone telling them they suck I mean it really can [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3521.48s)]
*  fuck with some people's heads it was fucking up my Miami my Hawaii trip well one of the things [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3526.04s)]
*  that I do that I think is very important is I work out really hard and I think that resets my day [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3531.48s)]
*  every time so all the other things like oh I should read the comments like what what are they [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3538.44s)]
*  saying then none of that happened there's no room for that I'm so exhausted from that like [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3543.64s)]
*  you almost kill yourself it's a weird like near-death experience so I get to a point [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3550.2799999999997s)]
*  where I've wrung all the stress out of my body yeah and when I do that then other stuff doesn't [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3555.7999999999997s)]
*  seem like it's a big deal it really is it's like the physical discomfort yeah you reset your [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3563.48s)]
*  hierarchy of needs you it's uh it's yeah it's like I did a I wrote a joke with Blake Griffin [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3570.6s)]
*  the basketball player one time where I was like they're asking guys they're interviewing guys [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3578.6s)]
*  after they've just actually they they're trying not to they're getting they're trying to get [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3583.4s)]
*  oxygen to their brain right like it's a bad time to do an interview well I was doing interviews [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3588.2799999999997s)]
*  with people after they got knocked unconscious and and do you feel are you kind of like ah I do you [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3594.2799999999997s)]
*  not like it it's not a good time to interview people they make mistakes because like you just [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3600.92s)]
*  had your brain shut off like maybe they think they want to fight or maybe they think something [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3606.12s)]
*  they don't know what the fuck just happened and there's varying degrees of that like you can [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3610.7599999999998s)]
*  pretend oh he knows he's playing dumb but you have zero idea what's going on in a person's brain [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3615.16s)]
*  unless you are them and you have been knocked out did they have a policy of like not doing that [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3620.7599999999998s)]
*  anymore or you said I won't do it and then I fucked up and did it with Daniel Cormier but I [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3625.7999999999997s)]
*  was so confused in that fight because Daniel's a good friend I love him to death and John Jones had [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3631.48s)]
*  just knocked him out and I was in this state this is not is this recent or no no this was a few years [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3640.28s)]
*  back yeah I haven't done any like knockouts interviews since but I think I did a couple of [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3645.56s)]
*  TKOs and I think it's a judgment call like there's sometimes when the guy's getting fucked up but [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3652.84s)]
*  it's really like he's just beaten he's getting his legs kicked and punched the referee comes and [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3659.32s)]
*  stops the fight but he's okay like he's he just got fucked up he's not out cold but sometimes [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3664.04s)]
*  guys get knocked out cold and when they get knocked out cold like oh you're you you don't really know [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3670.6000000000004s)]
*  because they went away yeah and then they come back yeah and it's they're in an arena some for [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3676.6800000000003s)]
*  some reason yeah some guys are fine and they handle it with grace and dignity and you know [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3681.0800000000004s)]
*  they're amazing at it and that's also depending upon that knockout versus a different knockout [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3686.52s)]
*  like what happened to you that day like how bad did you get beat up before you got knocked out was [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3692.04s)]
*  it just one punch was it a kick to the head is a kick to head worse than a punch to the head [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3696.92s)]
*  even though both knock you out the force of a kick is way higher so you don't really know you don't [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3701.48s)]
*  really know until you're talking to them and I don't think you really will ever know because a [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3707.4s)]
*  lot of people can talk on autopilot and then they'll tell you like they go back remember talking [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3712.52s)]
*  to you yeah they go back to the dressing room they have no idea they fought and then they're [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3717.4s)]
*  in the hospital room afterwards they don't know what happened and they lose like hours of the night [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3721.08s)]
*  it's really common yeah so the task them but I think you're smart to get back to the original [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3726.44s)]
*  thing you're smart to reset your hierarchy yeah where you're fucking exhausted and you want to [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3732.36s)]
*  just breathe and get your body back to like a reg and you still have all that like exercise drain [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3740.52s)]
*  slash tingle there's that too there's like you you exhaust yourself which I think is very good for [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3747.08s)]
*  you my brother Kevin used to use you of the stress used to jog every day to run the Brennan out of [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3752.44s)]
*  them like we got bad shit in us I have to run it out of me that's hilarious it's fucking very funny [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3758.68s)]
*  and hey and but that that's a smart approach there's so there's two things going on there's [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3768.44s)]
*  the physical thing where you're wringing out the stress which I think is very real it makes you [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3775.56s)]
*  feel better and it's easier to get by but then there's also the psychological thing because to [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3779.8s)]
*  work out really hard is very difficult to do and you think things are difficult until you compare [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3786.04s)]
*  them to things that are very difficult like very difficult things like if you have if say if you're [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3791.48s)]
*  going on a hike in the mountains and you're going to backpack in and camp out and it's 14 miles in [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3797.96s)]

*  fucking hard yeah when you're 9 000 feet above sea level you're like yeah that's real hard [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3820.2s)]
*  it's not comments on fucking twitter yeah that's not really hard yeah that is easy to ignore it's [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3827.7999999999997s)]
*  easy like you have the option to ignore it and life goes on or you can't even your brain's like yo I [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3833.08s)]
*  can't worry about like you could you'll have a flash of it yeah I mean like I can't we can't [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3838.4399999999996s)]
*  fuck it dude you're gonna you gotta breathe and you gotta get that you're you're gonna perish [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3842.3599999999997s)]
*  yeah but you also got to do difficult shit you do difficult shit to change what your water mark is [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=3846.76s)]

*  development that human beings go through unless you're you're there for it let's maybe have a [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5021.96s)]
*  younger brother or sister and you get to see them grow up in in front of your eyes when you're already [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5025.96s)]
*  yeah that's the thing i almost think one of the reasons i don't want kids is because i never [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5030.12s)]
*  had a younger brother sister to like watch right you know what i mean well i have a younger sister [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5034.76s)]
*  but she's only one year younger so we basically grew up got it but i think that uh that does [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5041.4s)]
*  aid in people's decision making like if you're a sister and you're you know you're the oldest [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5046.76s)]
*  sister and you have to babysit the younger one and you really like it and you like taking care of [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5052.28s)]
*  well that's a good sign yeah maybe you should have kids but when you're watching your own kids grow [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5056.839999999999s)]
*  and develop it's like very eye-opening it's it just makes you really take into account [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5062.839999999999s)]
*  all the various factors that are involved in making a human being and and and developing a [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5069.48s)]
*  well-rounded healthy human being and and is it where are you on nature nurture is it do you see [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5075.5599999999995s)]
*  them at work do you see them come to a fork in existence and like make a decision you're like [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5083.64s)]
*  wow if they'd gone that if they and and by the way it's not even a decision it's just an inclination [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5092.04s)]
*  well i think you want your children to be able to make decisions for themselves but it's like how [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5098.68s)]
*  many and how far like at what point do you feel like you know you need to impose some guidance [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5104.04s)]
*  or some discipline if they do something fucked up like if they break into your liquor cabinet [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5112.76s)]
*  steal all your booze and their 13 year old buddies are blacked out on the floor like hey we got a [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5117.88s)]

*  and i think one of the most important things is having conversations with them like they're [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5152.2s)]
*  regular people that's not hard to do like you just talk to them like they're a regular person [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5155.719999999999s)]
*  and instead of trying to talk to them like a little kid i mean i'm very loving but i'll [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5161.88s)]
*  oftentimes have conversations with them i'll try to explain things like the way i could explain to [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5168.2s)]
*  an adult and i try to get them to explain things to me you know in a sort of a very expressive way [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5173.88s)]
*  and do you wild man i will know it sounds like a weirdly surreal experience it's very surreal it's [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5181.16s)]

*  in history in his field this is like these are like very prominent physicians and doctors and [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5353.24s)]
*  so saying they're they're misinformation you're buying into the bullshit and you're you're upset [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5361.0s)]

*  telling you is not true and what they're telling you about this being misinformation if you have [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5377.08s)]
*  someone on who wants to go into in-depth discussion about whether or not this is a gain of function [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5381.5599999999995s)]
*  research lab virus that got accidentally released onto the world there's a lot of evidence points [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5386.28s)]
*  to that right but that shit would get you removed from youtube just a year and a half ago they would [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5392.12s)]
*  they would pull you yeah from online you wouldn't be able to say that but that's pretty much accepted [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5396.92s)]
*  there's like a 90 something percent certainty when the i think the last time they polled the [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5402.68s)]
*  man is there a poll like how many let's let's find out if this is true because i think i've [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5408.28s)]
*  read this on reddit what percentage of people believe the lab leak hypothesis is the origin of [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5412.68s)]
*  covet like if the almost in that like prominent scientists like scientists because i've heard [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5420.52s)]
*  people argue against it that they think it's a natural spillover but the arguments against [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5425.72s)]
*  that argument are very compelling saying there's no animal model that doesn't make any sense and [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5430.84s)]
*  also it's in the same fucking place where they had a covet lab like it's right there this is where [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5435.56s)]
*  it started from when john stewart was on colbert and he went on that ramp that's funny oh my god [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5441.32s)]
*  it was funny as fuck because steven was frozen trying to cock block it yeah even trying to [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5446.4400000000005s)]
*  know you don't mean that some evidence yeah if you have any evidence i'd like to see the evidence [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5451.400000000001s)]
*  like what are you saying man why are you holding water for a chinese bio lab [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5455.88s)]
*  politico harvard poll most americans bleed covet leak from a lab this is a year and a half ago though [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5461.799999999999s)]
*  just now it's probably everybody okay okay so that's one poll i think there was like a poll [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5467.08s)]
*  among scientists i think i think what i read was like in a conversation it's one of those weird [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5475.48s)]
*  things where i don't care where it's from and it just becomes an argument about like oh i fucking [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5480.92s)]
*  care you do how come because there's funding behind that where the american taxpayers like [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5485.72s)]
*  helped fund this kind of research oh this is research that obama shut down right and then [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5491.4800000000005s)]
*  during the trump administration they're like fucking started back up again baby yeah and uh [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5497.96s)]
*  people have been very deceptive about whether or not this research has ever even done you know [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5505.400000000001s)]
*  that's the famous do you think it's paul you've seen those ran paul fauci conversations where [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5509.72s)]
*  he's calling it gain of function research and and fauci is like sticking to this very very narrow [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5515.240000000001s)]
*  definition of what gain of function is but the reality is they manipulated viruses and made them [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5522.4400000000005s)]
*  more contagious for humans right that's what they did in that lab that is all that's also an ongoing [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5528.280000000001s)]
*  thing in science like it's like it's kind of part of science it's not like yeah it's not some like [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5534.6s)]
*  secret fucking nefarious lab it's just a thing that people do in science well they they give money [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5540.68s)]
*  to different labs for different research projects and right when fauci is leaving he's retiring [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5548.04s)]
*  he just gave uh another grant to the same people that they were accusing of doing this work so so [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5554.76s)]
*  that's your like that's your sort of premise on why it why because i i'm still in the mind of [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5561.48s)]
*  like okay even when you say because people gave money to it is it just about like don't don't pay [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5569.24s)]
*  these people is about stopping that process there should be some some real conversations about why [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5574.28s)]
*  this was done like why are you doing that work like are you doing that work so that you can come up [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5581.799999999999s)]
*  with better cures and where are those cures because like what what are you or are you just [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5587.24s)]
*  doing the work to better understand viruses so you're risking making this highly contagious [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5591.639999999999s)]
*  virus that may or may not get out just because you have research money they're doing in tons of [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5597.5599999999995s)]
*  areas though right like that am i misunderstanding that they do it oh yeah yeah they do it in galveston [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5602.12s)]
*  we went dunkin and i went to the galveston lab and it's fucking crazy dude they're all got [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5607.16s)]
*  spacesuits on and vacuums attached to their heads and shit and they're working and and the guy was [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5611.4s)]
*  explaining to us because we are working with some of the most infectious horrific diseases in the [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5615.64s)]
*  world they're right here we're like what the fuck y'all should stop but he was saying that they [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5620.68s)]
*  weren't worried about man-made stuff he was saying that our biggest fear is some natural spillover [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5625.8s)]
*  that's catastrophic something like the plague or and that that is really possible and that's why [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5631.08s)]
*  they have to study these diseases it was a really wild thing because he wasn't worried at all about [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5637.72s)]
*  what actually happened at the time because this was like i think when dunkin and i was like what [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5642.68s)]
*  was that like 2013 or something um so it was quite a while ago and um i don't think they were really [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5648.280000000001s)]
*  worried about an engineered virus you know something that was uh naturally designed to become more [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5655.96s)]
*  infectious so they could study how those things work is there in terms of like information [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5662.52s)]
*  and misinformation ai deep face all that whole field [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5669.88s)]
*  where and even what elon musk running twitter now right where do you fall on because i i'm [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5679.0s)]

*  for life a better term board jury some system in place for what is true and what is not true [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5693.48s)]
*  i and the and when i talk these things out with people i always end up in like we all agree that [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5702.839999999999s)]
*  there needs to be some board we can't agree on who should be on the board how would you fucking do [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5708.919999999999s)]

*  everyone says is true i think a better better solution is mind reading and i think we're [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5733.4s)]
*  probably way closer to that i think they're gonna hear me out they're gonna come out with that [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5740.2s)]
*  neural link thing and along with it as it improves any and there's a bunch of different human neural [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5746.2s)]
*  interface computer things are working on different companies i love shit like that that's a bridge [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5752.599999999999s)]

*  think it's going to be one of those things where the benefit of having it is going to be so huge [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5762.5199999999995s)]
*  and it's going to really fuck with this whole haves and have nots thing because the people [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5766.92s)]
*  that get access to it quicker in the beginning if it really does increase what do you see this [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5771.32s)]
*  machine doing what the way elon describes it is increasing the bandwidth in which you can access [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5776.679999999999s)]

*  human evolution and you're left behind you're cool with that oh i know what you mean i might be what [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5804.52s)]

*  have did you read the one that's like joke based there's a joke based ai no [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5891.48s)]
*  oh joe it's not bad it's not funny yet but it's like you can see how it could be [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5896.52s)]
*  so i think it will be like bodybuilding where there's clean competitions [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5909.64s)]
*  and assisted competitions or like yeah but of course a bot's funnier than me [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5918.68s)]
*  me right like it it you know what i mean like it's going to get to the point where there's [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5924.6s)]
*  if there's an art thing the one that won the competition it's a fucking really nice [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5930.52s)]
*  painting or whatever the fuck you call it really nice creation yeah but it's not even [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5935.56s)]
*  it's it's like to say it's wrong it's not you can't have it competing against humans [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5942.200000000001s)]
*  no so that's i think what you're saying is like well what do we do i think they'll just be like [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5949.240000000001s)]
*  divisions where the problem is though if that's what human beings are going to become [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5953.56s)]
*  ultimately we seem to be totally relying on technology everybody accepts everyone has a [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5960.52s)]
*  phone everyone has email yeah everyone has a computer you know when they first came out the [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5965.56s)]
*  personal computer there are so many people that were saying this is the dumbest idea ever who the [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5969.4800000000005s)]
*  fuck is going to want a computer in their house now everyone has a computer if all of this [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5974.120000000001s)]
*  becomes integrated into the human body we the way our level of acceptance of it right now is 100 [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5980.2s)]
*  and it's not weird by in any world well that's the funny how insidious it is where it's not [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5986.679999999999s)]
*  it's it's slow it's slow moving but it's it's it's basically in your body yeah yeah basically [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=5994.12s)]
*  yeah it's even if it's not bluetooth it's an appendage yeah at this point that we welcome [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6001.08s)]
*  and by the way it didn't happen overnight although i remember having like a sidekick [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6007.0s)]
*  in oh three and being like pretty hooked on it yeah like pretty quickly like oh this is very [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6011.64s)]

*  what are we talking about fucking for you that click fucking you were king of the world yeah if [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6023.24s)]
*  you were cool you uh that was like when paris hilton was in full bloom couldn't tell me she had a [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6027.48s)]
*  sidekick yeah you god damn right she did uh but the the question is [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6031.8s)]
*  if you this is severed or uh discussion but it's almost like the if you took a you know when they [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6039.8s)]
*  do the is america on the right track and they vote like yes or no or is this the kind if you [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6044.92s)]
*  ask most humans is earth on the right track they'd be like nah i don't think this is good [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6051.0s)]

*  beyond this point i think once they invent them it's it's over i think everyone's gonna adopt it [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6079.96s)]
*  the same way we adopted shoes i think it's people are gonna realize that having some sort of a [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6085.64s)]
*  computer interface that's far superior in so many ways to your human memory to human memory yeah [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6091.88s)]
*  what if you could offload your visual memory to like hd video that was like an episode of the dark [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6099.0s)]
*  mirror wasn't it yeah yeah that's not outside the realm of possibility if they do start installing [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6107.64s)]
*  chips in people's brains we will have like a super accurate recording of everything you do [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6114.76s)]
*  everything you've done yeah and if at any point in time someone accuses you something well [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6123.320000000001s)]
*  yeah there's no more opinion there's no that's the problem with china you go to china they scan your [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6127.88s)]
*  face they're tracking you the whole time i was thinking like i couldn't do drugs i couldn't go [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6133.0s)]
*  if i go somewhere to do something fucked up and i'm chinese i it's that you cannot be a dissident [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6139.64s)]
*  after that point because they go what are you doing we have video we have cameras there's a [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6148.280000000001s)]
*  hundred million cameras in china we're watching you through your eyes well that's where that's [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6154.4400000000005s)]
*  where that's where we're going that's what i'm saying what i'm saying is they won't have to [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6160.68s)]
*  wonder or not whether or not you committed a crime they'll be able to literally watch you do it [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6165.24s)]
*  right when then they will also be able to prevent you from doing it yeah and if you get to a point [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6169.48s)]
*  where we are all online together like our minds are connected who's running the server well this [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6175.72s)]
*  is i told santino this the other day it's i've pitched it on here before pres pres bot robot [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6183.4s)]
*  president ai president put all the information of human history into an ai all human psychology [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6189.08s)]
*  outcomes and it would be the competition of well what are we doing howard zin's history of [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6199.72s)]
*  america are we doing the textbook history of america we're doing critical race theory we're [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6204.12s)]
*  doing whatever all of the that's where the fight would be but that to me is getting to the point [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6207.88s)]
*  of like there's a lot of fucking human error and it's a lot of dumb he's tall shit that could be [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6213.72s)]
*  prevented by some form of art i mean i guess it's artificial but but i don't know and what do you [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6221.96s)]
*  think like a robot president would do about ukraine i think it would i think [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6229.96s)]
*  again it's my own liberal slant so it's like i think he would support it with a cutoff date [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6238.6s)]
*  oh jesus and then what happens at the cutoff day you leave him alone and russia just comes [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6243.64s)]
*  storming in or you just super you yeah yeah i don't know afghanistan yeah afghanistan what do [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6247.8s)]
*  you think they should have i mean afghanistan should have been a policeman it's the the thing [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6255.56s)]
*  that was said robot president would have never got us into either one of those robot president [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6258.68s)]
*  totally would have done the calculations and said this is not going to end well like look we've [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6263.72s)]
*  actually thought this out we planned it out but robot president do you think robot president would [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6267.72s)]
*  have gamed out ukraine and come to the like gone like no they can fight them [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6273.0s)]
*  yeah they can fight them and if they have international support [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6282.28s)]
*  because even if you game out ukraine all right so let's let russia take it [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6286.12s)]
*  i don't think that's positive i don't think robot i don't even think robot president would like that [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6291.08s)]
*  like robot president would say we have to risk some lives to save the territory [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6296.76s)]
*  yeah because the spread of of ideology government it's not good to just have like g7 fucking [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6302.28s)]
*  governments in taking just land willy-nilly and then the argument that putin had was that nato [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6310.919999999999s)]
*  kept encroaching on its borders they were trying to get ukraine to join nato and you know that [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6318.28s)]
*  would have like too many consequences for him yeah i don't which seems like that's [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6323.88s)]
*  struck me as a fake argument struck me as a it was a good it was a bit of the saddam hussein thing [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6330.68s)]
*  where it was like uh do you have yellow you have nuclear you have nukes and all that stuff [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6337.56s)]
*  and i think hussein's point was like i don't want my neighbors to know what i have [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6344.4400000000005s)]
*  so if it's all the same to you guys i'd like to keep it a little mysterious [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6350.28s)]
*  as to what i have and not make it i yeah i'm not crazy about inspectors so i think with putin it [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6357.24s)]
*  was like he didn't he said i don't think i don't but i don't buy the fact that nato was going to [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6364.2s)]
*  invade russia i don't think that was a real threat no one was ever saying nato was going to invade [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6370.36s)]
*  russia what they were saying was that by them moving their missiles closer to russia it made [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6375.16s)]
*  like an initial first attack much more convenient and it also violated the treaty that they signed [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6382.5199999999995s)]
*  what was it there was uh what was the agreement that they had it was like there was there was an [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6388.6s)]
*  agreement somewhere around i want to say 94 or something like that where they discussed making [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6395.56s)]
*  sure that um well what's funny is the counter couldn't get their miss i forget the ukraine made [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6405.160000000001s)]
*  a deal with russia will give up our nukes as long as you never invade us so it's like which if i'm [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6413.0s)]
*  the robot i'm like hey there's contradictory information here do you know what i mean like [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=6418.84s)]

*  whether it not whether that's misinformation holocaust denial right just as like a thing [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7391.320000000001s)]
*  because this is the thing that zuckerberg said if somebody posted holocaust denial on facebook he [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7395.96s)]
*  accepted and then a couple years later he was like you know i've had a change of heart i think i [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7401.96s)]
*  would try to get rid of it do we do a free-for-all and and if that leads to the demise of humanity [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7407.240000000001s)]
*  so be it or do we have some mechanism because that's the that seems to be the argument whenever [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7415.8s)]
*  because people go i don't think i think alex jones should be able to say whatever he wants i think [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7425.56s)]
*  whoever can say whatever they want and then they and and we have to let the chips fall where they [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7430.12s)]
*  may because i don't trust any human being to be in charge of this so we just have to see where [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7435.799999999999s)]
*  this takes us because the the there was a thing in in with whatsapp for example uh owned by meta [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7442.84s)]
*  mark zuckerberg and there was a thing there's a lot of misinformation on whatsapp they'll just [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7451.08s)]
*  blast people they'll just blast numbers and in the miyanmar civil war there was a thing if you [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7456.52s)]
*  look this up it'd be great because there was a thing where they blasted misinformation and it a [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7464.4400000000005s)]
*  bunch of people went to some location and were slaughtered it was like a it was a setup basically [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7470.4400000000005s)]
*  now a free speech absolutist would say a genocide incited on facebook with posts from miyanmar's [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7478.120000000001s)]

*  military personnel who turned the social network into a tool for ethnic cleansing [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7512.28s)]

*  problem with that's another problem with social media is that there's a very distinct real number [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7523.24s)]
*  with whatever the number is where those accounts aren't real so whatever the number is they for [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7529.5599999999995s)]

*  freedom's messy the question is that you read more of that people got [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7564.6s)]
*  fucking thousands of people maybe tens of thousands yeah based on fake posts yeah but so what i'm [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7571.400000000001s)]
*  saying is like there's all sorts of ways people manipulate social media the fact that you could [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7577.08s)]
*  just communicate to people like instantaneously it's really magical pretty amazing but the problem [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7584.6s)]
*  that comes along with that is that you're you're going to get people manipulating it and they're [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7591.72s)]
*  going to you're going to get people that could really have a great deal of impact on the way [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7596.280000000001s)]
*  people see and think about things and you could do that for your own best interest or you could [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7601.08s)]
*  do that like they did it and slaughter a bunch of people you could do that to try to make people [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7606.76s)]
*  aware of a situation to sell a product to do it but the the bottom line is the elections were [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7613.400000000001s)]

*  percent or some crazy people think it might be as high as 80 percent what was that argument that [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7675.08s)]
*  was by a guy who was some sort of securities expert correct and he said like the on the high end he [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=7681.5599999999995s)]

*  why do you have gates if someone could just open the gate and a cop opens the gate right right because [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8838.92s)]
*  they're under armed they're the the the the insurgents are over armed uh and the cops are [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8843.08s)]
*  they won't send back up they couldn't have them didn't have good equipment yeah haven't allowed [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8851.32s)]

*  to avoid that how i interpreted it now i don't know this pretty here's but this reminds me of something [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8864.68s)]
*  it's the steve bannon thing of flooding the zone with shit what they so i see it as one conspiracy [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8871.48s)]
*  and then they all run up there and whatever i have an alternate viewpoint i think a lot of cops might [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8879.8s)]
*  be on their side i that of course right so a lot of those guys might be like fuck yeah i'm gonna [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8885.8s)]

*  i don't even know what to think anymore when in reality we kind of know what happened what [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8909.64s)]
*  percentage of voting do you think is fraud what percentage of the results because it's not zero [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8915.96s)]
*  so what's the number so i i don't know i mean they all this did what the guy said the last election [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8924.279999999999s)]

*  any election results that's not what i'm trying to do what i'm trying to say is for sure they lie [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8936.44s)]
*  about everything people lie and steal and manipulate and if you get 50 fucking states filled with people [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8942.2s)]
*  that are doing there's got to be someone working there with a trump sucks cox tattoo and he's [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8950.2s)]
*  probably handling balance constant supervision right so there's there's a number so do you think [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8955.16s)]
*  it's like a negligible number do you think like how much voter fraud is there i'm over the mind [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8961.16s)]
*  that it's negligible in that every time i read again i'm reading so who but i don't right but i [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8965.8s)]
*  i've never been in an election where people are like i didn't fucking vote for i've never been [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8974.039999999999s)]
*  compelled to think that election was rigged i've always like questioned it i remember that hbo [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8977.96s)]
*  documentary hacking democracy where they took these um i think they were diebold make sure that's true [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8983.48s)]
*  i think they were diebold computers and they found out that there was a third party uh ability to [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8990.199999999999s)]
*  enter third party data that they could utilize and they could affect the outcome so they ran a [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8995.08s)]
*  study or they ran a test with this machine where they uh manipulated it and they got different [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=8999.8s)]
*  results than they should have gotten they got results where it favored the client that this [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9004.76s)]
*  this one that this program was set up probably the incumbent yeah diebold in leon county florida so [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9009.32s)]
*  it was a really wild documentary because you realize like this can be a hundred percent can [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9015.96s)]
*  be manipulated yeah and and it's actually designed to be manipulated there was a thing on 60 minutes [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9019.72s)]
*  a couple weeks ago so it's 60 minutes so it's very like stable you know like selling stability [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9024.52s)]
*  but they were explaining it was all the stuff that um that trump and all those guys were talking [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9030.52s)]
*  about i can't remember the name of the company but they're like they're not on the internet we [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9037.32s)]
*  disconnect them from the internet it's all paper and then they're counted onto a computer that's [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9041.4s)]
*  not connected to anything or not even a computer a hard drive or whatever then we take the hard drive [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9047.800000000001s)]
*  and you can't there's no inputs so that's when i whenever i see stuff about [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9053.48s)]
*  manipulation or you know it's like i'm like it seems pretty and then you see people counting [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9061.48s)]
*  and they're being supervised and it all seems pretty not exactly foolproof because it's [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9067.24s)]
*  the interesting thing is by saying this i feel like a bitch right do you know what i mean like [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9072.119999999999s)]
*  i'm some naive toady for the government and stability which is the other thing it does [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9078.12s)]
*  being rational about it right but that's but the internet has made rational people [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9084.36s)]
*  seem like bitches and like only fools right only the fools right but it's a lot of fools but yeah [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9089.480000000001s)]
*  but you should be rational about it and what you're saying makes a lot of sense um the other thing [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9095.08s)]
*  that makes sense is what's interesting about that documentary hacking democracy that was all about [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9100.2s)]
*  the bush administration that was all about the republicans having to vote because that was [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9104.92s)]
*  i believe that company was a large contributor to the campaign so i think that was what they were [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9109.64s)]
*  worried like the owners of that company had a vested interest in the republicans winning [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9116.52s)]
*  and so that was that that was about hacking it in because that's we have to realize this people [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9120.44s)]
*  have always accused people of rigging votes they've they did it in 2016 since the beginning of voting [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9125.56s)]
*  yeah so human history because it's a natural human inclination to cheat especially like when [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9132.76s)]
*  it comes to we we know how much money is involved in being president how much power is involved in [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9137.64s)]
*  being president like god damn there's so many fucking factors and so many influences there's [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9141.56s)]
*  so much of an incentive for someone to do something if you are a person who's very invested in politics [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9146.36s)]
*  so much so that you're working for a polling place you know and you're like really you know [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9152.52s)]
*  hardcore one way or another hardcore right wing hard core left wing if you can get away with shit [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9157.72s)]
*  i'm sure you're going to do it but the question is like how many can get away with it and whether [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9162.84s)]
*  or not that actually can affect elections and like what about provisional ballots what about [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9167.16s)]
*  people that um don't have id what about people that are here illegally and vote because they [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9173.56s)]
*  feel like that's the trade-off for being able to be allowed into the country that's the the argument [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9180.039999999999s)]
*  about why they're letting so many people into this country right now now it's all technically [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9185.08s)]
*  backfiring because most immigrants are voting conservative latinos yeah it's fucking hilarious [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9189.96s)]
*  it's hilarious they don't want to hear your bullshit yeah it'll work yeah no i agree but that it's [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9196.52s)]
*  interesting to hear your take on this stuff because you're a part of it you know what i mean like [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9201.08s)]
*  when people talk about the this sort of whatever dark like this sort of not legacy media yeah not [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9208.92s)]
*  legacy information streams you're a big part of it and it's funny to hear that you're like i'm just [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9218.76s)]
*  trying to figure it out like everybody else i think everybody is trying to do that it's just [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9227.080000000002s)]
*  you should be allowed to do that the problem is everybody wants to come to a conclusion when [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9230.52s)]
*  they're not necessarily sure it's more convenient to have like a clear conclusion and there's a [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9234.12s)]
*  problem too when there's a narrative that gets floats around and if you question that narrative [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9239.960000000001s)]
*  like you're a kook or you're a bad person or you're a conspiracy theorist or you're contributing in [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9244.36s)]
*  some sort of a negative way like i do not like the idea of forced compliance i do not like the [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9249.0s)]
*  idea of buying into a narrative and as soon as i'm asked to do that but that's a thing that didn't [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9253.800000000001s)]
*  even exist it like didn't really exist before the internet the idea not the idea of forced [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9259.8s)]
*  compliance but just like i don't know we just this is what we're doing you know what i mean like and [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9266.039999999999s)]
*  then it became kind of weaponized of like you're a sheep and you're it's like where me i say like i [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9270.439999999999s)]
*  believe most of what's in the new york times you sheep ass bitch i don't necessarily agree with you [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9276.84s)]
*  because even during the vietnam war that was an issue i mean that was the division of society in [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9281.32s)]
*  the vietnam wars that people knew that the vietnam war was bullshit and they knew that they were being [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9285.48s)]
*  fed bullshit by the government and they're they're sending human bodies over there to just to go and [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9290.68s)]
*  die yeah you're absolutely right about that so and that changed culture and it's very radical [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9295.8s)]
*  way because people just were rejected all the norms of society and it's also came about the same time [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9300.279999999999s)]
*  as the introduction of lsd so people are doing acid and they're tripping and they just want to [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9306.359999999999s)]
*  drop out of society so that was going on then too it's it's a it's a normal part of human beings to [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9311.0s)]
*  question the people that have power and to reject it's also funny hearing you talk about it is it [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9318.36s)]
*  it makes you think it's now it's just kind of a different group the problem is it can't be involved [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9323.88s)]
*  in the dissemination of information as soon as all that money is involved in information it can [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9329.48s)]
*  choose what to and what not to talk about and when you only have an hour you're only on the show for [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9334.92s)]
*  an hour it's really easy to conveniently miss some really important stories it's also inevitable [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9340.6s)]
*  i don't even because i would say it's not even uh uh intentional to fuck with to ignore this it's [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9346.44s)]
*  bias could be its limitations it certainly could be certainly could be all those things but it also [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9355.800000000001s)]
*  could be political agenda that's possible too and the thing is like you shouldn't be expected to get [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9362.6s)]
*  the news in an hour especially today because you're dealing with the news of eight billion people [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9367.4s)]
*  simultaneously and you're only hearing the bad stuff you're hearing the bad stuff about typhoons [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9371.56s)]

*  seems like it's real similar to what goes on in a lot of religions in a sense because there's a [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9649.16s)]
*  lot of religions that force people to work as missionaries and there's a lot of religions that [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9653.48s)]
*  you know ask things of people and you have to tithe 10 and have kids and don't use birth control [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9657.72s)]

*  like what are we doing like if there's a central creation force and you interact with it like what [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9714.92s)]
*  is it what does it want what does it want from us and what is it doing with like life i my experience [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9720.04s)]

*  totally yeah recovered i feel like there's some sort of trend um in life and in in the cosmos [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9777.48s)]
*  of things getting more complex and you know i'm not the first person to point this out either [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9787.64s)]
*  but with human beings in particular everything is about technological innovation and things [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9795.16s)]
*  becoming more more complexed and information being more and more accessible and being more [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9802.2s)]
*  and more connected with each other it seems like a really really obvious trend and if you play that [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9807.480000000001s)]
*  trend out you know a thousand years a hundred thousand years a million years like where where [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9813.08s)]
*  is that going and is that going on all over the universe and is that what god's doing is god all [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9819.560000000001s)]
*  about this constant state of improvement that it goes on forever until you reach like literally [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9825.56s)]
*  like a god-like being where yeah yeah that's the thing with with uh i uh i had a few [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9832.76s)]
*  kind of rapture [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9845.16s)]
*  uh experience like ish rapture ish i just get the feeling that if if like [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9846.36s)]
*  when if there was a rapture or whatever i just think people will go wow this was we fucking were [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9856.2s)]
*  really worried about the wrong shit for sure like beyond even our comprehend like [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9862.52s)]
*  beyond our so far past what we were like not even worried about uh fucking or war or any of [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9871.4s)]
*  that stuff it's like dude it's just about this energy field that i couldn't make heads or tails [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9878.36s)]
*  of in terms of like we're supposed to well if you think of amoebas if you think of single-celled [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9887.0s)]
*  organisms they eventually become multi-celled organisms they they develop the ability to move [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9891.800000000001s)]
*  around and they they come on to shore and they evolve and change and this goes on forever and [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9897.24s)]
*  ever and ever and then one day in 2022 they're us that's what we are we're the most advanced [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9902.76s)]
*  form that we're aware of of that thing if that keeps going maybe that is what creates the [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9909.24s)]
*  universe itself maybe the universe is making itself through us we're just in this amoeba stage [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9915.16s)]
*  and we can't even comprehend it to us it's like what are you talking about we're going to change [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9920.6s)]
*  the world like imagine an amoeba being born in the bottom of a volcano silo you know in the bottom [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9924.12s)]
*  of the ocean so i felt like an amoeba on on five million yeah well you basically probably are i [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9929.160000000002s)]
*  think we probably all are a version of that in comparison to this ultimate thing that we're [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9934.28s)]
*  going to become if if we do keep evolving if if evolution is a real thing and it did go from [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9939.320000000002s)]
*  single-celled organisms to what we see now in human beings if you just keep going that should [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9945.0s)]
*  that should get to some place of impossible energy and power and maybe the universe itself [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9951.8s)]
*  like maybe that's what it's made out of maybe that's how we make things like stars and maybe [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9959.16s)]
*  the universe itself is born out of this and we're just this really tiny stage this amoeba like stage [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9965.880000000001s)]
*  that will ultimately become the god force of the universe maybe that's our ultimate transition [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9973.32s)]
*  between a physical being into this thing of energy and love and light and power and and in [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9979.32s)]
*  indifference in many ways to our own plights because it's it's necessary to achieve this purpose [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9986.44s)]
*  like all of our bullshit and maybe all of our struggles and maybe all of our debates about [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9991.8s)]
*  things and trying to figure out what's white and what's wrong whose philosophy is correct and whose [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=9996.84s)]
*  behavior is correct maybe all of that is just trying to get us to that ultimate stage where [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10000.279999999999s)]
*  we're going to be and that's what happens everywhere in the universe that's the universe [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10006.12s)]
*  creating itself everywhere all over the place when things get and they have a certain amount of [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10009.400000000001s)]
*  troubles that they have to deal with whether it's tribal invasions or super volcanoes and [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10014.84s)]
*  figure it out get to a point where you can become the next thing yeah and then on and on and on and [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10019.800000000001s)]

*  order things more than anything like that's our number one sort of human priority because it's [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10067.960000000001s)]

*  to do they're allowed to find someone manipulate them get them to do a crime that's not even a real [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10692.36s)]
*  crime and then like the one about the guy was in dallas he was a 19 year old kid very gullible [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10697.88s)]

*  there was no bomb it was a fake bomb yep they completely entrapped him yeah totally legal [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10729.0s)]
*  that was that most of the war on terror was that but they made a crime that's what's wild like the [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10733.880000000001s)]
*  crime didn't exist it's not like the guy's saying hey i'm gonna go blow up this fucking building and [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10739.640000000001s)]
*  then they swapped his bomb out for a fake one and then you know it was his plan this would be an [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10743.880000000001s)]
*  amazing tv show that we cannot never make right well how about the other one where there was the [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10748.2s)]
*  woman who the governor of the governor whitmer meg women they were gonna kidnap her it turned out [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10752.92s)]
*  like 13 of them were fbi informants there was like yeah two real dummies so funny [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10757.88s)]

*  but that's the cost of freedom that's what i'm saying it's like that's you can't you can't govern [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10778.28s)]
*  i gotta get out of here but you can't legislate i don't know how who who who legislates against [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10787.24s)]
*  it's a really good question it's a really good question like you can't give the power to the [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10795.16s)]
*  government to decide what's real and what's not real because we know they already lie to us [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10799.16s)]
*  like did you see that twitter is like fact-checking biden now which is hilarious fine a lot of the [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10802.6s)]
*  shit he says is not true fine that's great yeah so that shows you right there if the government [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10807.48s)]
*  had full control and they could just tweet whatever they wanted to and not get fact-checked [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10813.16s)]
*  which they kind of have been able to do before if they do that and they're the ones in charge of [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10816.92s)]
*  information and they can say what can and cannot be said they'll decide in their best interest [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10822.039999999999s)]
*  that's why you can't give it to people that are in power and it's it's better although it's chaotic [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10826.76s)]
*  as fuck to give it and leave it to the people it's better it's better than giving it to people that [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10831.72s)]
*  are in power because all they would have to do is institute some sort of a social credit score system [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10837.24s)]
*  which would be easy to talk gullible people into doing and next thing you know everything is tied [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10843.16s)]
*  into this in terms of what you can do and not do what you can say and not say and every time you [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10848.28s)]
*  say something that's out of line you lose social credit school maybe you can't fly maybe you can't [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10852.28s)]
*  buy a house and that's real and that's a that's why you can't give them access to information [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10857.08s)]
*  because if you do they'll limit the amount of information that stops them from [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10862.92s)]
*  implementing ideas like this yes and the alternative is terrifying in a different way [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10866.52s)]
*  it's all it's all bad but i think people are going to work it out i'm optimistic i hope you're right [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10873.720000000001s)]
*  i hope you're right i think we're better at this now than we were just a few years ago [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10879.48s)]
*  we're better at like seeing bullshit i think overall but i think it's a long process because [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10883.24s)]
*  it's a long process that we've gone through in a very short period of time like the process of [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10888.36s)]
*  information distribution it's like it's it's unprecedented and it's like crazy and then [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10892.76s)]
*  the radio and television now this straight up just yeah and you just like it's dmt basically [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10899.24s)]
*  yeah it's like a psychedelic information age yeah and we're not really totally prepared for it [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10905.48s)]
*  and we're not really qualified to manage it either or even built for it no not built for it like you [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10912.92s)]

*  is just they're wrong we're ordering for more people more commerce more more more more more [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10941.64s)]
*  instead of like moderation protect the tribe this is about the right amount of people we should have [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10948.2s)]
*  we'll respect the earth we'll respect the but it's just you just need in order [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=10954.76s)]

*  sure it's all deep i don't think that's going to be the solution i think the solution the imperfect [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11292.039999999999s)]
*  solution that we're currently wrestling with is the one is let the internet sort it out is just [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11297.24s)]
*  let it get messy let it get messy and figure it out over time and the truth comes to light you know [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11302.759999999998s)]
*  yeah i just worry that like people will die and and and institutions will it's part of the parish [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11308.519999999999s)]
*  i i process i don't disagree it's like when you talk about climate change i think toward the end [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11315.32s)]
*  of our lives i'd say let's was 2022 i bet in 2060 a billion people die in a decade from from climate [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11321.32s)]
*  change yeah um i don't know where you pulled that number out of your i just it's round anybody [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11333.88s)]
*  thinks it's that high but i think well if you think it like border like uh migration it's just [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11338.6s)]
*  going to be so much migration and then you saw with covet our borders closed just shit where it's like [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11344.84s)]
*  no you can't come here yeah but our border wasn't no no our border wasn't but australia's was china's [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11350.44s)]
*  was like certain countries would not allow people right right if there's a bunch of people in [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11355.960000000001s)]
*  bangladesh move and they have to get to higher land or cooler land or whatever it's too hot [[03:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11360.52s)]
*  yeah yeah or it's flooded yeah all there's a lot of problems and this guy uh bjorn lombard his [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11366.52s)]
*  assertion is that what we need to do is take care of all these people economically and that the [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11374.36s)]
*  people that are dying in these places are people that don't have access to air conditioning don't [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11378.04s)]
*  have access to refrigeration and if we raise them up economically then you could solve most of those [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11382.12s)]
*  people dying that was the guy yesterday and also he was talking about tuberculosis how many people [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11388.36s)]
*  died tuberculosis and that we could fix that it's like something like a million people a year it's [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11392.84s)]
*  really wild and then it's mostly poor people and then why aren't we freaking out about that we [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11397.08s)]
*  freak out about the things we're conveniently freaking out about and that that's a real issue [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11401.48s)]
*  that's like malaria malaria kills like you ever go on like charity navigator and send it what the [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11405.32s)]
*  most bang for your buck it's all malaria mosquito nuts mosquito nuts yeah he actually talked about [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11411.56s)]
*  that and he actually showed the deaths of malaria dying uh dropping down considerably [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11416.84s)]
*  because of medication because of uh modern medicine so there's you know i think his really [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11422.28s)]
*  interesting point is that there's a lot of other things that are really bad that we should be [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11428.6s)]
*  concentrating on as well and we're we're very now minded in our focus on this and it becomes the [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11431.880000000001s)]
*  cause of the day and everybody like you have to be all on board with this and if you really want to [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11437.400000000001s)]
*  save lives he's like there's a lot of other things that we could do and we can implement very quickly [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11442.28s)]
*  and easily and save lives and we also would probably elevate people economically which would [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11446.36s)]
*  in turn allow them to have measures in in place to protect them from environmental situations like [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11451.56s)]
*  extreme heat and drought and things like that and he thinks he can a lot of it can be done with [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11457.88s)]
*  innovation it's very complicated it's also hotly contested so much of it as you talk about this [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11462.68s)]
*  stuff so much of it is about persuasion yeah a lot of it is like okay we want to try telling [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11469.56s)]
*  american taxpayers that we're gonna send air conditioners to bangladesh well i think the [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11477.56s)]
*  idea is you bring uh their economy up somehow and if you bring their economy up then they can afford [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11484.039999999999s)]
*  things that's what he's saying he's saying like there's these places that have like they're [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11489.96s)]
*  completely economically disenfranchised and they're fucked and they have no hope and there's there's [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11494.76s)]
*  no options if we created options in those places and helped you know we're incentivized to help [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11498.68s)]
*  these people then their their way of life would improve radically and as their way of life [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11504.84s)]
*  improves radically and the economy improves radically you have way less deaths you have way [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11511.8s)]
*  less deaths from disease way less deaths from crime way less deaths from a lot of these things [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11515.880000000001s)]
*  yeah and then good yeah of course and he was saying economically it's more feasible it's very [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11520.04s)]
*  difficult to just we're gonna turn on your economy well no one's saying it's easy yeah and that's [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11525.4s)]
*  the other thing he was saying he was like none of these solutions are easy but these are other [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11530.04s)]
*  things that we should be constant if we're if our concern is quality of life and and raising up [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11534.6s)]
*  people's quality of life and giving them more of a chance to live making life safer for them making [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11539.560000000001s)]
*  things easier for them that he's like this is a good way to go about doing that and in turn it [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11544.76s)]
*  will greatly reduce the the deaths and these are all these are preventable deaths and we can greatly [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11549.720000000001s)]
*  reduce those and it's a real cause and effect thing like you could actually get to doing that [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11556.2s)]
*  so if our main concern is loss of life we should really be concerned with that as well that's what [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11560.92s)]
*  he's saying he's not not saying at all that climate change isn't a problem he's definitely [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11565.800000000001s)]
*  not saying that it's not caused by man he's like i my also take on this is like it's just a shame [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11569.800000000001s)]
*  do you know what i mean like i'm not saying like you're not i'm not hectoring and like [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11575.800000000001s)]
*  you need jill rogan what are you drinking that's not sustainable yeah like coffee sustainable what [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11579.16s)]
*  i'm saying it is uh what i'm saying is like man this is a fucking shame because human life [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11584.2s)]
*  human energy is a precious great thing it's precious we have so much of it yeah and to [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11591.480000000001s)]
*  the fuck up the earth like this ah what a fucking shame well it's obviously short-sighted and it's [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11597.960000000001s)]
*  obviously people that started doing things a long time ago that they didn't give a fuck about the [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11605.240000000002s)]
*  future or the other people that i deal with the consequences or they didn't realize it was causing [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11610.12s)]
*  those consequences yeah he was a little flippant about uh fracking i was like man they're like [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11614.36s)]

*  was like well relatively speaking you know there was a lot of like glass half full so i guess i get [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11623.560000000001s)]
*  it's important to hear that position too but uh yeah ultimately it's a fucking shame what we've [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11630.84s)]
*  done to the environment it's a shame you know he's also saying that the a lot of the stuff that's [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11636.44s)]
*  floating in the ocean is not simply like our stuff that washes the shore he's like it's these [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naqT4-F8e4&t=11640.76s)]
