# Joe Rogan Experience #1454 - Dan Crenshaw
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-DiuM5KsPM)
*  Congressman, how are you sir? I am doing well Joe good to see you again. You look
*  official bro. You look very official you have an American flag in the background
*  you got books have you read those books be honest with me. Yeah that's a good
*  question. I mean this one's like a congressional cookbook like I'm not
*  gonna read that so obviously. Some of these I have or at least I dabble in
*  books like I'll look over a book mostly I've definitely read my book that one's
*  up there I've read that way too many times I hate reading it now and that's
*  the one that's out right now I wrote it that's the one that's out right now that
*  comes out yeah that comes out I don't know when we're posting this but
*  Tuesday April 7th that's tomorrow yeah that's exactly when this will come out
*  so perfect fortitude we need that right now and we do we do know the rest of
*  this I just kind of set up for this I found that weird-ass painting right there
*  it's some like flea market in San Diego back when I was stationed there it's
*  like a it's like a it's a bunch of ships that looks like a horrible idea for a
*  tattoo you know sometimes people have those really bad old ship tattoos I yeah
*  I feel like there's worse tattoos you could get oh yeah I've got them is there
*  what about the typewriter do you use the typewriter is that legit that is a
*  legit typewriter that was my granddad's old typewriter so I saved that they kept
*  it in pretty good shape I didn't really have to do much restoring but you can
*  still buy the ink for that and actually we would we used to have it set up in
*  the house so when guests came over they could like typewrite a message and so
*  it's like a guest log it's kind of cool that is cool thing so what's your take
*  on what we're going through right now Dan for everybody in the future this is
*  day it's basically a month into like extreme coronavirus lockdown for the
*  country it all started sort of in the beginning of March now here we are in
*  the first week of April and everybody's stir crazy and weirded out by this
*  including me and I'm sure you as well what is your take on this Wow generally
*  speaking I remember I remember the weekend where everything all of a
*  sudden shifted it was the March 14th weekend I remember that weekend because
*  it was my birthday and I remember how everybody was basically still going out
*  to bars and restaurants and then all of a sudden everything changed like the
*  entire paradigm changed and I could go through a long timeline of how we got
*  there there's a lot of finger-pointing right now a lot of opportunism the
*  reality is a lot of us didn't pretty much everybody didn't know a whole lot
*  and then we ended up in this situation where and now my general take on it we
*  are in a what I would call a tactical retreat so I'm gonna use a military term
*  there to describe what we are doing we all of a sudden ran into a hail of gun
*  fire okay like and I think about this in military terms we're on a patrol we run
*  into a hail of gunfire we're not really sure what hit us we have a basic idea we
*  know who they are we know generally what the enemy is but we weren't quite sure
*  how to combat it so we took a retreat tactically speaking that retreat looks a
*  lot like a lockdown okay don't talk to anybody don't don't touch anybody
*  maintain that social distancing lock things down we have to slow the spread
*  and allow our backup our public health system to catch up at a certain point we
*  have to come out of that tactical pause we have to come out of that retreat and
*  start engaging in the enemy a little bit now we do that slowly we do it carefully
*  and so I think that's the I like to look at it that way is the conversation about
*  how to reopen society at a certain point we have to move away from risk
*  containment and remove into a risk mitigation strategy and we're ramping up
*  our production of things like ventilators of PPE of testing capability
*  in order to do that now there's some talk of when this is gonna end and I
*  don't know how you even make that distinction how does one make a
*  decision and it seems like one of those things where once it starts once you
*  lock a country down and tell people stay away stay home don't go to work don't do
*  anything unless it's very essential like grocery stores hospitals media there's
*  certain things that are allowed to be done right now when does that end and
*  how does one decide when that ends yeah there's a lot of different ways to think
*  about that from from the public health perspective I hear them say certain
*  things like after 14 days of a downward trend in cases then we can start
*  reopening when the are is less than one then you can start reopening so are
*  being less than one means for every contagious person they infect less than
*  one other person right now that numbers are at just over two okay so there's
*  there's an obvious spread that occurs that I have I think those are valid
*  assumptions I definitely question using those as our standards I would like to
*  see us use other standards as well such as are we at a point where we're testing
*  enough and we have enough ventilators and hospital bed space and PPE to
*  actually fight the virus alongside reopening our society because I think we
*  have to come to terms with a very certain truth which is we cannot
*  indefinitely lock down those costs are enormous and they're not just cost to
*  our 401ks and our jobs I mean there's a public health cost there too you know I
*  speak with doctors here in Houston we don't we don't have a huge case number
*  in Houston where our hospitals are like 50% empty right now and they can't do
*  much needed surgeries procedures because you know what's called an elective
*  surgery is going to be kind of a gray area so a lot of stuff isn't getting done
*  from a public health side also there's there's there's I think the obvious
*  public health crisis when people don't have jobs there's divorce rates there's
*  suicides we have to really take all of this into account as we as we talk about
*  one to reopen society yeah we you and I privately had this conversation through
*  text messages about the way reporters are using this moment to criticize Trump
*  with in ridiculous ways and one of them was this questioning of whether or not
*  he should describe these drugs that have some promise which many doctors are
*  describing hydroxychloroquine with a Z pack and zinc apparently is a combination
*  that keeps getting brought up and there's a doctor that has been using this
*  to some reported success in New York City but what drives me crazy is that
*  these are rare opportunities that someone has to talk to the president and
*  they're using it to chastise him for bringing up drugs that do show promise
*  and hope he's not telling people to go take it is not advocating it is not
*  pretending that he's some sort of a medical professional he's just talking
*  about some things that show promise in the medical community you know what is
*  your take on all this because this is a weird situation he finds himself in
*  with the press this very strange and antagonistic position yeah you know the
*  press needs to figure out who they want to be and it's actually like chapter 2
*  in my book it's called who is your hero and that in that conversation is about
*  who we think we should be like what kind of people do we think we should be what
*  does it mean to be a good American a good citizen the press believes it is
*  their duty to only be adversarial to to politicians mostly conservative
*  politicians they don't treat Democrats the same way but and that is their job
*  okay I wish they would treat all all all politicians the same and to an extent
*  that is their job to be adversarial to question what is coming out of government
*  but I would argue that their main purpose is to simply educate the public
*  educate the public with full that's a fax full context full understanding of
*  what's going on I think on that point they're utterly failing I mean to a
*  huge extent I think they've been failing for a long time but in a time of crisis
*  where it's so important that they actually do that that that more
*  important thing of informing the public they're really failing and they they do
*  that they completely waste time I mean how many reporters actually get access to
*  the president I bet there's hundreds of thousands of reporters out there good
*  love to be able to be in that press briefing room and actually ask
*  legitimate questions that would inform the American public but but they don't
*  they play these gotcha games now the last questions like what do you want to
*  say to people who are upset with you right now it's like what how is how is
*  that a good question how's that news right I mean I mean it was it's so
*  utterly absurd and and unnecessary I have a list of questions I don't want to
*  read them all but they're there they're a complete waste of time and I think
*  they're failing us miserably and then there's the opportunism that occurs like
*  listen there's if you're writing an op-ed if you're a journalist writing an
*  op-ed let's say an opinion journalist especially I I fully understand why you
*  might you might say you might write in your report okay the president said this
*  today but three weeks ago they said this so there's been a change that's fine
*  that makes total sense that provides context to the reader even it might be
*  biased and that whatever but but but but to but to only do that indirect
*  questioning with the president just to try and play this gotcha game I it's not
*  helpful it's not helpful at all and it's not informing anybody in the least you
*  know you mentioned the the president talking favorably about the chloroquine
*  or hydroxychloroquine and you remember the the couple that ingested that out
*  in Arizona because that I something something similar to I think it's a
*  chloroquine phosphate or something like that it might be misspeaking it's
*  poison but that's an yeah it's an ingredients on fishbowl cleaner yeah
*  fish tank cleaner and so they saw it and they ingested it which was obviously a
*  terrible idea nobody would nobody told them to do that and then the media the
*  media instead of saying wow this is a shame that they did this they blame the
*  president and they blame the president for talking about what is a at least
*  anecdotally a proven way to to combat this disease we don't know through
*  clinical trials whether in mass it'll actually work but but to express
*  optimism over it it doesn't seem to be a punishable offense but the outrage mob
*  is was fully invested in this kind of outrage reasoning to to tear down the
*  president over this and it's just it just feels so unnecessary I mean that's
*  right that's why I wrote this book the book is about outrage culture and our
*  and are like this sort of weird new cultural need to just go after each
*  other in the worst of ways there's a new ability to do that I mean this is what
*  it is with these new tools that people have through social media and through
*  making these viral video clips which is what each reporter is hoping is they're
*  going to accomplish by being combative with the president and trying to catch
*  him on something they're hoping that they're going to create this viral video
*  that's going to accelerate their career it's it's very self aggrandizing it's
*  and it's disturbing that there's there's not someone who stands out that does
*  these sort of press junkets that doesn't do that yeah and I actually write about
*  that exact point in my book like this what we've begun to do is reward this
*  sort of I would say overly passionate emotional behavior so we've replaced
*  sophisticated reasoning with outrage you know we started to change who we
*  actually viewed as heroes this is how I describe it we all have hero archetypes
*  okay and like and we grew up this way and there's there's like fictional
*  characters like the Jedi like it's a that's like a hero archetype or Superman
*  we kind of look up to this person or or like or like real characters like Rosa
*  Parks or Jesus like there's there's people that we actually look up to and
*  we identify with and there's certain attributes that we use and we say I want
*  to be like that and so when I act in public I'm going to I'm going to I'm
*  going to access that attribute I'm going to be better and according according to
*  that archetype and we've sort of turned that on its head and in our in our
*  current outrage mob culture like we see somebody who plays the victim and we
*  cheer them on when reality what we used to do is see somebody who overcame
*  adversity who was a true hero and then we cheered them on we've totally reversed
*  that yeah and like so and so and so you actually get more points if you're more
*  snarky if you're meaner if you're if you're if you're playing this kind of
*  cheap shot game and like in my book I use this example of like these these
*  this group of veterans they they were waiting for me outside of my office
*  I was going and I knew something was off because veterans my age they we never
*  wear the like the ball cap you know like with the gold letters that say veteran
*  on it we never wear that but these guys were wearing that so that was that was
*  my first sign that something was different about these guys but they just
*  asked for a picture and I figured that was it and I would keep going but the
*  second thing that was off was like they they weren't they weren't looking at the
*  camera they were fiddling as I was like posing for this camera for this photo
*  and I thought that was strange and it turns out they were just getting their
*  own video camera ready to record and then they start following me and like
*  they lose their minds talking about Trump and you know betraying the country
*  and just all this nonsense and so they were just trying to have a gotcha moment
*  with you yeah yeah yeah this is what they do they're a they're an activist
*  group and they'll corner people like me and try and get like a viral video going
*  and and then you know it's up to me at that point to just like understand
*  what's happening it's kind of walks silently and I kind of engage with them
*  in some funny ways but they were they were becoming extremely emotional I mean
*  their voices started to crack it was which was you know and what were they
*  saying about you or to you oh how could you how could you let how could you
*  betray the country by supporting the president I mean things like that it
*  mostly sloganeering like this wasn't a like a deep conversation by any means but
*  but that's the point the point is is that they're rewarded for that like
*  overly emotional in motion like you know filming while while walking type of type
*  of scenario and then they like and then there's this whole deal where I have to
*  get in the elevator because that's how I get to the votes like I leave my my
*  office on the fourth floor in cannon I take the elevator down in the basement
*  I walk across like that's just my route and so but what they do is as I get into
*  the elevator they're like so he's hiding from us he's running away from us and
*  the Newsweek like writes up the same story like there's this there's this
*  entire culture behind this notion that you that you that you have to use as
*  much emotion as possible and as an express your anger in the most
*  exceptional of ways otherwise it's not worth listening to but we haven't
*  stopped as a culture and we have to stop rewarding it and that's what I talk about
*  we have to stop rewarding that kind of behavior so that it actually ceases to
*  control us that way well they accomplished what they wanted to do we're
*  talking about them right now although you didn't give up their name good for
*  you but you talked about them and that's what they wanted I mean there's so many
*  groups out there that are I don't even know if they have an endgame the the end
*  game seems to just get attention and you know and shine the light on these
*  atrocities or whatever the whatever they feel like is an atrocity it is attention
*  it happens on both sides I'm pretty careful in my book to actually criticize
*  both sides on this one because it means I do see it in the conservative circles
*  it's it's different the the kind of outrage culture that happens in
*  conservatism is certainly different and less widespread than then happens on the
*  left it is more about attention seeking and and I always tell people that if
*  you're gonna if your main goal is getting more followers and more clicks
*  then you know you have to reevaluate what your priorities are and I worry
*  about the activist community as well which is activists sometimes don't want
*  to win they don't actually want to win the argument and that should concern us
*  because at least politically speaking my goal is to win the argument and to win
*  the argument I have to actually persuade people and like that that should be the
*  goal we those lengthier conversations again it's why these kind of podcasts
*  are so prevalent well I do my own podcast because I want to dive deep into
*  some of these issues on a substantive level well I do appreciate your
*  reasonable and balanced perspective because you are one of the rare guys
*  that's on the right that does criticize the right and do and you do it fairly
*  and objectively which I think is very important in this day and age you know I
*  I'm on the left but I find myself more and more getting confused like a man
*  without a country or man with you know without a side rather without a team
*  there's so many people on the left now that want to silence people freedom of
*  speech was always a core tenant of what this country is based on the ability to
*  express yourself but there's so many people that want people deep platformed
*  for having views that they disagree with or ideas that they disagree with and
*  this is an enormous problem obviously in social media well to bring it back to
*  there was there was certain messages that were being taken down by Twitter if
*  they were and I and I think these the kind of type of messages or articles
*  that were being promoted along the lines of hate there's there's too much
*  economic cost we need to we need to reopen the economy and get people back
*  to work if it was things like that Twitter was taking them down I don't
*  know if they're still doing that but I but I heard reports of it and you know on a
*  broader scale yeah the the attack against freedom of speech is is by far
*  one of the most concerning elements that concerns I think classical liberals and
*  if that's how you would describe yourself I don't know what to all of us
*  in the political world Joe Rogan's political leanings are like the great
*  mystery and frankly we kind of like it that way it makes you it keeps you out
*  of the fray it's more of a mystery now as I said that I wouldn't vote for Biden
*  that I said I would vote for Trump over Biden all these people went crazy
*  everybody but let me let me be clear you know what I'd also vote for Whoopi
*  Goldberg over Joe Biden I'd vote for Mike Tyson over Joe Biden I just don't
*  think it's a good idea to take someone who's struggling with dementia and put
*  him in one of the most stressful positions the world has ever known
*  that's what I'm saying I mean it's not an endorsement of Trump it is it is a me
*  saying you shouldn't have a man who's clearly clearly in the throes of
*  dementia I mean there's I'm not a doctor but when you can't form sentences in
*  public and you forget what you're talking about and you you wander off
*  into these conversations if you're not smoking pot you're not high if you're
*  not pills like what's going on well there's cognitive decline he's an older
*  man that has mental issues and you know not to be cruel to him he's he's
*  suffering medically this is a real issue and the Democrats want to sweep
*  that under the rug and Trump is already chewing him apart he's already dismissing
*  him I mean there is a recent thing that Kyle Kalinsky posted a video on his
*  Twitter talking about this is what happens when you don't discuss the
*  elephant in the room and it's Trump saying he used to do it during a press
*  conference and they asked him a question about something that Biden wrote he was
*  Biden didn't write that he's like he's that's a Democratic operative he didn't
*  read it he probably doesn't even know what's going on right now and he's gonna
*  he's gonna continue to do that and it's it's such a vulnerable point and I I
*  don't know why the Democrats thought it would be a good idea to take someone
*  who's clearly got a problem and this is I mean I don't want to be mean to the
*  guy but we've all seen it that's not normal it's not normal to forget like
*  when he's talking about the creator and he literally loses what he's saying he's
*  like you know the thing like the declaration of independence yes now I
*  mean that's a very simple document there's a bunch of those things like
*  when he was talking about the cure and losing what he's saying that you have to
*  take care of the cure and he's he's struggling the guy's struggling he's
*  tired this is an extremely stressful process to run for president and the
*  idea that he's gonna be able to get through this and be okay on the other
*  side to run the country for four potentially eight years is crazy yeah and
*  on a more from a policy perspective if we're looking at the coronavirus in
*  particular and the handling of it you know this is obviously the subject of
*  hot debate you know there's there's plenty of bad faith journalists out
*  there who continue and politicians including Pelosi who continue to repeat
*  that Trump has the deaths of thousands on his hands I think that's a horrible
*  horrible overstatement I mean to say the least it's just fundamentally not true
*  but we need to remember Joe Biden just recently acknowledged that he now agrees
*  with Trump's decision to close down travel from China in January and I go
*  through a long I recorded a podcast I almost have as many subscribers as you
*  do now I'm sure the no I don't where I go through a timeline of what actually
*  happened right like let's let's actually look into this debate in an objective
*  way of who knew what and when because you can criticize people for sure and
*  because hindsight is 20 20 but it's important to put yourself in the moment
*  and what we all knew at certain times and certain decisions were made and I
*  have to point out that back when we did this travel restriction from China in
*  late January at that same time the World Health Organization was saying that was
*  repeating Chinese claims in mid-January that this virus couldn't even be
*  transmitted in human-to-human contact you know and Trump was ripped apart for
*  that Biden ripped him apart for that Biden continued to rip him apart for
*  that up until a couple weeks ago so like you know these decisions saved
*  countless lives and and it's pretty obvious that Biden I mean he said it so
*  of course it's obvious that he would have made a different decision and we
*  would be in a much different place right now and to put aside all of the issues
*  that you pointed out those are those are certainly issues and I don't need to
*  repeat them I don't need to go into it but it's um it's because it's obvious
*  it is obvious but that's crazy that this is the guy that's running for president
*  you know and and then when people got upset at saying that you know me saying
*  that I would vote I'd probably vote for Trump before I'd vote for Biden I'm
*  literally saying I'd vote for anybody that can talk I mean anyone who's not
*  in in severe cognitive decline I mean pick a person shit I'd vote for Hillary
*  before I'd vote for him literally I mean I just I just think the poor guy
*  shouldn't be in the position he's in I don't understand why they're doing that
*  I mean anyone else could have been Tulsi Gabbard Amy Klobuchar Pete Buttigieg
*  pick a person they all would have been a better choice I mean this is crazy and I
*  don't know what their strategy is I don't know why they decided to do this it
*  makes no sense to me it's very very confusing yeah well there was a there
*  was a couple days where it all happened where you know behind the scenes all of
*  these different candidates basically basically said okay we're all gonna quit
*  because we they're so afraid of Bernie winning they don't think Bernie can win
*  the Democrat nominee or to win the general election I tend to agree with
*  that and I'm I you know I'm very much against Bernie winning the general
*  election but that's not the point the point is is that the DNC didn't want
*  that they and and they made moves to make that happen and the Democratic
*  Party as a whole is trying to find out who they are you know I look back in
*  time and the Democrat Party to me seems more like a Labour Party and that
*  changed over time into a highly progressive activist party where the
*  labor side of that is really just an afterthought and and it has really
*  become this sort of well a Democratic Socialist Party when do you think that
*  happened to make it so very recently because I wouldn't even describe
*  President Obama as I mean he definitely he definitely paved the way for it he's
*  definitely way more progressive than Clinton but it appears to me that it
*  happened very recently I have another theory as to how this happened I think I think the kind of
*  language that is often used by by a lot of well-meaning Democrats over time in
*  this sort of Labour Party era but let's call it the Bill Clinton era and before
*  that the language they used was still rather radical and revolutionary and
*  kind of you know coming up from the the children of the 60s and that kind of
*  revolutionary feel this this idea that a progressive utopia can solve more and
*  more of your problems if you just expand government control that we put enough
*  experts at the top we can figure all this out and we can make your problems
*  go away I think for a long time though they had the Republican Party to always
*  just be against that and and say hold on wait a second there's there's there's
*  other consequences to doing that and it was almost like there was this sort of
*  this sort of unspoken balance the thing and I'm not even sure that they believed
*  it themselves but over time their young people did believe it and so now you
*  have AOC who I think truly believes these things he truly believes in the
*  virtues of socialism I think Bernie believes in the virtues of socialism I
*  think he's dead wrong on this but but he believes it and I think a new generation
*  believe a new generation of progressives are true believers in a way that I'm not
*  so sure they were before and they're much louder because of their platforms
*  on social media and they're able to change the direction of their party in a
*  much more powerful way than I think they they had been able to in the past and we
*  see that in Congress to an extraordinary degree where where somebody like me now
*  views Pelosi is sort of in the middle between moderates and extremists and you
*  know ten years ago we would have we would have described Nancy Pelosi as an
*  But now I view her as sort of center-left and the extremists are even to her left and she's
*  deeply afraid of those those that that progressive squad because of their power
*  on social media and media in general so it's an interesting battle.
*  Do you think that this shift is because it seems like nothing works perfectly
*  and this hasn't really been tried or implemented on a large scale in the
*  United States democratic socialism they don't think of it as socialism the way
*  Bernie describes it when you talk to him in person it sounds very reasonable he
*  said it sounds like he's looking out for the rights of the workers and he the way
*  he described finding this money just taking a small tax on speculation
*  gambles that Wall Street does do you think it's because nothing has worked
*  ideally and that this hasn't been tried before so they look at this as this
*  could be the solution that solves all this for us and sort of balances out
*  the economic playing field.
*  Yeah well I mean I would of course if he was making that argument and he does I
*  would simply say of course it's been tried before that's the same kind of
*  rhetoric that was used to to move into the socialist policies of the 20th
*  century where tens of millions of people died and I would also I would also put
*  it into this other way of thinking about it.
*  Yeah you can you can put forward these these seemingly innocuous ideas okay
*  we're gonna tax a little bit here and on that specific policy by the way that
*  that's not what people think it is you tax a little bit there that has wide
*  ranging effects on every single transaction that you would make in the
*  stock market I think this is the Warren and I think Bernie Sanders has the same
*  policy that you're describing but I remember I remember analyzing Elizabeth
*  Warren's policy which is again the same it would have drastic effects on
*  everybody's 401ks on pensions and these are working-class people that own these
*  things this isn't just the wealthy that they that they describe it as so on one
*  hand there's always a lot more there's a lot more layers to the policy that they
*  put out than they're then they're really letting on and there's a lot more
*  second-order consequences than they're letting on. On the other hand as far as
*  it not being tried what they're describing is a is a fast path to the
*  the nationalization of production that owning the means of production setting
*  price controls and they talk about setting price controls okay setting
*  setting wages is price controls setting prices is price controls I mean we
*  passed a bill out of the house HR 3 which they claim lowers people's drugs
*  drug prices and these evil Republicans like us we're all against it because you
*  know because we just don't want people to have low drug prices of course that's
*  not true the reality is is that when you analyze what it means to implement price
*  controls you lose supply that's just economics 101 that that has to be true
*  it always is true that that's why people starved in malice China and the Soviet
*  Union because they put price controls on food and they did production quotas and
*  they believe they truly believe that the government could figure out how much to
*  produce and what price to sell it at and that they would be a perfect utopia
*  after that well of course it doesn't work even for simple as simple something
*  as simple as farming and food production it doesn't work at all people
*  starved as a result and so it's even more unlikely that it would work for
*  more complicated parts of the economy like wages and drug prices because the
*  reality is in the Congressional Budget Office confirmed this many other states
*  confirm this we would have up to 30 less new drugs over the next couple decades
*  if you implement that kind of legislation and so they forget to tell you
*  that you're actually making a choice between these price controls and
*  actually having the cure in the first place and what I tell people is like the
*  affordability is definitely important and we should continue to tackle that
*  problem and and there are ways to do that but the thing has to exist before
*  you can afford it it has to actually exist can I pause you for a second there
*  how do you implement that without making putting a cap on the amount that a drug
*  I mean how do you make it more affordable
*  well so well there's other bills that we're in favor of that do that so one
*  way is is improve the way that generic drugs get to market so just like any
*  innovation there's a patent on it okay well once that patent ends what happens
*  is some pharmaceutical companies do take advantage of the system and maybe they
*  continue to put out different drugs that are slightly different than the last one
*  it extends their their their patent or they'll actually pay off generic
*  manufacturers to not produce it so there's a lot of these little loopholes
*  that we can actually tackle surgically and make sure that doesn't happen we
*  also have to remember the a lot of these stories are are anecdotal they they they
*  they are they're about a few different drugs and instead of instead of wide
*  price controls on everything that a pharmaceutical company actually creates
*  we should be looking at some of these life-saving drugs that we want people to
*  have but we also want to don't want to destroy the foundation of innovation and
*  research and development that it took to make that drug in the first place and so
*  how do we do that well I mean there's ways there's there's ways to reinsure it
*  at a certain caps of when insurance companies don't want to pay the
*  exorbitant amounts that it would cost you know there's there's other options
*  for reinsurance but it's it's you have to tackle it one at a time there's
*  there's more complicated ways to do it with the way that pharmacy companies do
*  rebates with the insurance companies that gets into a really complicated
*  discussion but there's ways to do that for instance for insulin that was a
*  Republican bill that we tried to pass an ENC that got shot down but it would have
*  driven down prices for something like insulin. Was there anything else attached
*  to that? I mean why did it get shot down? That was just an amendment because people
*  don't understand it listen I think I think Democrats they they love the idea
*  of these very simple fixes we want things to be cheaper so they will just
*  be cheaper by law we want people to make more money so we will just make the
*  minimum wage $15 we'll just make it that way and everything will be fine there'll
*  be no consequences to that no second third-order effects but there are
*  second and third-order effects and when we ignore those second third-order
*  effects we ignore them at our peril and in the case of the $15 minimum wage
*  well you can't ignore the fact that companies are just going to hire less
*  people you know that their their budget doesn't change just because you change
*  the minimum wage with respect to drug innovation they're just they just won't
*  invest in something and it takes billions and billions of dollars to
*  invest in these drugs for the massive amounts of costs that it takes to to do
*  the clinical trials that take years that I can't remember the average on top of
*  my head but it's enormous and an enormous amount of time and so you're
*  not going to get somebody to take that risk if there's not any payoff at the
*  end and I think that's that's what we forget we have to balance that quite a
*  bit I would also remind everybody of this with respect to the drug price
*  discussion that bill that HR 3 bill it won't become law because the Senate
*  won't take it up and the president won't sign it but if it did it wouldn't hurt
*  big pharma I think Democrats would like to believe that it would hurt big
*  pharmaceutical companies it wouldn't it would put all of the smaller startup
*  biotech companies totally out of business because they're the ones who
*  actually they start that innovation just just just like happens in Silicon Valley
*  these startups start it and then they get bought out by the bigger companies
*  that's sort of how the system works and it's a very dynamic system it's it's
*  it's why we are the by far the number one innovator in the world no other
*  country innovates like we do they don't do the research like we do if we
*  implemented the price controls that are inherent in Medicare for all or HR 3
*  there wouldn't be anybody else in the world doing what we do I can I can relate
*  that back to the coronavirus discussion too on because there's the there's like
*  discussion about you know should we have Medicare for all doesn't coronavirus
*  prove that everybody should have free health care and again what I what I have
*  to remind everybody is is that if we had Medicare for all what we're basically
*  talking about our price controls because Medicare already pays below average
*  payment for for anything for whatever service wherever for whatever doctor
*  visit it's about 60 70 percent on the dollar what is that stop you right there
*  Medicare is available for who right now what was the seniors Medicare is a senior
*  program but it's so what it what age is it does it kick in is it 65 I believe so
*  yeah I don't want to confuse it with Social Security so the idea is that for
*  older folks we should give them health care and make sure that their basic
*  needs are covered in terms of sickness illness injury and such yeah yeah I mean
*  the entire you know we could argue that we could we could even debate the merits
*  of Medicare on its face but Medicare would be available for everybody now if
*  Medicare for for all was available for everybody what you're saying is it was
*  essentially you would fix prices on everything in terms of medical
*  treatments and and that would be a problem because of what well so okay so
*  once you fight once you fix prices well imagine this and imagine if if if the
*  government said that your podcast could could only take a hundred dollars per
*  ad and that was just the price fix from now on what incentive would you have to
*  really expand your audience what expensive one incentive would you have
*  to keep going or expand the business you wouldn't be able to it's similar under
*  any industry once you once you fix that price you're going to reduce the supply
*  that goes in time stop you on that analogy yeah here's the problem with
*  that the difference is if they would do it have to be a reason why they would
*  say that I could only get a hundred dollars per ad the reason why you would
*  say that things shouldn't cost too much for someone who's injured or sick is
*  because we want to take care of each other as a community and the idea is
*  that healthcare should be something but we provide so many services to people
*  that we are united right we're in the United States of America we're supposed
*  to be a gigantic community and one of the great things that we could do for
*  each other is to make sure that if someone's sick or injured and something's
*  wrong that we can take care of that we would like everybody to do their share
*  and we would like everybody to chip in so that this is possible but there's a
*  big difference between that and fixing the price on an ad well no but not
*  economically there's no difference morally there is and I agree with you
*  morally we do have that we have the same goal of getting everybody out of quick
*  care right but from an economic standpoint but from an economic
*  standpoint my point still stands and you can apply that to any industry I see
*  what you're saying but I think we're looking at medical care as a basic human
*  right instead of just an economic issue the reason I don't describe it as it
*  it's not in your right it is both a moral and an economic issue but for my
*  argument that you will reduce supply that is fundamentally true it is
*  fundamentally true we see it in other countries it's why as we compare
*  ourselves to other countries right now all these places with socialized
*  medicine it's it's important to look at some stats and actually I have them here
*  I could take the time to pick them up but I'll but I'll but I'll give you the
*  bottom line up front we have overwhelmingly per capita more ICU beds
*  in this country than any other Western country overwhelmingly per capita we
*  have more ventilators than any of these other people we're all we're all
*  freaking out right now because we're worried about our ventilators and in our
*  ICU beds on a per capita basis our system has way way more than the UK then
*  Italy then Spain then Germany all of them like like orders of magnitude more
*  okay so okay also we're the ones who innovate I mean the vast majority of
*  research and development new drugs that come out that comes from this country so
*  these are these are facts that we can't escape if we do price controls and
*  Medicare for all is fundamentally a system of price controls if we do that
*  economically speaking we absolutely will reduce supply now I understand the
*  moral argument you're making which is we still want to help people yes we should
*  we should be looking for the ways to do that but I want to be able to do that in
*  a way that doesn't undercut the foundations of the good parts of our
*  health care system which is quality and innovation if we undercut those things
*  we're the last country doing this we're the last country in the world truly
*  doing innovation the world is left out to dry
*  can I pause you there that this what you're saying makes a lot of sense is
*  there a way to do both is there a way to provide health care to everyone but also
*  encourage this innovation encourage profit so you encourage these companies
*  to do all these great things that you're describing and maintain this
*  incredibly high level of health care that we have right now that's certainly
*  the goal right and that that should be the goal and this is why I think there's
*  there's got to be room for compromise on the health care debate because you can't
*  compromise with the other party if the goals aren't the same like I've come to
*  believe that our goals on immigration are actually not the same okay so it's
*  hard to compromise on health care they should be the same like because we we we
*  want everybody to have access to quality health care now they have a very
*  different way of getting to that point we have probably a much more complicated
*  we recognize how difficult it is to get to that point while also ensuring that
*  we maintain quality and an innovation and so what I'm working on personally is
*  is the primary care side of things okay so primary care doctor is your that's
*  your first point of contact in health care and the system that I think works
*  best for that is direct primary care so direct primary care basically means that
*  you Joe you're a doctor you can handle about 250 300 patients at a time they
*  all pay you a subscription fee of about $75 a month and they have full access to
*  you so it's like less than a cell phone bill this already exists this model is
*  prevalent it's growing I would like to see it grow much faster okay how do you
*  do that well we can subsidize lower-income people in order to do that
*  now how we do that is very complicated that's what I'm working out and within
*  our complicated system but that's an idea to want to make that free market
*  model actually take off so that people who don't need help with their health
*  care costs like like you and me we can still afford that just like we afford
*  any other monthly cost and you have access to preventive medicine you have
*  access to telemedicine you actually have a doctor-patient relationship that makes
*  it a lot easier to start solving the rest of the problem making our insurance
*  market more competitive making putting more choice in it directly subsidizing
*  those who need it but in a way that looks a lot more like Medicare
*  Advantage so Medicare Advantage is a part of Medicare that basically forces
*  competition and choice between insurance companies it came out to be a lot cheaper
*  than we originally thought it would in the early 2000s when this thing was
*  created this was a Republican plan because there's certain foundations that
*  I think we have to adhere to any time we want to problem-solve choice and
*  competition are among them you can't escape those things and I think when we
*  talk about Medicare for all it tries to it tries to move past these essential
*  foundations whether of a free society that we have to adhere to and and because
*  the other thing I push back on a little bit is the health care is a right
*  statement and I push back against that because what that when you're calling
*  something a right what you're effectively saying is that somebody else
*  has a obligation to serve you and it's hard to call something a right when that
*  right requires the service of somebody else don't we already do that with the
*  firemen don't we do that with the police department don't we do that with public
*  schools not exactly no I mean we have public services that I would I would
*  distinguish those public services from something like a direct point of care
*  and I would distinguish them to an enormous extent like but and here's why
*  you can add a few hundred thousand more people to a you know to to the nation's
*  population and it doesn't change the mission of the military right like it
*  doesn't it doesn't take an away thing away from them but these but because of
*  the sort of non-rival this is like an economic and economics term but the sort
*  of non-rival attribute of these things it is different right because there's
*  only select number of doctors and we've already said that once you put price
*  controls in there's going to be less doctors because doctors will be paid
*  less they'll get burned out more they'll then hospitals will be able to actually
*  never finish that point the reason price controls reduce supply and we're using
*  we see supply reductions in other countries is because well hospitals
*  don't get the same amount of money they're not going to invest in that
*  extra ICU bed they're not going to buy those extra ventilators they're not
*  going to hire those other doctors a doctor doesn't want to be a doctor
*  because they don't make the amount of money that they thought they would make
*  they're doing extra work because there's more people who now have access to them
*  but there's less of them so wait lines are huge and they're seeing
*  multiple more patients a day doctor burnout increases quite a bit that's the
*  quick answer as to why why that happens but does that kind of answer your
*  question it was getting really that does yeah the human right issue we kind of
*  moved around with that this the idea that it's different than the fire
*  department or the police department or well it's not a right either actually
*  the the fire department's not necessarily a right as we would but it's
*  a public service that's provided to everyone yeah it is but it but but but
*  understand so let's call it a public service then and let's call doctor
*  healthcare a public service as well if we were to do Medicare for all but
*  wouldn't the result be the same if it's provided for everyone um not from a
*  practical standpoint just because it's much easier again you could add a
*  hundred thousand people more to your city and the fire department would have
*  marginally more more work to do you know compared to like an a doctor for
*  instance does that make sense like you just it doesn't I think on a if we're
*  trying to compare them in that sense that that non-rival attributes matter
*  it matters quite a bit if I'm describing that correct so what you're saying is
*  because competition is necessary with medical innovation and also like
*  doctors profit off of being exceptional so you you they have incentive to be
*  exceptional no no what I'm saying is if you have if you have ten doctors that's
*  that are serving a community every time that doctor is serving somebody it means
*  somebody else can't see them well isn't that just a signal that we need more
*  doctors and more hospitals they're understaffed yeah it would be yes but
*  I'm saying that's how it's different from a fire department which is sort of
*  lying in wait for a fire to occur well if there was more fires yeah but but
*  just unlikely most of the time I'm just I'm trying I'm trying to distinguish why
*  those why those aren't very comparable things like what why one is more of a
*  public service that that we see to work well while the other wouldn't necessarily
*  and you kind of just said it yourself it would be a signal for there to be more
*  doctors which is why the free market price price points are so important
*  because the only way to signal that is to actually that demand raises prices
*  when the government tries to do that now there's this theory as a socialist that
*  they would say the government can just figure that out I would say that they've
*  tried that in the past it never works it never it just it never ever works the
*  government can't possibly be so omniscient as to know every single price
*  signal and and anticipate every single piece of demand and production that is
*  therefore required and so you know it's not just health care that this is a
*  problem it's it's every aspect of society so if I can go back to what
*  you're saying earlier you so what you're essentially saying about socialism that
*  socialism looks at this problem it says hey let's make the the government take
*  care of everything let's take money from the wealthy people and pour it into the
*  government that the government will then have resources to take care of these
*  issues and you you're just looking at the first step of the problem you're not
*  looking at the secondary or tertiary instances or things that are going to go
*  sideways once you do implement that first step is that what you're saying
*  it's 100% what I'm saying I would I would add the social leaves out some
*  very important things like like human nature for instance and and this this
*  notion that we need incentives socialism doesn't believe in incentives doesn't
*  believe that we need incentive to do things there's there's there's there's
*  this utopian belief among the most the hardcore socialists that that humans
*  will act in this in this kind of philanthropic manner no matter what like
*  we're going to do the most amount of work even if that reward is is
*  overwhelmingly taken away from us and redistributed but of course that's not
*  how it would actually function in reality yeah you would start to you it just
*  wouldn't right and so you're now maybe for a few people a few altruistic
*  people would be the ones you know doing all the work while everybody else is
*  like pretending to work which was what happened in the Soviet Union you pretend
*  to pay us will pretend to work right that was saying from the Soviet Union
*  that's I think we intuitively understand that and and and when that
*  happened again the same thing with Medicare for all if you're if you have
*  price controls your incentives change and if we're if we're not really serious
*  about understanding that aspect of these of these policies then we're not thinking
*  through them correctly and I understand a lot of Democrats would say well it's
*  Medicare for all it's not socialism and I'm like yeah but it but it has very
*  socialistic tendencies and it has these qualities that I've described of not
*  taking into account the second third-order effects of removing human
*  incentive of of forcing somebody's services and because you're calling it
*  a right which means that you now have a right to somebody else's services like
*  these are these are things that have been proven not to work and and I think
*  we and I think we have to understand that as we try to move towards the
*  mutual goal of getting everybody access to health care well it doesn't work with
*  everything but it doesn't that work with the fire department isn't the fire
*  department in a lot of ways a socialist institution no no again I still say it
*  is not because it is not under any obligation to serve everybody that that
*  demands its service right it's there for a specific emergency service as a as a
*  But it's there for fire if there's a fire they they come in and help you
*  there's not a financial incentive for them to do so right but I mean but but
*  on a practical level on a practical level though imagine the scaling that
*  has to occur if you're if you're doing that with medic with medical care and I
*  and I think that's and I think that's the difference with from an economic
*  point and a practical standpoint right but we're talking about over what you're
*  talking about socialism overall not just overall not just involving medicine
*  you're talking about socialism in general and I'm saying isn't the fire
*  department an example of socialism that works well it's definitely not an
*  example of socialism I think it's an example of a public good the way the
*  military is an example of a public good the way the highways are examples of
*  public goods the way parks are examples right but they're funded by the people
*  it's funded by people overall it doesn't cost people money to use them and the
*  people have these as a basic part of our society and our civilization no I
*  understand that and I have nothing no problem with that I just I just would
*  not call them socialist what would you call the fire department how does it get
*  funded it's a public good how does it get funded it's a public good it's
*  funded by the public right and it just it's not it's but it's not relying on
*  these sort of it's not relying on the tenants of socialism to function and so
*  now we're now we're kind of having a discussion of definitions and this is an
*  important discussion to have because oftentimes even Democrats aren't really
*  talking about socialism well even Germany Sanders doesn't call it
*  socialism he's talking about democratic socialism and he makes some very clear
*  distinctions between the two of them which I think you could apply to things
*  like the fire department or the police department yeah there's a lot in that so
*  I think Bernie yes he does say democratic socialism I think he does
*  mean much something much much closer to socialism and that's just me gleaning
*  from his policies because he does talk about putting you know government
*  control on corporate boards Elizabeth Warren talked about the same things now
*  we really are talking about nationalizing things when you're talking
*  about mass price controls across all industries and wage controls you really
*  are talking about more of an actual socialism again going back to the
*  whether a fire department or a park or a public highway or the military is a
*  socialist institution again I would I would I would really push back against
*  that that is a that is a public good we've never in our culture in our
*  economics we've never defined these things as socialist institutions the
*  socialist institution effectively means you're not you're you're seizing the
*  means of production and you're forcing everybody into a centralized planning
*  state you're you're you're telling people what they will earn and what you
*  will pay them how much they can sell you know you start to take more control
*  over the economy a lot of the policy set out by Bernie Sanders are movements in
*  that direction the fire department is is really not that again that is that is a
*  public service it has a defined it has a defined budget it has a defined role it
*  doesn't it doesn't meet any of those other attributes or elements that I that
*  I describe when I describe what a socialist is and so it just gets into
*  another question like what will like maybe Bernie just means the Nordic
*  countries right and you know I remember the foreign minister from Denmark came
*  to Harvard I think he gave a speech as a few years ago and he said stop calling a
*  socialist we're not socialist we're probably and I would agree with them all
*  these Nordic countries have frankly more of a free market than we do in many ways
*  when we look at their regulatory standards they're they're quite liberal
*  when we look at their corporate tax rates it's very low they don't have a
*  minimum wage in many cases and so you know they're not socialist countries
*  what they do have is a very generous welfare state and and that's different
*  than again and even that is different than socialism it's a giant welfare
*  state now I'm still against that many ways I think there's consequences to
*  that giant welfare state that that they now have to suffer with as a result and
*  and if you've noticed too that they did they actually used to be very socialist
*  countries but their economies craster as a result and over time they became much
*  more free market we see the same thing out of Israel we see the same thing out
*  of India used to be much more deeply socialist countries a lot of them have
*  just maintained their big welfare states which they are having trouble paying for
*  just like we're having trouble paying for our big welfare state which is
*  mostly based in Social Security Medicaid and Medicare when you say public good
*  right this is what you feel that the fire department is it's a public good
*  right what do you think that it's possible to implement something like
*  that with in regards to medical care yeah yeah I mean so this is a discussion
*  if we get our definition straight we're just saying okay we just want another
*  public good and it's medical so it's a more accurate way of describing it I
*  think people don't care what's called right we just want health care right but
*  then we get back to the discussion we had before okay what if we did that well
*  there's a cost to it and it's a hell of a lot more than the fire department and
*  police department the cost by by most estimates is in the mid thirty
*  something trillion dollars that's across on for over ten years so about about
*  three and a half trillion per year so that's basically doubling our budget
*  just every year that's in addition to what we already spent okay so that's
*  additional federal spending some some some people try to massage those numbers
*  and say oh but but that's actually cheaper than what we have now if you
*  add it all together that is false that is that is completely false again I have
*  a whole podcast where I actually interviewed the guy who made that study
*  the economist did that study and that's not a controversial study everybody
*  basically agrees Elizabeth Warren's plan was 50 something trillion dollars
*  that's adding what we already spend to the new spending that would have to
*  occur so what does that mean in practice it means doubling or tripling your taxes
*  and let's we try to deficit spend it which I think would be crazy so it means
*  doubling or tripling your taxes and so then and then the question is okay fine
*  well I do want to double or triple my taxes I mean some people will say that I
*  don't actually believe them I bet once they got their taxes they would totally
*  change their mind but let's say they're totally into it okay let's say they
*  actually want to do that then you have the second and third order consequences
*  which is okay what are you getting for this what is what is this new utopia
*  that we really live in where health care is free and then I go back to okay in
*  order to meet that price point of the three and a half trillion a year that's
*  that's by the way assuming that we continue using Medicare prices which is
*  what all the plans do assume by the way so if we're doing that we're drastically
*  cutting prices that we pay doctors and hospitals if we do that we drastically
*  cut our supply of doctors and hospitals and we and we and we cut off and choke
*  off the innovative capacity that we do have so we're losing those quality those
*  quality points again so how do you get people care well the main problem we
*  have with health care in this country is that it costs too much that's
*  fundamentally the problem it is too costly and so from the Republican side
*  what we'd rather do is actually target the source of the problem make it easier
*  to get insurance because right now I mean you know it's for so many Americans
*  that insurance is just too expensive if you have it through your employer it's
*  usually pretty good people are pretty happy with that but for the most part
*  it's too expensive which is why I go back to my direct primary care idea
*  because once you hit once you solve the direct primary the primary care issue
*  you make solving insurance much easier you can tell then you can still protect
*  people for existing conditions we like things like either high-risk pools at
*  the state level or reinsurance programs you can make this you can continue to
*  make improvements to the system that make it affordable for people and get
*  people access that they need while also out of that sorry broke up there for a
*  second this whole connection of doing things remotely sucks what did you can
*  you say that last statement again just the last few words that you said you
*  were talking about insurance here's my question about the whole thing like
*  insurance still has to pay for it then it's you're still paying someone's still
*  paying for all this health care if the insurance companies aren't making any
*  profit because they're paying for all the health care then what happens then
*  do we fund the insurance companies I mean how does all this stuff get evened
*  out are you referring to cases where you know the cost of somebody's care is so
*  astronomically expensive that even the insurance company can't afford it well
*  look here's the problem right people can't afford health care so we get
*  insurance insurance takes care of health care how did the insurance companies
*  make any money then well I mean they make a profit just like just like anybody
*  else but they're also that they're they're also what we found is especially
*  with our experiments with Medicare advantages when you pit insurance
*  companies against each other in a in a free market they lower costs you know
*  they they are a natural there's different there's different elements of
*  the health care system on one side is driving up costs you know because the
*  doctor wants to keep doing more tests or whatever it is or or a patient wants to
*  do more things the insurance company's job is to say hold on a second why are
*  you doing this what is the reason for this what's the outcome that we expect
*  from this so that naturally drives that's that's a natural you know
*  bulwark against higher costs the government with in a Medicare for all
*  scheme the government would simply replace that insurance company we we
*  should be very careful when assuming that the government will somehow be
*  better at that than insurance companies I'm not saying some insurance companies
*  are great at all everybody doesn't seem to like them but I also don't want the
*  government doing it I don't want to be in a case like in Great Britain where
*  where the government will say you know what your granddad's not on the
*  ventilator anymore we're done with that or your baby can't get that care I mean
*  we've all seen these stories and we don't have that issue in America but can
*  I pause you know don't we have a problem with insurance companies not want to pay
*  for certain things they might but they still but the care still happens the
*  hospital has to eat that care a lot and there's there's different funding
*  mechanisms that reimburse them we have a really I'm not defending our health care
*  system I want to be clear about that it's definitely not perfect it's a huge
*  patchwork but no that doesn't that's not the way it happens over there because
*  over there like in Great Britain if you actually nationalize the health care
*  system the way they do it's when they say you're not gonna be on the
*  ventilator anymore there's no choice like that's that that is that is the
*  decision and then that's what they have to deal with and so it's it is different
*  but don't they have some private health care over there as well I think they
*  might have elements of it same with Canada but but but not for basic care
*  like said you can eat for for other kinds of health care surgeries early
*  yeah like elective stuff orthopedic surgeries yeah and I'd have to really
*  get some details for you on what each country does but it's it's it's limited
*  they limit what they can actually do I don't want to get bogged down too much in
*  socialism but one of the things that you said you said socialism has been
*  implemented before but it's never really been implemented here right thank God
*  but this is but this is what I was saying before that I think that when
*  people look at it as an attractive notion one of the things that attracts
*  them to it is that our system doesn't work that great and that maybe this
*  would be a system that does serve people and there's a bunch of buzzwords that
*  people use you know wealth disparity economically disadvantaged you know the
*  working class all these different this is these are words that they use that
*  this is maybe maybe socialism would benefit those people and there's more of
*  them than there are the elite and what do you say to that I would say that
*  there has been times in this country where we had astronomical tax rates and
*  higher government control on some things and we ended up with skyrocketing
*  inflation and downward growth so I'm talking about the 70s and the when
*  Reagan came to power we reversed a lot of that and we've been in a pretty good
*  good trend ever since I I know that what I know what people are saying and you
*  repeated it which is our system doesn't work well I want to I actually want to
*  push back against the premise that our system doesn't work the evidence for
*  that is not great I mean I think there's a lot more evidence to suggest that we
*  live in the best time in modern history in history in modern times it's it's
*  hard it's hard to argue otherwise I would agree there are certain there's I
*  mean there's certain problems that people point to especially Millennials
*  my people my age housing is it is more expensive our purchasing power isn't as
*  good with say things like housing and health care these are true statements
*  also depends on where you live the problem joke is people are identifying
*  issues they're not putting them into context and perspective but even if
*  they're right about the issues like hey our purchasing power is lower with
*  respect to housing and health care two very important things people are
*  misunderstanding why that is people forgot to ask the question why is it why
*  is it that I can't afford this people are instead jumping to a solution that
*  is frankly very shallow and simple which is make housing cheaper make health care
*  cheaper how write a law say it's cheaper well no that's not how it works we can't
*  just do that we have to first ask the question like why did this happen so in
*  California let's talk about housing for a second California and Texas don't have
*  the same problems and housing in Texas is much easier to come by than it is in
*  California why is that well as it turns out we don't have zoning here in Houston
*  you can build where you want to build it's a much easier I talked to
*  developers who develop here and develop sometimes in California it's like four
*  times more expensive to develop because of all the regulations in California
*  which means the housing itself is going to be more expensive so what is it
*  government too much government control frankly in San Francisco you can't build
*  anything else they don't allow building high rises full of apartment building so
*  it's no surprise that supply is too constricted and prices have to go up for
*  the limp to the intense amount of demand that's out there we don't have those
*  same problems in Texas okay so again it's like why is this happening same with
*  healthcare healthcare is not a free market hasn't been and basically forever
*  and prices have gone up as a result now health care is a lot more complicated
*  than housing and we've spent a lot of time talking about it already but we
*  really have to ask ourselves why something is is so expensive what we're
*  getting from that and then and then we intelligently look at what are the
*  solutions to solve it in California is a mess in a lot of ways there's a lot of
*  problems but you really feel like the the reason why San Francisco's housing
*  but it's gone up radically with the tech boom I mean I think a lot of it is
*  supply and demand a lot of is just as I mean but it's also people that just have
*  ridiculous amounts of money and so the wealth in San Francisco is so off the
*  charts that people are willing to buy a stupid house for you know three million
*  dollars that really should be three hundred thousand dollars in Texas yeah
*  no well I agree with you it is a supply and demand issue and the supply hasn't
*  caught up with the demand that's not that's what I'm saying is like the the
*  government won't allow more supply to be built well they're trying not to ruin
*  the city too though yeah and that's fair like that but that but that's a and
*  that's totally fair and as a as a city people in San Francisco might just
*  decide we don't want anybody else living here and we don't want to build anything
*  else but what's weird is they have no problem with homeless people I mean the
*  homeless people. When was the last time you've been to San Francisco? It's been a while but I
*  but I have been there quite a number of times and I was gonna say like I spent
*  ten years in San Diego San Diego doesn't have these problems. Well it's a far more
*  conservative place and they just they let big buildings get built you know like
*  I used to live in downtown San Diego and when I was there it was one way and
*  now there's like 15 more high rises and the rent is basically stayed the same so
*  which is good for renters it's bad for owners and developers but you know the
*  irony is like the populist kind of left and right like are really mad at the
*  owners and developers the owners of capital right like like kind of Marxist
*  screaming and yelling is all about but the irony is that the policies they
*  want to implement help those people and if we let more deregulation occur you're
*  helping the renters whose rent hasn't changed in years and I know this like I
*  follow the market in San Diego very carefully because we still have property
*  there and so I rent out to people I haven't been able to I have not changed
*  the rent in years years and that's because of upward supply and so again so
*  I guess my you're completely right it's a supply-to-money issue in San Francisco
*  the thing is it's like you have to choose one or the other if you want
*  prices to go down you have to allow more supply if you're comfortable with
*  prices the way they are and you don't want more people moving into San
*  Francisco well then fine but you have to be comfortable with the prices the way
*  they are and then deal with the homeless population on top of the homeless
*  population is insane I mean you've never seen anything like it Los Angeles as
*  well go to downtown LA and drive around and it doesn't even seem like it's real
*  it does it seems like it's a movie it's it's it's really sad and there's no
*  solution there's no solution it's on the table there's nothing that anybody's
*  like said that like a this is what we're gonna do this this is our 10-year plan
*  and we're gonna clean this up and we're gonna do X Y & Z and we're gonna take
*  care of this because there didn't used to be 70,000 homeless people in the city
*  and there is now so obviously something went wrong and over a period of 10
*  million years or 10 years rather 70 million people 70,000 people and how many
*  throwing out a bunch of numbers here that don't make sense how many million
*  people live in LA it's like 20 million people and there's 70,000 homeless
*  people right is that something like that that is a crazy number 70,000 is a
*  small it's a good-sized town it is and I wouldn't say there's no solutions
*  although there's no solutions being proposed in California I mean you're
*  correct about that they should propose solutions and they could look to Houston
*  for some ideas what have they done well we we took it seriously one thing we do
*  is a housing first type of policy so you you offer services but after you've
*  gotten them somewhere and maybe that place is a warehouse but you actually
*  you also have to have a forcing function so there's there's also a degree of
*  allowing this what is basically a crime to take place in California whereas in
*  Texas we don't allow it we're saying just camp on the street yeah right it's
*  just you so that's the first thing like you you have to actually make it illegal
*  but then put systems in place to actually help them but it but it does
*  have to go in that order in in California their main problem is that
*  they they allow it and in Austin we have this problem because Austin is a very
*  liberal city and so their instinct was to do the same thing that they're doing
*  in San Francisco and LA the governor stepped in said okay you know what no
*  we're actually just going to solve this we're gonna put everybody somewhere else
*  we're gonna take them away from you know because the people are camping out right
*  outside businesses right and so we took them out and but but made sure that
*  there was some kind of access to hygiene to porta potties and then and then
*  access to you know social services that get you know get people back on their
*  feet there's also a good private like there's a real like nonprofit sector in
*  Houston that works together very well with the city over time a lot of private
*  investors I mean I went and toured this like the shelter it's mostly they try to
*  maintain it mostly for families but this shelter what looks ice man you go
*  into this thing it looks like a like a new college campus how nice it is and
*  this is 95% privately funded they take some HUD money to to fund some of their
*  more longer term like apartments that they have there for people but this is
*  how people get access to new job training you know and so that's it has to be a
*  public-private relationship and you have to have some leadership that says we're
*  just gonna we're actually gonna try and solve this problem is there anything on
*  the table like that for California I don't know man I'm a I'm a Texas guy I
*  there should be I don't know I don't I don't I I could guess but I'd be
*  speaking out of turn I really I don't know what the what the deal is I just
*  know you guys are sheltered in place it's growing like barnacles here it's
*  really strange I mean I've been here since 94 and I've never seen anything
*  like the current situation and like you said it's a crime they're allowing to
*  take place you can't litter so how come you could just leave your shit under the
*  underpass I mean you can't walk under underpasses in a lot of Los Angeles and
*  I mean I'm not exaggerating there's needles and cans and garbage and
*  cardboard and tents and bikes it's nuts I mean it's really really strange almost
*  every underpass in certain parts of LA you'll find homeless encampments yeah I
*  mean it's just it's a stain on what are they doing right now during coronavirus
*  lockdown that's a very good question I don't know is that worse we're locked
*  down so I don't mean I go here I go to the grocery store I go home that's
*  basically all I've been doing for a month and it's most people that are
*  following the regulations it's all they're doing as well so I don't know
*  what they're doing I haven't seen any talk about it I've seen the fact they
*  had to shut down beaches because people were just getting silly and they're
*  using it like a day off and going to the beaches and being on top of each other
*  so they had a shut down parking at the beaches and they've slowly tried to
*  close the loopholes the loopholes for knuckleheads basically yeah is there is
*  there an end date to California's leave they're talking about having it the end
*  of April but I think there was some talk about it now being the end of May I don't
*  find out that out Jamie is there Jamie doesn't have a laptop in front of me
*  because we're doing this I don't know you know I don't I don't I mean I think
*  it's flexible too because if the if the cases keep rising or they they stop
*  falling I mean who knows there's you know health care and this is a health
*  care issue obviously is so complicated and there's so many levels to it but I
*  mean I think one of them that we really have to address is diet and obesity
*  there's there's a giant problem with diet and obesity in this country healthy
*  food eating eating the proper food and you know I had a friend who said they
*  were talking about people who do drugs and people who drink and you know maybe
*  they shouldn't get access to those same health care and maybe that's a good
*  incentive to stop people from drinking and doing drugs and I said yeah what
*  about people who do fat what about people who are fat like you're gonna use
*  the same logic with them because you can't fat shame so can you tell hey hey
*  fatso you can't get the same health care that a healthy person does well if you
*  got a healthy person who likes to drink and they run and they they jog but they
*  occasionally smoke a cigarette what are they healthier than someone who's
*  morbidly obese yes they are so what we have a problem is people who don't self
*  care we have a giant problem with that people who don't take the necessary
*  steps personally now is this because of education is it because of ignorance is
*  it because of an a lack of awareness of the consequences of a non-healthy diet
*  or eating poor foods or consuming large amounts of alcohol or tobacco products I
*  don't know what it is but that is a massive part of our health care system
*  is people who are not doing the proper things to their own body in terms of
*  eating nutritious foods hopefully that they can afford in terms of exercise
*  which is free for everybody you know there's a lot of things you can do that
*  are free to take care of your body yeah I agree well I think it's indicative of
*  a problem in our culture where we've started to sideline this notion of
*  personal responsibility I chapter 7 in my book I forgot I got to talk about my
*  book fortitude available now well now order from your local bookstore did you
*  read they need more help than Amazon did you read the audiobook version of it
*  yeah good thank you 14 hours very important and I enjoyed that some other
*  dork is reading for you I'd be very upset yeah no I was very much against
*  that and so yeah we got it done chapter 7 is called a sense of duty and you know
*  part of the part of the deal when we when we when our founders wrote out the
*  Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and and and built the
*  framework for this free society that we live in where government's role is to
*  protect your rights that's fundamentally the government's role you have God given
*  rights and and these these are life liberty property effectively speaking
*  life liberty and property that's there and the constant in the Declaration they
*  Jefferson wrote the pursuit of happiness and they choose these words really
*  carefully now part of the exchange there is is a necessity for citizens to live
*  with a sense of duty and to live as a citizen that this idea of citizenship and
*  to do what is right to do what is good it's hard for me to imagine that people
*  are just so uneducated that they don't know that they're unhealthy you know I
*  think I think I think they know it right the problem is that they don't care
*  that's a problem and you're getting at that problem I don't know if that's true
*  I don't think it's that they don't care I think they have no discipline I don't
*  think it's that they don't care the difference well there's there's a
*  difference is they've never been taught to push themselves there's a lot of
*  people look it's just so easy to get by but that's one of the reasons why I love
*  the title of your book fortitude is what people need and and also they need to
*  understand that there's a great value in doing difficult things and this society
*  what's it which after is that chapter 8 is it well the name of the chapter is
*  called do something hard good for you well listen man that's true look you're
*  a Navy SEAL man you you know it you get it you live it this is what we need we
*  need more people who understand that I know it's hard to get up I know it's
*  hard to do things I know it it's hard for me too but I still do them and you
*  should do them too I mean it should be something that we encourage everyone to
*  do and that we we all talk about and that we all praise each other for and we
*  all get excited about accomplishing these things and taking care of your
*  physical body taking care of your meat vehicle if everybody just did that we
*  would have health care costs in this country would be radically decreased
*  well that's a fact yeah that's a fact that's an absolute fact if more people
*  had discipline and more people just went out and took care of themselves and then
*  had discipline to not overeat and that discipline to to try to choose the right
*  foods and to make a meal plan write things down I mean it can be done these
*  we're not talking about breathing underwater we're talking about things
*  that can be done by the average person well I don't think the the notion of
*  personal responsibility is talked about enough as it's almost conservatives
*  talk about it all the time it's one of things I appreciate about conservatives
*  but it's it's kind of used against us a lot right it's almost like we're accused
*  of being immoral and unfeeling and uncaring when we say you know in this
*  whole like oh just tell everybody to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
*  and whatever and like not that we even use that term but but the point is is
*  that it's actually important and I don't think conservatives have done a good
*  enough job over time explaining why it's so important and personal
*  responsibility as a as a foundation of our culture it's important because it
*  leads to empowerment it gives us the agency to control our own destiny it's
*  if you're constantly in victimhood if you're constantly being told that that
*  you can't control your own destiny well that's fundamentally disempowering and
*  that's a terrible psychological state to be in and the other thing I tell people
*  is that is a fundamental American attribute there's there's some
*  interesting polling out there I don't know I forget the numbers right but I
*  always I always have them in a speech that I give and when when you ask people
*  what's the exact question it's it's like do you know do you have or do things
*  that happen to you are they within your control or outside your control it's
*  something like that in Germany the the answer was was overwhelmingly things are
*  happening to them outside of their control right like like you understand
*  I'm saying in America when the same question was asked it was like you know
*  30 or 40 percent of people said yes versus in Germany it was like 50 or 60
*  percent so it's a pretty market difference and that's a uniquely
*  American thing that we believe we are in control of our own destiny we tend to
*  overwhelmingly say more than European countries that if we work hard and and
*  and play by the rules and do what's right that we will get ahead that we
*  will find that opportunity and I think that's I think the world recognizes that
*  too when you when you go around the world and you ask people where would you
*  rather be to you know to if you could immigrate right now what's your number
*  one destination well it's the US of a like overwhelmingly the second place is
*  Canada and Germany at like 6% of respondents the USA is like 21% of
*  respondents so second place isn't even close and so for all of the left-wing
*  like anger and always saying how bad it is and how nothing works here and
*  everybody's just in in crisis all the topics that were in a crisis technically
*  right now of course but this this rhetoric was was was prevalent before all
*  this for all of that commentary it's it just it just isn't true and so and then
*  the reason they use crisis language okay the reason they tell you're gonna die in
*  ten years climate change the reason they're always telling you that
*  corporations are taking advantage of you and the 1% has just got you under their
*  all of this it's always it's a very victimizing language and there's a
*  reason behind it because they want very they want very very extreme policies put
*  into place and you can't justify you can't justify revolutionizing the whole
*  system unless you convince people that the system is so bad and so corrupt that
*  it needs to be revolutionized and and what's that's created is a real
*  undermining of this notion of personal responsibility because you have to tell
*  people their victims if you're going to convince them that they need you to save
*  them and when you undermine personal responsibility you disempower people and
*  fundamentally to me that's what socialism does because you're telling
*  people they're you know each to each to their need each to their ability what
*  you're telling people is that they don't have to work that hard that they deserve
*  they have rights to all of these other services from other people it's their
*  right and we should distribute that accordingly everybody's perfectly equal
*  what that does is it removes agency from people and it's truly a disempowering
*  thing and we've seen this throughout throughout history you know just talked
*  to Venezuelans and Cubans and they're so happy when they get here they're so
*  happy because they just want to work hard and move up and they're just so
*  excited about this meritocracy that we've that we've that we've built into
*  our into our culture
*  well Cubans are such a great example that my friend Andrew Schultz who's a
*  hilarious comedian has a great bit about how communist Cubans come to America and
*  the moment they step foot on soil they become Republicans it's really hilarious
*  and it's true
*  yeah and they do appreciate that that aspect of this country I think one of
*  things that you said earlier is that we live in the best time ever in history
*  and I agree with that the consequences of it being such a great time are it's
*  far easier to get by because it's far easier to get by people look for things
*  to be more difficult than they actually are they look for things to be more
*  stacked against them than they actually are they look for more of a woe is me
*  standpoint when you find people that actually have a real difficult life they
*  don't look for things to be hard they find hard things everywhere they look and
*  oftentimes you find that those people that have a real struggle that it's
*  there's a great documentary called happy people by Werner Herzog it's about
*  people who live in Siberia and it is a brutal difficult existence in extreme
*  cold but these people are overwhelmingly happy
*  I mean it is a really crazy documentary because their physical and their
*  struggle just for existence just to survive is so difficult that they've
*  found this sort of perfect vibration of existence where they're in the
*  wilderness they're out there trapping and hunting and fishing and and farming
*  and and gathering up enough food to survive in the extreme winters and it's
*  it really shows you that human beings need difficult tasks we need things to
*  be tough to do and we need to actually go out there and do them to have a
*  feeling of satisfaction and have a feeling of personal responsibility and
*  the fact that you've actually done the things that you needed to do in order to
*  survive it's built into us yeah it really is this is why I wrote a whole
*  chapter on this do something hard is it is it is a real deep dive into the
*  benefits of suffering yes and and I distinguish between just going through
*  something hard like getting blown up in the face like yeah that's suffering but
*  it's not self-imposed I wouldn't wish that upon anybody I'm not saying you
*  need to get blown up in the face and lose an eye to have this sort of
*  spiritual awakening and how good it feels to go through something hard but
*  you should you should habitually move into a self-imposed suffering you were
*  about to say something no I wasn't no okay but you but you just by virtue like
*  you're a seal and seals people that are special operators people that have gone
*  through just whether it's military or first responders really difficult
*  physical tasks to get to where you you are just that alone creates character
*  creates a different kind of person and the type of people that gravitate
*  towards those endeavors those there's just their special people they are but
*  you know I didn't write this book for them and I wrote it for everybody and
*  what I point out is listen seals have our hard thing and it's buds you know
*  which is an acronym it stands for basic underwater demolition slash seal
*  training it's six months of hell and it it is it pushes you beyond limits you
*  you ever thought you had hell week especially and when you're done with
*  that when you when you come away from hell week there really is this sort of
*  spiritual awakening it's that you have higher confidence you feel prepared for
*  anything even in the some of the worst situations you can think to yourself
*  well it's not quite hell week is it you know and so you you're able to have a
*  much more perspective we're lacking in perspective quite a bit also chapter 2
*  is called perspective from darkness and I point this fact out that too many of us
*  have have gotten so comfortable we've removed suffering from our life to such
*  an extraordinary degree and that's not a bad thing okay that's that's that's an
*  that's an element of the modern times that we live in and I'm happy we live
*  there but the reality is is that my ancestors were like struggling through
*  Texas trying to find water on a daily basis and and in my life I'm complaining
*  because when I'm at 30,000 feet flying through the air the Wi-Fi isn't as fast
*  as I'd like it to be like so we have very different complaints and it's good
*  to every once in a while just think you know what I have it pretty damn good and
*  to remind yourself of that again the do something hard chapter is it's one it's
*  a deep dive into the psychological literature which I just enjoy doing
*  there's a there's a lot to back this up whether it's modern psychology the
*  history of stoicism or or the Bible we all of these all of these texts these
*  these these ancient pieces of wisdom that have been around for a very long
*  time they all talk about this they'll talk about the value of suffering the
*  value of enduring and hardship and how this builds character and and how this
*  actually quite literally makes you stronger and both the both a
*  metaphysical sense and a psychological sense and a physical sense actually
*  actually going to the to the science of it as well and like how the the changes
*  in your brain what exercise does what hardship actually does both physically
*  and metaphysically like there's real there's real benefits to this but you
*  do it and it doesn't have to be Joe Rogan's life okay I wonder if a lot of
*  people look at your life and they're like that guy is too productive for me
*  and you know that it's just too intimidating and maybe that's so but
*  don't compare yourself to other people compare compare yourself to who you were
*  yesterday you know I think that was it's not a Jordan Peterson that might be a
*  Jordan Peterson I think I just quoted that but but but the point is is like
*  these things are true because they're true like that's why Jordan Peterson
*  says that because it's true like you know I don't pretend like I'm the first
*  one to come up with these ideas I'm just trying to put them into language that
*  people can understand and and use my life experiences to bolster those those
*  lessons but it just has to be harder than what you did yesterday and maybe
*  it's physical but not everybody can do physical things maybe it's hard for you
*  to finish a project at home just do that maybe take a cold shower and just so you
*  can like kind of you feel tougher the rest of the day because you're like you
*  know what I just sat in ten minutes of icy cold water I didn't do that the day
*  before but I did it today and now I feel a little bit more like a badass like you
*  know and I feel like more like a badass than I did yesterday it's small things
*  it's the self-imposed suffering is so important for our lives like me I for me
*  it's usually physical right like I want to do this challenge of a workout you
*  know like that kind of keeps me sharp or maybe it's like running for Congress or
*  something like I don't know like we all have something and I'm just saying you
*  have to find that and make it habitual it can't just be once either because
*  seals can get soft too yes we all know that you know we know who those guys are
*  and it's because they stopped they stopped listening from to the lessons
*  from buds into this this value of self-imposed suffering I feel that
*  resilience is almost like a muscle it's something that you can build and it's
*  also something they can get soft and I think that I look I love comfort don't
*  get me wrong but I don't appreciate it unless I've done something difficult you
*  know if you look at like all the different things I do and say all you
*  real productive and that's nice dude I also like to watch TV I like to put my
*  feet up I like to kick back like to have beer I like to relax but I don't like to
*  relax if I'm not doing shit I know me and I get mad at me if I'm not doing
*  anything I don't like me when I'm not productive but when I am productive I
*  also can enjoy to relax I enjoy relaxation and I don't enjoy it unless
*  I've earned it and I think that's what people need to do they need to earn
*  their comfort you have a proper sense of shame which is what you're describing
*  that's chapter six it's called the right you're describing this stuff because you
*  already know this like it you read my book like you'll be like I already know
*  all this but because it's true all right now I'm trying to give these lessons out
*  in a clear and coherent kind of fun way but these things are just true you feel
*  bad when you don't act the way you envision yourself to be like you you
*  have this hero archetype and I talked about here archetypes before you have
*  this idea of like what you think is the right way to be and you're trying to
*  live up to that at all times we often fail and you've built that archetype
*  over time maybe looking to others is like the right kind of hero maybe you've
*  seen how how successful people are and you're like I want to be like that I'm
*  sure you maybe you do it in comedy or fighting or whatever it is like you're
*  like they have a way of doing something that maybe I should mimic and so you've
*  built this over time and you know when you you know only you know really when
*  you when you don't meet that standard when you don't meet that standard there
*  should be a degree of shame that you feel and and I and I again this is a
*  problem I viewed in society where I don't know that people are feeling that
*  shame anymore it's almost the opposite and when you when you don't feel that
*  shame you can't feel a sense of duty to be that citizen that we talked about
*  earlier and I find this to be a big problem even with the small stuff like
*  and I use examples in the book like you should feel shame when you're that
*  person who doesn't put the shopping cart in the little shopping cart section
*  parking lot and leaves it in the parking space absolutely no it's easy and you're
*  like somebody will do it there's people there people who take care of this well
*  but like why why don't you just why don't you just put it away and worse
*  like and if you don't put it away because you're in a rush you know
*  because your kid is screaming and maybe you have a good reason not to put it
*  away but the question to ask yourself is did you feel bad about it right did you
*  feel bad about it and if you didn't feel bad about it what the hell is wrong with
*  you yes these are very simple lessons like we have to start small have to
*  start small the shopping cart one is a great example that's such a good one
*  such a classic it's so good just makes you mad that's like I've found the
*  greatest parking spot and then that damn carts like right so easy to do just just
*  put it back bitch just walk it over there put it in the little stall and you
*  feel better you like look I did it I you know what I do I bring it all the way
*  the fuck back to the supermarket I put it back in the thing right in front yes
*  I don't even put it in the stall I walk those extra steps and it doesn't take
*  much time but I feel like I did something even if it's just a trick the
*  grocery store doesn't even have to put those little sections out in the parking
*  lot they could just tell you to put it walk it all the way back walk it back
*  bitch but the reason why I like the little stalls is because of people that
*  do have kids if there's a mom and she's got a baby with her great great give her
*  an out a way out or hire some kid to gather those things up while people are
*  walking out with them fine but you know if you're just a guy and you you know
*  you're shopping for yourself and you don't put your cart back fuck you you
*  know and that sense of shame that you're talking about that that really is
*  important people need to feel shame if you've come up short like that because
*  you can do better you can do better and you should want to do better the way to
*  get back the way to get ahead in life is to do everything that way the way you do
*  everything is the way you do anything the way you do anything is the way you
*  do everything I mean that's really what it is if you just do the right thing do
*  it the way you're supposed to do it you can do it and you'll feel better if
*  you're supposed to get a workout in today like oh fuck I'd rather just sleep
*  in no just fucking get your ass up and do it and you'll feel better when it's
*  done you're like damn I did it I can do this tomorrow too you can and it's
*  momentum and just developing that momentum it's a skill it's like
*  everything else it's like learning how to be polite it's like learning how to
*  be cordial learning how to be a nice person these are learned things you
*  can't just accept that you're a piece of shit and this is just the way you are
*  no just look at yourself as if you were another person judging you like as if
*  you are a person who's like a life coach judging you what would you tell you to
*  do that's exactly right and the reason I reason I wrote about this was because
*  you know throughout this book I'm identifying a problem and then trying to
*  come up with a solution so the solution is effectively saying what you're saying
*  and I write a lot about it or about the psychology behind it but the problem is
*  is like we I feel like we've removed shame in our culture to a huge extent to
*  where towards almost celebrated to you know to like do these wrong things we've
*  started to change the definition of what's right and wrong this sort of kind
*  of post-postmodern society and we think with some examples of what I mean by
*  that well in one part I do bring up the example of how we view you know
*  assistance like government assistance and there's the movie Cinderella man
*  where Russell Crowe plays the whatever the name is the boxer yeah that's it and
*  you know he gets a welfare check to beginning of the movie by the end of the
*  movies pulled himself back up and he returns it and that's sort of like our
*  classic heroic thing to do like you know what like we believe in helping people
*  who need it but we also believe that you shouldn't take it if you don't need it
*  it seems like a pretty good good piece of you know civic duty to live by and
*  and then I went to my own experience leaving the Navy where we were actually
*  encouraged to get on Social Security disability insurance as I was leaving
*  the Navy and so I was in a classroom full of fellow Navy service members none
*  of which were SEALs none of which had been in combat none of which appeared
*  injured in any way I was the only one with like a visible injury where it's
*  obvious as to why I'm being medically retired and so we're all getting
*  medically retired and by nature of getting medically retired from the
*  military it's guaranteed that we have some kind of benefit on the back end of
*  that and I what I would call a very generous benefit you know people would
*  disagree with me on that but I think it's a I think we get a generous benefit
*  and to on to say on top of that that we should also take money out of the Social
*  Security Trust Fund for disability insurance even though every single
*  person in there walked right out of that classroom is perfectly capable of
*  working was so frightening to me that it would that it is so ingrained in our
*  new culture that it was actually in the curriculum at a government classroom and
*  in this kind of stuff is cheered on and I see this a lot people will tell a
*  story of victimhood and be cheered but we're not supposed to cheer for that we
*  might feel compassion for them but to cheer for them and this and this
*  explains why we're seeing these sort of hoaxes that we've seen like why did
*  Jussie Smollett feel that he had to say that to MAGA guys in Chicago beat him up
*  like why did what was we we didn't ask enough what the underlying psychology
*  behind that was like why do that and I think the reason is because we started
*  to elevate victimhood we started to elevate this sort of shameful behavior
*  and this is what I mean by we sort of changed the definitions of what it even
*  means to feel ashamed and what it means to feel like you're doing the wrong
*  thing because we've changed the definitions of right and wrong and I
*  and I see a need to get us back to some traditional definitions before we all
*  just lose our freaking minds yeah I think that's that's a very good point I
*  think what you're saying is absolutely correct I think victimhood should be
*  look if you are an actual victim I mean I feel for you it's terrible but if
*  you're not a victim and you're playing up victimhood it's disgusting it's one
*  of the grossest things that you see in our culture especially when we're
*  talking about how easy society is and now when you have a person who is
*  affluent and successful and famous like Jussie Smollett who does that and you
*  like Jesus Christ man like boy did you miss the point that's why it's so foul
*  for us when we see someone who's just trying to for their own personal
*  gain they're trying to game the system and make it out like they're a victim
*  it's one of the grossest things that you could see in a successful culture I mean
*  there's people out there that really are injured like yourself from combat there's
*  people out there that really are sick there's people out there that are really
*  victimized by violent crime and to fake it it's such a it's such a disgusting
*  insult to people that actually are injured yeah and that's that's like the
*  most extreme I think that's the extreme consequence of this victimhood culture
*  because there's definitely difference between real victims and victimhood
*  culture you have to distinguish between those two things and we have to respect
*  somebody who's actually a victim yes you know in my case in the disability
*  insurance thing like I didn't take it but what concerns me is that if I had
*  and if I had gone on and said and sort of proudly exclaimed that I got this and I
*  needed it like shouldn't somebody call me out for that you know and the reality
*  is is that I don't think people would I don't think I would be called out for
*  that even though I'm a perfectly capable of work yes I'm kind of blind and like I
*  can't see even out of my good eye but I can work I mean I've shown that I can
*  work why would I take that that wouldn't be just that would I think that would go
*  against our classical definition of what is fair and just and yet in our
*  current culture I do I don't believe that anybody would call me out for that
*  and I should be called out if I had taken that money I really believe that
*  just because I was already getting benefits right I'm not saying it
*  shouldn't get anything I was blown up and then had to get out of the Navy as a
*  result but but I but I feel our culture is a little bit backwards on this and it
*  worries me a great deal we've changed we've changed a few definitions like
*  what it means to be a victim I think we've changed that definition
*  overwhelmingly and we've changed the definition of justice also and in
*  injustice and what an injustice actually is we've forgotten how to we've forgotten
*  how to distinguish between discrimination and disparities like just
*  because you don't have the same thing does that effectively mean there was
*  some injustice that occurred there we're not asking those analytical questions
*  and I think that's a real problem and it's it's made debate very difficult
*  it's it's made debate with my colleagues in the Democratic Party very difficult
*  because every disparity is assumed to be originating from some kind of injustice
*  you know every time somebody is welter than somebody else the assumption
*  nowadays is that well it's ill-begotten money and that there's some kind of
*  injustice that occurred you know when we were when we were voting on this giant
*  stimulus package not really stimulus package more of a rescue package
*  remember how this happened there was you know we were negotiating through this
*  thing it was actually looking pretty good Nancy Pelosi comes in says hell no
*  we're blowing up the whole thing and we're gonna protect workers and damn you
*  know not these damn corporations okay so you know you fast forward a few days
*  ended up passing basically the same bill anyway that's a long story I'd happy to
*  go into the details of that politically if you'd like me to but the point is
*  this there was this outrage from the populist right and the populist left
*  against anything that had the name corporation attached to it and we've
*  forgotten how to ask ourselves like why is that did they do something evil what
*  what exactly is evil about these entities you know they employ lots of
*  people they create lots of wealth in this particular case we're not being
*  bailed out they didn't do anything wrong but we're really mad at them for some
*  reason we really hate them because there's a sort of cultural movement
*  towards towards feeling that anytime something is successful like our
*  reaction should be to punish it and that that cultural movement worries me a great
*  deal it worries me a great deal that's I think that's what leads to these sort of
*  topics of socialism well I think that that is one of the bad aspects of the
*  ideals of socialism is this inclination to think that when there is an
*  inequality that then inequality is because of either corrupt corruption or
*  greed there's also inequality of effort people do not put in the same effort and
*  when you put in more effort you're more focused you're more disciplined you do
*  more work you should be rewarded and there's people that don't like that idea
*  and they don't like that idea because they're fucking lazy and they're weak
*  and that's a fact and there's people in this world that are weak and there's
*  it's it's an unpopular thing to say because we want to say that no they're
*  economically disenfranchised and there some people are yes some people are and
*  there's also some people that work like a motherfucker and those people get by
*  and they get ahead and those people should be rewarded for their effort one
*  of the problems that I have with people that espouse socialist ideals is that
*  they don't want this competition aspect of our culture in our society to exist
*  where you put in more work you get more reward that's my whole life that is my
*  whole life I mean that every everything that I've ever done I've realized oh all
*  you have to do is work harder than everybody else all you have to do is put
*  in more time all you have to do is be more obsessed more focused and you can
*  get by you can get ahead well the people that don't like that are the people that
*  don't like competition they don't understand it it makes you feel bad when
*  you lose everyone should get a trophy everyone should get a participation
*  trophy that is a giant problem with our culture and this inequality yeah there
*  is income inequality some of it is corruption some of it is bad some of it
*  is inequality of effort and that needs to be addressed as well and it's not you
*  can't have this blanket thing that all the people that run corporations are
*  greedy and all the money that they have acquired is because of ill-gotten gains
*  it's just not true it's not true and it's anti-american frankly yeah I I
*  list a few tenets of a culture that make it a sustainable successful culture the
*  first one is personal responsibility I wanted to detail on that the second one
*  is mental toughness which I wrote a whole book about so and it's important
*  you said it exactly how I describe it when I give speeches on this which is we
*  need mental toughness because otherwise how do we survive in a free society
*  where we have to compete because the only alternative to a bunch of mentally
*  weak people is that we do live in a society where competition is not
*  necessary because the government will just give you everything but I don't
*  want to live in that society and frankly that society can't function very well
*  because nobody would actually do anything and you have to be mentally
*  tough to deal with that and I think the American spirit and the American our
*  history as a culture is a really really tough bunch of people and I just want to
*  remind people of that and I want to remind people that it's something to
*  aspire to like this is a good thing like it's cool to be tougher it's not cool to
*  be a victim right but we have so many like postmodernists who actually again
*  it's going back to this victimhood culture they want you to be that victim
*  and then they'll celebrate you for it yes people tell their victimhood stories
*  they're cheered but it's like wait a second where's the where's the part
*  where you overcame it I thought that was the story we're supposed to cheer well
*  they also you know connect they also connect competition with cruelty and I
*  think that's that's foolish as well yeah it feels bad to lose but that's just
*  because it feels great to win there's it's a it's a peak in a valley thing
*  and you have to understand that and look every competition that I've ever had
*  and the anything that where I've ever competed and lost it has fueled me
*  beyond measure it is what gets you by it's what makes you better there I mean
*  one of the reasons why I understand this is because of martial arts in martial
*  arts you have to train with the best people you can and it's it fucking sucks
*  you get your ass kicked it's part of the but that's what makes you better you need
*  those people you love those people they become your brothers it's very very very
*  important the bonds that are formed in jujitsu gyms and kickboxing gyms and
*  martial arts gyms with the people that you train the men and women that you
*  train with this is an intensity to those bonds that's almost indescribable to
*  anybody that hasn't experienced it I mean I'm sure it's not as as tight as
*  people that have gone through combat together but there's something there's
*  something in those people they they fuel you they help you and they help you by
*  trying to kick your ass they help you by trying to be better than you they help
*  you by trying to be the man they they want to be the best they can be and you
*  think about those motherfuckers when you go to the gym you go goddamn it Mike is
*  here shit and you you get fired up for that person that you know is gonna kick
*  your ass and they provide you with fuel people that are better than you provide
*  you with fuel competition provides you with fuel it doesn't mean you have to be
*  mean it doesn't mean it's cruel it doesn't mean it's insensitive it doesn't
*  mean that it just means that competition is good competition is good
*  for you it's good it shows you your better abilities it shows you that you
*  you can aspire to greatness you can aspire to be better than you are you can
*  do this and you can do this by looking at people who also do it they are your
*  fuel inspiration is fuel nobody gets inspired by Jesse Smollett putting a
*  fucking fake noose around his neck and walking into a hotel still holding a
*  subway sandwich nobody's inspired by that maybe you're inspired to never be
*  that guy and that but it's a weak inspiration you're inspired by greatness
*  you're inspired by great people's stories great people's autobiographies
*  and documentaries and stories of them putting in that work you know I mean
*  that that's why there's so many people that you know their their Instagram
*  existence is essentially just all they doing is just providing inspiration to
*  people like David Goggins that fucking guy every day I mean that guy's fueling
*  millions of people just by being a badass just doing just life is hard
*  motherfucker stay hard and just getting out running every day just by doing that
*  okay I don't know him who is who is filming these videos like his wife she
*  run is she's in a car or something she's in a car no but there's been other
*  instances where he's like climbing a mountain I don't know it's a very it's a
*  maybe she has a stabilizer I guess oh yeah there's been some instances where
*  I'm like okay this seems like a car but this seems impossible to film and
*  without like some some better equipment than just like a selfie video you know
*  well he's got a lot of money I mean he sold the shit out of that book so it's a
*  fantastic book and I can't recommend it enough and you can't hurt me it's called
*  and the audio version is even better because the audio version he actually
*  gets somebody else to read it but then he comes in between and discusses each
*  and every chapter so it's like the audiobook and a podcast together you
*  know he lives an incredible life and he's that guy is an amazing source of
*  fuel for people but is an amazing source of fuel because of his own
*  competition with himself and he's a guy that's talked really openly about being
*  weak at certain points in his life and being fat and lazy and that he got
*  through that he's he hasn't he wasn't born this fucking warrior that came out
*  of the womb running a hundred miles he became that person he became that person
*  from being a slob and he's real open about it and he's even open about his
*  own weakness currently he's like sometimes I'll stare at my fucking shoes
*  for a half hour before I run my shit I don't want to do this fuck but then
*  he'll go out and do it and while he's doing it he'll yell you know like that
*  people like that are fuel and there's certain people that don't like people
*  like that because they make them feel bad they look at themselves they go god
*  damn it I don't work as hard as that guy I don't have that kind of mental
*  toughness and then they'll try to find something wrong with it but it's it's
*  because they're they're not willing to look at themselves objectively they're
*  not willing to try to be the best person that they can be yeah I agree with that
*  I want to introduce you to him yeah yeah where does he live he's in Vegas now
*  Vegas yeah when do you guys um you want to bring it back to coronavirus I've
*  got some I would love to because this is I mean I think there's the thing I
*  wanted to maybe discuss is is the balance that that needs to be talked
*  about and we this is where I would have taken the conversation from earlier
*  about the media what how do you feel about Sweden the way Sweden's handling
*  it because we're talking about balance Sweden has got a very different approach
*  to it their approach is essentially listen old people vulnerable people
*  please take care of yourself stay home they'll provide assistance they'll get
*  you food they'll do whatever they can they get to you but people that are
*  healthy they want them to go out and live their lives they don't want the
*  restaurants to shut down the pubs to shut down this is a disease that you know
*  it's ravaged people of all nationalities and all age and demographic groups but
*  their their ideas take care of your health be careful but let's get society
*  back on its feet again and they're widely criticized by that I would love
*  to hear what you think well I think the jury's still out on whether that's a
*  There's three different strategies okay and there's a Harvard White Paper that
*  that delineates these pretty well I spoke with one of the professors from
*  the Center of Ethics that that was an author of this and you can describe
*  these three strategies in the following way one they call freeze-in-place which
*  is basically what we're doing right now it's what most countries are doing a
*  hardcore quarantine of course that's different depending on what part of the
*  country you're in the second well let me jump to the third one the third one
*  would just be surrender okay let it happen we'll deal with it as we go but
*  we're not keeping anybody at home that's effectively what Sweden is doing the
*  second option would be sort of a mix of the two which I think will end up being
*  the American option or it better well should be where we have a defined period
*  where we remain in place but then we we confront the enemy and like I said we're
*  in a tactical retreat right now but a certain point we actually have to come
*  back out swinging and we need to be prepared to do it Sweden took on the
*  third approach which is like basically they they think they can deal with it
*  and we're gonna see now their cases are jumping up pretty dramatically I don't
*  know how much they'll continue jumping up the Swedes are also very good at
*  culturally following the rules you know like Americans don't like a lot of rules
*  so it's sweet the Swedes will will stop at a red light at 2 a.m. even though
*  there's like nobody around okay same with people in Switzerland okay this is
*  this is we have deeper cultural differences I think their social
*  cohesion and their ability to follow rules like the Koreans is different than
*  our culture where we are we are just way more individualistic and we're gonna do
*  whatever the hell we want we want a flamethrower in our office we're gonna
*  have a flamethrower in our office and like don't tell me I can't have it right
*  I mean you can relate to that I have a flame right behind me
*  I don't have a flamethrower but I have a lot of guns and they're better I'm not
*  they're better having yeah it depends on the situation no they're always better
*  unless you want to start a fire well that's what I mean that's the only
*  situation sometimes the situation is unless you're in the movie alien yeah
*  the point is is you need a diversity of weaponry that's that's that's the truth
*  right and so and so okay so those are three options I think the jury's still
*  out on what if it works for Sweden or not I think it can work and I would like
*  to see us move to that rather quickly now we need to be careful about how we
*  do it but I'm very I'm very concerned about these indefinite extension of the
*  timelines of stay in place I think I think we have to start having reasonable
*  conversations about the costs of that and the costs are a lot more than just
*  dollar signs the costs are held a lot more than just people's 401k is tanking
*  the costs are actually people's lives also whether it's mental health or
*  suicides or divorces or putting off all of these all of these procedures that
*  we're just putting a freeze on so like it's and I have a lot of problem with
*  this I mean in places like Houston our hospitals are not overwhelmed or like
*  50% capacity still because we're not getting that many more cases but why
*  do you think that is why do you think Texas is less prone to this well I guess
*  I'll answer that question by stating why I think New York is the way it is and
*  and New Orleans is the way it is New York is the way it is because it's a
*  it's a giant city with enormous density the most it's the densest city in the
*  country by far it's also the most likely place that a lot of international
*  travelers were coming in and out of and so I think it's safe to say there was
*  multiple hot spots that occurred within New York City and then it spread wildly
*  because people ride subways and elevators I mean it's not like Los
*  Angeles it's not like Houston where we take a car everywhere no matter what
*  there's natural social distancing that already occurs in New Orleans well they
*  had Mardi Gras I mean there's explanations behind these things and I
*  do worry sometimes that our modeling is using these numbers in the wrong ways
*  and not taking enough into the account into the fact that we just we have very
*  different lifestyles in different parts of the country and also take into
*  account that we can target certain solutions and so regarding that Harvard
*  white paper that says the second solution is mobilized in transition once
*  you've slowed the spread by doing what we're doing again I'm not against doing
*  what we're doing I just think we need to stick to the timelines and maybe make
*  those timelines sooner than later and then come out and fight and what does
*  fighting mean well while we're in waits we're basically we're ramping up
*  production of protective gear we're ramping up production of ventilators
*  again our system is amazing we are producing we're gonna be producing by
*  I think next week or so up to 7,000 new ventilators a week we haven't run out of
*  ventilators I went through the numbers before we're talking about socialized
*  medicine like one of the benefits of our system is we are actually way better
*  prepared than people realize now we have a big lack of PPE there's a lot of
*  reasons for that and I can go into one reason is that China was stopping export
*  from 3m from going to China to the rest of the world back in January and
*  February right this was just came out and in an article that was written it
*  was confirmed by you know 3m a lot of people in government they were
*  preventing the export because 3m produces a lot of it in China they're
*  preventing those exports because they wanted to hoard the supplies then they
*  act like the good guy and go around the world giving it out I mean China has to
*  is we're gonna have to really look at our supply chains and our relationship
*  with China after this but that's one of the reasons we didn't have the proper
*  amount of PPE it also depends on the hospital again like there is some
*  accountability that has to take place with specific hospitals and specific
*  cities and why they didn't prepare I've what I've noticed as of late is this
*  strange belief that the president is everybody's micromanaging boss and that's
*  just not how our system works nor should it and there has to be some level of
*  accountability at the local and state level too again I just got the phone
*  with some of the doctors here at the Texas Medical Center and I'm like how are
*  you guys on PPE and they're like we have so much PPE because we're used to
*  disasters here and we prepare and so they're just not worried about it we've
*  supplied it set up the supply chains in advance like there has to be we have to
*  work together there's what I've noticed in all the finger pointing and a lot of
*  it's just political opportunism I don't know if you if you like if you if you
*  put these people up to a lie detector test I wonder if they really think it
*  would be the president's fault that this happened like I don't I don't think they
*  could pass a lie detector test you know I think it's I think it's a lot of
*  political theatrics but in any case it's it gets us away from the right way
*  to look at our system which is local and state government are our managers they
*  manage on those smaller levels like if California wants to try a single-payer
*  health care system let's see it work in California or a smaller state and then
*  let's then let's scale it hell let's let's see if it works in a city and
*  then let's scale it you know like there's a reason federalism is the way it is and
*  it's hard to compare us to different countries in so many ways because these
*  countries are like the size of our city you know like LA is bigger than most so
*  many countries like it's it's it's a matter the scale matters to a huge
*  extent and it's like socialism works if you've got maybe like 50 or 60 people
*  because you can hold each other accountable there's a little bit easier
*  as you scale it out you just can't right that's like co-ops exists and you
*  know in this country like Bernie Sanders lip-bog one you can make it work if you
*  can literally see everybody all the time a family unit is a socialist unit to
*  each their own to each their needs each their ability when you scale things out
*  it dramatically changes things and we have to remember that as it pertains to
*  dealing with the pandemic and dealing with public policy as well the point I
*  was making about the media a second ago one of the problems it's not just that
*  they're not informing people correctly which we discussed earlier the other
*  problem is that they're preventing us from having the right discussions
*  because we do have to have this discussion that we're talking about right
*  now which is how do we how do we responsibly move into a into a system
*  where we're simultaneously combating the pandemic but also reopening our economy
*  and we have to have that and and the natural reaction from disingenuous
*  people is oh well how many lives is it worth to save a job and I'm like okay
*  that's that's not the right question it's a very dishonest question and you
*  know first of all it assumes that somebody going back to work will
*  actually cost a life you can't prove that I mean if we're gonna if we're gonna
*  play this dishonest game of counterfactuals but also it misses the
*  point you know we live in a world where we take risks and and we have to take
*  those risks and then mitigate those risks accordingly and we can better
*  mitigate risk and we better understand what we're dealing with and when we're
*  better prepared and those are the two things we have to do over the next month
*  is get better prepared and that's and that the answer there is test more
*  people especially test people with antibodies so that we can see who's
*  actually immune and we can give them like a certificate or something and do
*  go do whatever they want getting more ICU beds where they might be needed
*  getting more ventilators getting more PPE so that's preparedness side and on
*  the other side we risk mitigate it's just like you know like you explained in
*  Sweden let's keep sick and vulnerable people away let's target our efforts a
*  little bit better let's take a more vertical approach as opposed to a
*  horizontal approach we can do this we can do this if we give each other the
*  grace and the space to do it instead of like this bad-faith finger pointing of
*  like oh you're just gonna kill people you don't even care well it's like
*  that's that's a terrible way to think about it I mean I could moralize this
*  situation say well I could I'll save 30,000 lives this year because I'm not
*  gonna let anybody drive and I am a better person than you because you have
*  the blood of 30,000 people on your hands because you want people driving that's a
*  great example that is a great example I'm the more yeah and that's it's not
*  it's not at all no you're absolutely right and I'm worried about that when we
*  do go back I'm worried about that finger pointing I really am because I think
*  it's just gonna muddy the waters and I'm also worried about it being used as
*  political opportunism and it's gonna scare people already yes it's already
*  happening I have a bunch of quotes I could read you please read some okay
*  because I wrote an op-ed on this it hasn't been published yet but um you know
*  I note some of them there but I will Nancy Pelosi last week said you know the
*  responsible for the deaths of people the where is it it's this is what I said
*  maybe I won't because then I have to actually look for it here I wrote all
*  this stuff down but there's a lot of quotes out there from media and from
*  okay from from pundits from Twitter users but I only quote people who are
*  well-known either they're well-known journalists or their politicians but it
*  usually goes along the lines of exactly what you just said you were worried
*  about which is Trump is more concerned about the the stock market than people's
*  lives all right that's kind of the typical one you hear and no it's
*  certainly been been said quite a bit and my my my fear is that it continues to be
*  said okay I you know and it prevents us from having a reasonable debate because
*  we we truly need to have that reasonable debate the other the other
*  thing that frustrates me about these kind of bad faith arguments is that the
*  people saying them made the same claims themselves like February 1st Washington
*  Post here's a headline get a grip America the flu is a much bigger threat
*  than the coronavirus okay February 1st USA Today coronavirus is scary but the
*  flu is deadlier and more widespread okay February 3rd Washington Post why we
*  should be wary of an aggressive government response to coronavirus and
*  so these same papers are now destroying the president all you didn't act early
*  enough you didn't do anything it's you have the blood you have blood of people
*  on your hands but like that's amazing is yeah the hypocrisy is insane and like
*  I have so many more February 2nd. Go ahead New York Times. Who says it's not safe to
*  travel to China so this is following President Trump's extremely at the time a
*  very bold move to restrict travel from China and you know and of course all of
*  these papers and prominent people are now saying something different I go
*  through a timeline too where I look at because again my my Democrat colleagues
*  are very quick to continue to accuse this administration of just dropping the
*  ball doing all these bad things but I have to remind everybody how this is
*  this is a good one on the same day that that Trump implemented the restriction
*  on travel this was January 27th okay and then they announced the they
*  announced the the ban on travel as well as the task force January 31st oh sorry
*  the 30th the 31st the Trump administration implemented the
*  restriction on travel January 31st and also declared it a public health
*  emergency on that same day Nancy Pelosi talked about a bill promoted a bill
*  called the no ban act which would limit the president's ability to impose travel
*  restrictions so like you just you just can't say you just can't say that this
*  guy wasn't acting in the public's best interest and then then have facts like
*  this when I do remember this too and I pointed this out at the time because you
*  know a lot of people were not talking about coronavirus in February and on
*  February 28th which is a few days before February 28th the the Trump admit the
*  24th the Trump administration asked for two and a half billion dollars from
*  Congress to combat the spread so that was a money that had already been spent
*  by HHS by CDC that needed to be reimbursed so the Trump administration
*  has already been dealing with this and they're like hey Congress we need more
*  money we need more supplemental funding he got slammed I don't know if everybody
*  remembers this but he got destroyed he got told he wasn't taking it seriously
*  why isn't he asking for more money the president's response to that was okay
*  fine give me more money like I'm just just write something that that week you
*  know what we voted on in the House floor we didn't vote on more money okay they
*  had days to give more money because this was earlier in the week we actually voted
*  on that we was 2339 which is reversing the youth tobacco epidemic act that was
*  a bill to ban flavored tobacco according to House Democrats things like hookah
*  grizzly wintergreen which is maybe what I might like is now illegal now it never
*  got into law of course because it never went through the Senate but I want
*  people to understand like I'm not even I'm not blaming Democrats either because
*  there was a lot that we all just didn't know and I just want I just want to
*  point these things out because it's important to give each other to grace to
*  be like hey not everybody knew what was happening it wasn't until early March
*  that it was exploding as a virus in Iran and Italy and South Korea these things
*  happened and it wasn't it wasn't clear that there should be massive massive
*  lockdowns of society those are very bold moves and it's so easy to have this
*  2020 hindsight and and act you know holier than thou and point fingers but
*  it's it's highly disingenuous and I and I built this whole timeline out to show
*  it and I also point out that the timeline can end you know that from here
*  on out we could just we could just give each other some grace and solve these
*  problems together because it will be very easy to blame each other for the
*  deaths of Americans no matter what the decision is it will be easy because the
*  counterfactual is impossible to prove and the fact that it's so easy that
*  political opportunism is so easy is is what worries me the most and like we
*  have to have those conversations though about reopening society and when to do
*  it and we have to have the conversations about this political
*  opportunism and and shaming it and and calling it for what it is and and really
*  being honest with those quotes from the Washington Post the New York Times USA
*  Today and letting people know no we didn't know what this was we didn't see
*  it coming and when it was coming we were real confused as to what the
*  consequences were going to be and we're also not getting honest data out of
*  China right China China is just they are not honest about the body count they're
*  not honest about any of it we don't really know what happened over there the
*  version that we're getting is got holes in it oh yeah let's talk about that I
*  did find the quotes that I told you I had okay I hear those are there from
*  people like Jen Rubin like CNN so Jen Rubin Trump death toll equals Trump dead
*  lives that would have been spared had he acted on warnings the rest of victims
*  the rest are victims of Trump's stupidity and narcissism this is from a
*  prominent Washington Post columnist again I'm not choosing random Twitter
*  users you know from the New York Times President Trump was so focused on
*  fabricating threats involving Central American caravans that he was oblivious
*  to the real threats so again I could keep reading I have a bunch but let's
*  talk about China yeah so I just mentioned that one that story that just
*  came out which is that they actually prevented PPE from being delivered
*  outside of China so they you know we are our companies 3m they produce it there
*  should have been exported out they prevented that there was a study that
*  showed that if they had if they had actually been honest and given us given
*  the world three weeks extra notice 95% of the spread could have been contained
*  okay five million people left Wuhan they allowed travel out of Wuhan five million
*  people were traveling all over China all over the world the reason this this
*  became so bad in Italy and Iran is because of the Belt and Road initiative
*  these are major hotspots for China's economic development and the Belt and
*  Road initiative so then let's get into the World Health Organization there's
*  got to be a come to Jesus moment on the World Health Organization again mid
*  January World Health Organization says that says that or they repeat the claims
*  made by China that that that it can't even be transmitted human to human
*  contact on January 30th World Health Organization says something along the
*  lines of there's no reason to be shutting down travel or limiting travel
*  so they are directly controlled by the Chinese government the World Health
*  Organization it should also be worth noting I forget the guy's name who runs
*  it the director of the who but he's believes from Ethiopia and Ethiopia is
*  one of these countries that is a huge and has a huge investments from the Belt
*  and Road initiative and so I mean we need to be calling for a complete
*  complete change out in leadership at the WHL I mean we've seen that video where
*  they refused to acknowledge he refuses to acknowledge the existence of Taiwan
*  he wouldn't even say it the one that keeps questioning him and he shuts his
*  camera off yeah it was like when you asked me about marijuana use and I
*  pretended I couldn't hear you you were joking though we were right in front of
*  each other joking that's different I mean that guy yeah he shut his connection
*  off and then he said China's doing a great job let's move on and you know
*  like what very way it's so deeply corrupt is so deeply corrupt and I mean
*  you know I don't think that who will ever have the standing that it did
*  before not without an immediate and serious leadership change because they've
*  lost all credibility and then move on you know fast forward the Chinese were
*  perpetuating it's unclear whether they started this room this this talking
*  point or whether it was the progressive left and the Chinese just repeated it
*  and latched on to it but this whole notion that it's racist to call the
*  virus the Chinese virus was it was such an utterly absurd thing that we were
*  focused on as a country when that just doesn't matter it just didn't no matter
*  no matter what your opinion on whether it's actually racist or not I mean I
*  personally don't think it is there's a G there's there's a history of calling a
*  virus some kind of geographic name based on where it's from that's fine the point
*  is is that Chinese authorities were tweeted we're spreading that quite a bit
*  in February so they're doing things like that then they claim that perhaps
*  it was the US Army that had started the virus in Wuhan they haven't let
*  international inspectors go in and investigate the the origins of this
*  virus so that we can better understand it they've I mean that's there's gonna
*  be there already is quite a few things that we're looking at it is what we can
*  do to one rebalance our supply chains that as a country we need a better
*  industrial policy on bringing a lot of important manufacturing back home and
*  being more competitive in that sense is there can I ask you this is there any
*  evidence that this was a man-made virus you know this is the big conspiracy
*  theory that there was some sort of a level four bio weapons lab in Wuhan yeah
*  and I just don't know I mean I could pontificate but it is true that there was
*  a bio weapons lab yeah yeah I don't know if it's meant for weapons but there's
*  certainly a lab there that would have housed viruses like this and yeah we just
*  we just don't know the answers and I don't you know especially in my position
*  I don't want to of course of course I don't want to I don't want to assume do
*  you think that this because of the consequences of this virus and all this
*  that this awakens people to the need to manufacture things in America
*  particularly particularly medical supplies so many things that we rely on
*  China for 100% and this is this is something Trump has been talking about
*  forever and I think both I think he's received skepticism from both the left
*  and the right on that for different reasons mostly from the right because you
*  know we we have and the Republicans need to come to terms with this is we have
*  really adhered very closely to a more libertarian mindset of free trade where
*  the more free trade the better where where if somebody else can make it
*  cheaper then then we should just have them make it all right this comparative
*  advantage theory and that's true in theory it is true but but we can't ignore
*  the consequences and I think we have ignored those consequences for a little
*  too long like what happens when you when you close down that factory yeah like
*  your t-shirts are three cents cheaper per unit which is a really big deal for
*  the margins of your company and yeah that company can hire more people and
*  you get a cheaper t-shirt but but we kind of miss those manufacturing jobs
*  like there if you're there's a there's also a there's like a moral or not a
*  moral but it's like a psychological benefit to these manufacturing jobs as
*  well you're creating something people like that people like to feel like
*  they're producing something and that they have meaningful work that pays
*  pretty decent and so there's consequences and there's consequences to
*  the efficiency that has occurred and then there's national security
*  consequences and we're learning about those right now and it's not just
*  medical supplies that we need to take a look at I'm from Houston so our oil and
*  gas industry is in is in a big big dire straits right now we risk we risk the
*  possibility that we lose energy into between Russia and Saudi Arabia now
*  hopefully I think the administration's been able to use some diplomatic pressure
*  and figure that out to an extent but there's we have to come to we have to
*  decide whether we think there's value in doing things ourselves that's the
*  ultimate question and I would answer that yes there is now do we take it to
*  an extreme no but are we out of balance right now maybe yes and maybe we do need
*  to look at changing our supply chains maybe that means some things are just
*  slightly more expensive maybe that's what it means but but for a lot of
*  element for a lot of items we have to be looking at that we'd be thinking that
*  way well I think I think also when you look at what are the consequences of
*  allowing us to have things manufactured over there what kind of karma do we take
*  on for when you look at Foxconn those buildings where they manufacture iPhones
*  they have nets around them to keep people from jumping off like yeah how
*  many people have to jump before you put nets up and like what what what has to
*  happen there where your your your life sucks so hard to make an iPhone I mean
*  how much would it cost to make those here is it worth it for us and you know
*  is there some the real value in that the label that we used to love to look for
*  Made in America that's that's not really discussed that much anymore but I think
*  it would be wise for all of us to invest in that idea again yeah and the problem
*  is is like we we hold ourselves to those standards of good labor conditions and
*  good environmental standards and we but we punish ourselves almost out of
*  business completely and so we punish ourselves out of business usually for
*  through these specific regulations labor or environmental but then we also engage
*  in free trade so it almost guarantees that we lose out our own manufacturing
*  base or sometimes the energy sector whatever it is because we simultaneously
*  make ourselves less competitive while also forcing our people to compete
*  against people who are who work their employees so hard that they have to
*  build nets around their office yeah as they throw themselves off of it that's
*  such a good question by the way like yeah how many how many people actually
*  jump before they put the nets what is the number that is just a crazy
*  reality and it's also one that we just accept because we want an iPhone and I
*  mean Apple's one of the most profitable countries the I mean companies rather
*  the world's ever known I mean it's a spectacularly profitable company and
*  like and and there's there's a whole of government policy and a whole society
*  I'm gonna say government it's really society that we all have to kind of
*  collectively look at this and it's gonna take the private sector as well
*  because Apple would tell you okay I'd love to do I'd love to open up a plant
*  here and they do but they'd like to do more the reason they don't is because
*  when they put out that job application nobody will show up or at least not
*  enough people and so and so what does that tell you it tells you that we're
*  not educating people in the skills that are necessary to engage in these jobs
*  there's a lot of technical skills that we are not teaching because so this gets
*  to an education policy why aren't we promoting more stem why aren't we
*  promoting via the you know the federal loan program student loans why aren't we
*  promoting things and majors that actually get us to a higher paying job
*  why you know why why should the taxpayer be on the hook for a major that is
*  guaranteed not to pay anything once you graduate like what are you gonna do with
*  that degree and it's whatever who knows like you can name but you know what I'm
*  talking but you can name a bunch right and gender studies whatever it's these
*  are not high-paying things and they're not useful for the economy that that we
*  want and so what kind of incentives need to shift is my is my point to encourage
*  more of that so that Apple when they do look at a place to build a new factory
*  they can be they can be confident that people will actually show up to work
*  there one more question Dan before we go when you run it for president I know
*  you're gonna I mean I'm in my 30s come on I got I got so much time four years
*  well yeah I mean technically yeah but but now I know how old you I'm really
*  not I'm really not planning on that come on stop line 36 you 36 when you're 40
*  that would be perfect that's that's the time I don't know perfect I mean I I do
*  like being in politics I like having a voice it's a place I never thought I I
*  would be the day before I decided to run for Congress I was about to take a job
*  working at the Department of Defense just kind of moving along my same
*  trajectory and like the national security space but uh I I like this I
*  I've always loved policy I've always loved thinking through these things and
*  kind of the foundations of what makes this country great and you know I think
*  we've got great years ahead but uh yeah I'm not I'm just answer your question
*  super honestly I'm just not not thinking about it there's so much changes in
*  politics right now so much so much changes from year to year like so much
*  it's crazy how how it's not like a there's no pipeline in politics it
*  doesn't work that way you know whether you're running for the first time or
*  whether you're trying to move up to a different position it's just like you
*  just got to do it feels right and when the people want it and the people will
*  let you know when they want it that's a very good diplomatic answer and I think
*  you're uniquely qualified for politics I appreciate you I appreciate how
*  reasonable you are and how honest and objective you are and I always enjoy
*  talking to you so thank you very much Dan and good luck with your book it's
*  called fortitude it's out right now go get it folks and I'll put it up on my
*  Instagram and all that good stuff too thank you sir appreciate you man and
*  really appreciate you Joe stay safe out there you too all right bye everybody
*  thanks Joe
