# Joe Rogan Experience #1498 - Jon Stewart
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 26, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXOUCRLW2UI)
*  Hi, John Stewart. Hi Joe Rogan. What's going on behind you? What is all that jazz? Oh
*  It's all my when my kids were younger. This is their club. I'm in the attic
*  When they were younger came up here with their cousins and doodle and then I got kicked up here
*  It's my office now and I'm here with the bunny and the guinea pig in the rat. Hey, man. I miss you
*  I miss you on TV right now. I really do. This is a perfect time for you
*  It's kind of crazy that you're not hosting that show anymore
*  But there's so many people doing that. You know, I was I really did burn out like I I felt like it's just redundant
*  you know the nice thing for what you do is you get to curate and kind of be more active in to
*  Follow your own rhythm for it. I was really tied to that rhythm of
*  The
*  24-hour news cycle right and how fucking redundant it is and how cyclical and
*  At a certain point I was like, I don't know what else to do with this
*  And so I didn't want to stay just because I could I just done it long enough
*  And so I thought well, let me just it was just time. I thought like the audience needed a fresh perspective
*  I needed a fresh perspective. Like I just I just felt
*  Done like I was more I was more mad about shit then then
*  Inspired, you know, I appreciate that you decided to go out at the literally at the very top, but it seems like
*  Especially like right now
*  John Oliver's killing it and Trevor Noah's doing your show and it's like this is this is that there's so much to mock
*  It's almost like an overload and doing real commentary on politics today in my opinion
*  It's almost like you're doing commentary on pro wrestling
*  Like this is a rig game and you're out here pretending like this shit makes sense
*  Yes, it really is. You're right. Well, it's also because that's the economic system that's been set up
*  around politics is
*  The very same that Vince McMahon set up around wrestling you create
*  I mean it is a kind of you know, okay fade. It's a sort of like yeah, there are characters
*  You know what? It's like when you're trying to produce something every day
*  You're gonna go with kind of a boilerplate structure. So you're gonna say alright our show revolves around
*  You're from the right. You're from the left whatever comes in. We're gonna filter it through that. We're gonna keep it
*  Producible, but it starts to like you say it becomes, you know authentic
*  But the same thing would happen to me sometimes with
*  like I'd be doing shows and and you would know you weren't necessarily feeling the
*  outrage of something or
*  That the commentary was gonna be as spicy or as deep as you might want it
*  But you might kick it up a notch anyway, because it was performative and I always said I always had to fight that instinct
*  to not
*  To not give in to the gravity of like
*  What was expected?
*  Well, it's such it's such a tightrope to walk because you're commenting you're doing comedy on something
*  That's actually serious and it's great to mock the ridiculous aspects of it
*  But really like if you're doing the The Daily Show right now, like we really are in a legitimately troubled time
*  Like it's not it's not like a troubled time of ten years ago or eight years ago. Like this is a real troubled time
*  No, and I think as that builds up it becomes harder and harder but I can recall
*  You know people people will say sometimes and look I think there's a certain nostalgia that people
*  View my time on the show has
*  And I'm not being so delicate. I just mean, you know when you walk away from something
*  I think a kind of nostalgia about how
*  you know, I took a fair amount of shit while I was there and
*  And
*  But but the point is like
*  Charleston happened when I was hosting that show Ferguson happened the Iraq war happened 9-eleven happened like Jesus
*  these types of things were always and
*  and what would happen is you started to feel like
*  You were expected to say something
*  You knew that you didn't really
*  Have that in you at times or just that's a bar that was beyond, you know, you really did just want to help
*  Your staff get through it more than than anything else. And so these events would come up and the weight of
*  Feeling like you had to say something
*  meaningful in that moment for people
*  because that's the role that
*  Because that's the role that
*  Either they had, you know, let you know that you had in their lives or that the show kind of took on
*  You know became
*  Kind of difficult to navigate
*  Because the shit is so cyclical like man I could go back and and do you my ten war on Christmas bits
*  Here when that shit would flare up
*  But like at a certain point when things like Charleston happened or Eric Garner like I had nothing in the tank comedically like all I could do
*  Was stare into the camera and just express
*  Sadness and helpless it's like
*  You know what it is. It's impotent rage at a certain point. Hmm rage against it
*  But over a period of 16 years if you feel
*  The thing you're raging against grows stronger, right?
*  And kind of collapse on top you and you not make it way
*  Nobody likes to piss in the ocean. Yeah, you know or you like it, but at a certain point if that's your job, I
*  think it I
*  Think people began to look at the show like it was supposed to change things and
*  And that's a hard that's a hard place to be for for a comedy show
*  well, it's because you're reasonable and
*  There's not a lot of that out there and like legitimately and like the people are like, please you do it
*  Look people are begging for the rock to run for president. This is how desperate we are
*  People have asked me to do it. Look, I'm a fucking bona fide moron. You don't want me running anything
*  You certainly don't want me running the country and if enough people have actually asked for that
*  you just know there's a feeling of desperation in the air and
*  You know when you were running that show and you were you were doing great comedy
*  About real shit and as this real shit compounds and piles up and it doesn't seem to have any
*  Effect on this real shit all this great comedy after a while. I can understand why it would start to feel like
*  What am I doing here? Like?
*  How long how long do you do? You know who what is that guy's name?
*  Who was doing the resistance the guy was in the basement of GQ Ken Olbermann Keith Olbermann. Sorry
*  Yeah
*  Little unhinged right he was doing this thing in the basement against Trump and he's like
*  It's just days from now when Trump is going to be arrested and I could feel
*  That this was also kind of what he was doing
*  Like he was trying to make some sort of an impact, but it just kept not working. It kept not working
*  Yeah, it's still all chaos and he's like fuck this and then he just walked away from it
*  You know, it seems like
*  Trying to enact change is so difficult that when actual change happens
*  It's one of the reasons why it happens in such a big way
*  It's like there was so many people bounding at the wall and pounding at this wall that when boom when the George Floyd
*  Protests broke through then all of a sudden it's we've got real change
*  let's take down these fucking statues and light everything on fire and there's this feeling of
*  Change and of chaos that is also representative of the fact that it takes so long to turn our cultural battleship
*  It's like to actually get a real turn. It's so hard
*  It's so everything stays the same no matter how mad people get that turn
*  Even at that point that's still the easy part
*  Yes
*  The term is the easy part like this shit's not gonna get fixed by HBO Max pulling gone with the wind like
*  It's fine
*  Like when you pull a movie nobody was planning on watching on a streaming service. Nobody can find like
*  We're still at the symbolic stage. Yeah, we're still doing the shit that is symbolic when and this is where leadership
*  Becomes such a crucial
*  Component so you have this great awakening of energy
*  It has to be channeled into something lasting and meaningful and we have to diagnose
*  The real problem underlying
*  This moment so that we don't make a mistake and just changing the window dressing and
*  And the gilding on the buildings. Yeah, like this has to be this has to be
*  Foundational in a way that will create something lasting and that's that's the hard part
*  It seems like the shift is big enough that something is gonna happen in that regard
*  It just seems like this shift is nothing like anything we've ever seen in our lifetime and it's worldwide
*  Which is really crazy like the George Floyd deaths sparked all these protests worldwide
*  which has really never happened before with anything that really has taken place in America and
*  It just seems like there was also a lot of frustration
*  During the bailout period of the kovat crisis that all these corporations were getting so much money
*  the people got one $1,200 check and then
*  Then there was no more talk and it this you don't know where the money, you know
*  There's really no accountability even for where that money went, right? That's a great point Joe because that's
*  So that's what I'm talking about by structural change. Like I feel like in this moment
*  this
*  horrible
*  crime and murder sparked something but what's
*  underlying that is not just the racial inequality than these inequities but this whole idea of
*  We build our society economically from the top down. Yes, that's the shit that's got to change right?
*  Well, like when you talk when you're in a pandemic, right and
*  Tens of thousand people are dying and then we say to ourselves. All right. Well, who are the essential workers?
*  Who are the ones that are the fabric of our society and culture that keep the the the wheels turning and
*  The trains running like who are those people? Well, it turns out they're the most poorly
*  Compensated people in our society. Yeah, as we flipped the the paradigm
*  For some reason since the 80s the investor class
*  Has gotten the break and the working class has gotten minimized. We've devalued work while
*  overvaluing investment
*  It's such a good point it does I don't think we can have
*  The structural change until we flip that like fuck man when people talk about freedom
*  Like and and liberty what's more?
*  For freedom and liberty than not having your health insurance tied to your job, right?
*  Yeah, what kind of freedom do you have to make decisions in your life?
*  When you fear that if I take a chance if I go for something if I try and change my lot in life
*  My kids will no longer be covered by
*  like all the things that we built up to accept I
*  think we have to
*  turn it over and it has to lean more people should be able to have like a
*  Dignified you should be able to work a job and not be poor
*  You should get a working job and not need food stamps. Like that's where we're fucked. We spent
*  Well, how much in this pandemic like three trillion dollars something like that four trillion something along those lines
*  Who knows if a hundred million of it went to coca-cola like we have no idea, right?
*  But you got 80 bus drivers in New York who were dead
*  Because they had to keep going. Yeah in the pandemic. Yeah, I think you're making a really good point about what's essential as well when
*  When we found out that what the essential workers are right people who work at supermarkets
*  People build homes like all these essential jobs
*  Yes, right
*  You're putting yourself in you know, it's funny. I was talking a friend of mine in DT who is
*  You know, he was really like previously wounded
*  In war right and I was thought we were talking about like coronavirus and I was like I feel like
*  I'm in fucking danger when I go out. Hmm. Yeah, welcome to being down range like
*  It's just not it's not something that we as Americans would ever consider our lives
*  We're we're really sheltered in a lot of ways to what a great
*  Vast majority of the world faces but also the vast majority of our own citizens face in terms of
*  Having lies that lives that they feel are built on sand
*  as opposed to granite and so his point was like
*  Yeah, you know, that's what it feels like when you're in a war
*  But I signed up for that but like bus drivers and grocery store workers like they had to fucking decide like I
*  Need this money more than I need to protect my life and maybe the health of my family
*  what a terrible position to have to be and
*  Unprecedented and and we're ill prepared for it and it really did highlight what's essential though
*  Which is good back to your point about this idea of income equality
*  Like people will balk at that like hey
*  This is a game if you want to figure it out
*  Figure out how to make more money invest and do this and become a banker and you fucked up and you wanted to be
*  An artist or you fucked up and you wanted to be a carpenter you should have been a you know, whatever and
*  But what they don't understand or don't consider is when shit hits the fan like it did with the kovat crisis you recognize
*  Like hey all that stuff is nonsense if someone doesn't take out the garbage all that stuff is nonsense
*  If you don't have health care all that stuff is not
*  None of that money means anything if the fabric of society
*  deteriorates to a point where literally everybody has to stay in their home and you can't work and that's what happened and it really flipped the
*  Whole thing on its head because we we had to consider survival
*  We had a really consider survival instead of just existence. We were saying oh my god, we have to protect ourselves from this
*  viral
*  viral attack and
*  What it makes you realize is how much money it takes to anti up?
*  To the American way of life what I mean by that is like
*  If you want to buy if you just want to buy into play a hand, right? What's your ante?
*  Well now they say you got to go to college. So you're talking about a
*  $200,000 ante yeah to get in the fucking game
*  Right to get a job when you get out where you're not gonna make a fraction of that every year
*  So you're gonna be behind the eight ball for the rest of your life, right?
*  now think about you know
*  Black people not being able to build equity and wealth through generations, right?
*  You know government policy that excluded them from you know
*  From whether it's the Homestead Act of the Federal Housing Administration or the GI bill, you know all these government interventions
*  socialism if you will
*  Entitlements if you will were made to help white families build equity right over generations black people were
*  Explicitly excluded from that
*  So add that on top of the amount of money that you're going and you start to see the hole that we've dug for people
*  Yeah, and if we don't address that hole, I don't care
*  How many fucking comedy sketches we pull and how many things go like we were not doing anything?
*  Yeah, we haven't addressed the hole that exists from being 150 years removed from slavery, which is crazy
*  That's not that's a
*  Blink in time. It's nothing and how crazy is it that like and you always I always hear it from like the buck people
*  They're like the George Floyd thing. Yeah, that was terrible. But they were soon as they say the bottom like no no, but no
*  But he wasn't an angel. No, but you know, he was
*  what doesn't matter and
*  When you're upset that people are pulling that Confederate statutes like people have been begging for that
*  Since they got those things got put up in the 1920s
*  To really lock in Jim Crow like those things aren't there. They're not memorials
*  to the dead their hagiography to a
*  war for slavery like
*  Well, we shot the movie down Southman. So I saw these monuments you would think they would say like
*  Here's a statue of Robert E Lee this motherfucker
*  To
*  Keep people slaves and then we built this thing in the 20s to make black people kind of afraid so that they knew they
*  Couldn't take but it doesn't say that right say
*  This this great man like of course people are gonna pull them down because they've been begging for us to do something about it
*  For a hundred years. It's also the origins of those a lot of those statues were actually put up during the civil rights movement
*  And they're simply made they were put up as a
*  Middle finger to the civil rights movement. No, no question. Yeah, but but we need something
*  Hey like there has to be a process, you know, I always think about like what South Africa did there has to be a painful
*  lead process that allows us because I still think to this day and I don't know how your experience with this is but like I
*  Still think there's a large swath of
*  you know white people in society who feel like
*  They blame black people for not being able to get out of this hole
*  That we put them in or that the government put them in but they think it's a problem of culture and virtue
*  like hey man if they would just
*  Pull the pants up and talk different, you know, they wouldn't have such a hard time. Hey, why don't you just work harder?
*  Yeah
*  It's a ridiculous perspective and it's also not based on you don't have it
*  Anyone who would think like that doesn't understand how human beings develop and grow if you have someone
*  It's widespread. I don't say it
*  Yeah, it's it's it's a dangerous narrative
*  whenever you blame people for their circumstances if their circumstances are grossly out of their control and
*  Really severely limit their progress and that exists also for if you want to talk about coal mining populations in
*  Kentucky, it's the same shit. It's people that we don't all start out at the same starting block
*  So all you pull yourself up by your own bootstrap motherfuckers. You're lucky you have arms. Okay
*  There's people out there born with no arms like we should all be
*  Thinking of ourselves in this country as a community not as a bunch of people in competition with each other
*  We're all piling our money together every year
*  We throw our taxes into the mix to try to take care of the infrastructure and the government and the housing and all the all
*  The different things that get paid for by our taxes. We're a community man, and we're not thinking like a community
*  we're thinking like a bunch of people that don't want other people to
*  Have the same shot in life
*  That's it. But I think you struck on something though. That's very important in all this and that is a
*  Theory of limited resources. Yes. Oh the conflict between
*  What you would consider like the the more nativist wing of American politics and and
*  The more progressive side is this idea of resource guarding. Yeah, we're gonna they're gonna take I work my fucking ass off
*  I play by the rules and they're gonna take all my labor, right?
*  And they're gonna put it into these people and I do think we have to address
*  that idea that like
*  We're here to build equity
*  Let's all get together and the project of this next generation is to build a stronger foundation a
*  Granite bearing for everyone to stand on so that there's a few people standing on Mount Everest and everybody else is in sand and
*  Sand isn't the way that we run the society and and think of these programs not as
*  entitlements but investments in
*  In
*  Dignity of workshit and start building that up
*  well
*  Food stamps and welfare start to go away. Yeah, because we're building something more
*  Substantial we built a great middle class in the 50s for white people
*  We have to do the same now for the country and and for
*  and also reassure
*  You know people who are resentful of that
*  That they're not being left behind either that nobody is saying and your lives are fucking cake
*  It's not like it's gonna change your life that much either man
*  This this mentality that all Bernie Sanders like when I was a supporter of Bernie Sanders when he was running
*  I got pushback from people that were like so you want to give your hard-earned money
*  More of it away to the government and you think the government is gonna solve this
*  My my perspective was if you just looked at it this way
*  If you could give let's just get crazy if you could give 25% more money to taxes, but the world would be 50% better
*  Wouldn't you want to invest in that? Like I understand that people are check to check. I understand but if
*  People like me people that earn a good amount of money are the ones are gonna be hit the hardest if you wanted a better world
*  Wouldn't you be willing to invest some of your money into that better world?
*  And if that money goes to making sure that no one has to do this in the future and that we we develop this
*  Better come these better communities in these places that have been fucked for decades
*  You what you don't want that you don't want a better world for your children. You want it?
*  You don't want to savor. What do you want to do die with all this money in the bank? Like it's crazy
*  It's a question of you know, when you look at the greatest anti-poverty program we've ever put in place in Social Security
*  now the flip side of that is what they'll say is that
*  The problem with some of this is they don't trust the mechanism by which that money is going to be invested
*  Of course because they've been sold to some extent a little bit of a lie that that this trickle-down theory. So
*  Every administration that comes in is going to stimulate the economy. They all do it
*  We don't have a free market the Fed right now is driving so much money into stocks
*  About zero interest rates negative interest rates, right? They're driving everything away from
*  bonds and savings so that the stock market which
*  For some reason we've come to look at like a pulse oximeter of the nation, which it's it's not it's you know
*  Oh my god, we lost 300 dows today. Like we've come to look at it. Like it's our temperature. Yeah
*  So everybody's gonna stimulate the economy. So what did what let's look at what Trump did
*  $1.5 trillion tax cut, right?
*  Overwhelmingly though it went to people who already have a shit ton of money and
*  Then we cut the corporate tax rate from I don't I think was 35 down to 21, right?
*  Supposedly they were going to reinvest it but they mostly did buybacks. So they're increasing their investor wealth through that as well
*  So you're talking about
*  Trillions of dollars of stimulus, right?
*  That are just going to that same theory
*  Take those trillion dollars and let's invest let's stimulate the economy, but not from up there from down here. Let's do it
*  let's take that and
*  fucking Marshall plan our country and
*  And build it so that it's sturdy on the legs
*  You know, you know, you're a fighter sturdy on the legs
*  If you're not starting on the legs you got nothing
*  My idea is we should get dick Cheney involved and we should hire
*  Halliburton to fix up the inner cities like it did all the places we bombed in Iraq
*  Give us some no-bid contracts pour that money back in the community. I mean I'm joking about Halliburton
*  But it is a business. There's something there
*  Well, I had a thing, you know, we're trying to do this thing for veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan
*  Who've gotten sick from burn pits, are you familiar at all with with burn pits? No, what is it?
*  so in the Iraq war in the Afghanistan, I mean for
*  This will go back generations, but in Iraq and Afghanistan a lot of the
*  Hired contractors to dispose of the detritus of war they would build these sometimes 10 acre 20 acre pits
*  everything would go into them from
*  Mess waste to hazardous materials to computers
*  Everything they light it with jet fuel and they burn
*  So now you got guys that are down range that are also down. I mean they're living they're basically camping out
*  Yeah, and toxic waste dump, right?
*  So they come home and you're starting to see
*  pulmonary issues cancer issues
*  These guys are dying yeah, and they're not be it's not being they have to advocate against the government
*  So we're trying to put together working with this
*  team coalition
*  Moon warrior groups and people VSOs and groups like that
*  To address this legislatively similar to what was done for the the 9-eleven community, right?
*  So I thought
*  Because it's always about money, you know
*  We always have money for war but we almost never have money to pay for what are the absolutely
*  Could have seen coming a mile away consequences of what our veterans face when they come back, right?
*  you don't take care when they're when they're out when they're out of sight they're out of mind and
*  So my idea was you have all these profiteers
*  Ray Theon Halliburton all these groups make them kick in 10% big
*  a contingency in war so that when these guys go home and the government
*  backs away there is money there to take care of what is the natural
*  Damage
*  That's done to these people in the name of fighting for our country
*  So that they don't and their families I mean these people have to become their own lawyers
*  In front of medical boards and they have no support their families are oftentimes
*  caring for them whether they have health issues or traumatic brain injury or
*  You know other kinds of invisible wounds and they're kind of hung out to draw. Yes, not kind of very much so
*  You know the UFC had a program back in the day where we were
*  working with the intrepid Center for excellence to work with the
*  Traumatic brain injury patients and to raise money for them
*  And we were doing this UFC fight for the troops to raise money for it and what got me sick was
*  How how is it that we have to do this?
*  Like how is it that this isn't something that's taken care of in the budget clearly in advance
*  You're blowing people up and you're you're you're not preparing for people to come back injured
*  You're sending young brave women and men to die for their country or or risk severe brain damage
*  And you don't have enough money set aside to treat them when they return. I'm like, that's insane
*  everybody thinks that
*  Soldiers come back and they've got health care for life. No, no, they don't
*  You've got a five-year window, but if you get something that they deem was not service related
*  So you could have been sleeping next to an open-air burn pit. No
*  There's a guy in Texas where we work with his wife Rosie and Leroy Torres who's literally like his case
*  Wouldn't be they denied his case in front of the Texas Supreme Court. Yeah, it's evil this this
*  Absolute intention to deny health care and it goes all the way back to Desert Storm
*  You remember you remember the whole
*  To Vietnam. Yes. Yes
*  Fighting the government over Agent Orange, right and still being denied. Yeah, but yeah
*  Bunkers it's crazy and the depleted radiation sickness that people were getting from the Iraq war
*  Right and and the guys that went, you know that that k2 base. Yeah
*  and I think it was Uzbekistan and it was a
*  Toxic weight like these soldiers literally had like irradiated tar on their boots
*  Yeah, sick as shit and they can't get you know, there's blue water horizon. There's I'm telling you like every
*  Inevitably and they're always told the same thing. Hey, we don't have the science yet
*  And you know, it's gonna take us 20 to 25 years on the science
*  But you do have the signs because you got the science from Vietnam like yeah
*  Jet fuel burn at the Trade Center
*  So like the science is in use that science like stop fucking with these people and help them
*  Yeah, the jet fuel burn at the Trade Center is another excellent example of first responders right that were terribly
*  Sick and and many many of them died because of the fumes and and people in the the surrounding areas in fact
*  Summers died of lung cancer and she lived near there. Yeah, I don't doubt that it's related could be related but
*  People did
*  Jimmy's drover he was a cop and he got really sick
*  I mean those guys developed the the pile cough like a day into the search and rescue but Jimmy's enjoy
*  but he gets sick and
*  They kept trying to tell him that a first it was in his head
*  And then it was it had nothing to do with
*  Where you were and and working on the pile in 9-eleven and then they tried to say like it's from snorting drugs
*  They fucking you know ruin this man's reputation as he's dying. He dies. They do an autopsy in his lungs
*  Everything you could possibly imagine from a pulverized building Jesus
*  Asbestos
*  limestone cyanide like
*  Like it was an utter
*  Disaster and and they just keep fighting people and they're doing the same thing to these veterans now
*  With with the the burn pits and it's you know, the whole thing's just got to stop that there's got to be a presumption
*  For these illnesses so that these guys don't have to fight so hard to get
*  Discipline your health care. I think along the same lines. We're talking about reform of the police department
*  there has to be some reform of the health care system that deals with veterans because it seems to be just as long history of
*  Doing it a certain way to save the most money possible and the idea that these guys are sacrificial
*  Anyway, you know, they're sending them off to potentially die if they come back alive
*  We you know
*  We do our very they do our their very best to not treat them and to not spend any more money on them
*  It's sick
*  It's amazing. We have so many guys that are still patriotic that still want to go and do this
*  Considering the fact they're treated so poorly when they return
*  Yeah, and they lose, you know, listen being in the military is isolating in the first place. It's just not that you know
*  It's only less than 1% I think of the population
*  Put on top of that when you get out, you know, you're used to being with a unit
*  You're used to that camaraderie. You're used to all pulling for the same, you know working as a team
*  Well now you're removed from your unit and if you're hurt that's even further isolating
*  You know and in that moment to have to then you're worried about your future your family's future and in that moment
*  When you when that's when the government should step in and go hey, man
*  Were you fulfilled your service to us you fulfilled that covenant?
*  We will fulfill that covenant to you, you know, we will send that that you know, we'll do the right thing
*  Right and they and they do the opposite they do the opposite
*  it's some of the shit is so simple and fair and obvious and you do wonder like
*  How has the system become so corrupt and corroded that we can't anymore as a people
*  Do the right thing just do the right fucking thing. How did that? How'd we get here?
*  Well, I think again this speaks to what's going on in this country in terms of revolt that we realize like all this stuff
*  Well, you're talking about the health care system whether you're talking about police reform whether you're talking about impoverished communities
*  That are stricken with crime and drugs. It's not changing
*  Under the normal conditions like something has to happen and something has to happen in a big way to change it and all these
*  Things need to be addressed right health care of soldiers needs to be addressed reform of the police
*  Reform of these communities like it has to be addressed if you're gonna spend trillions of dollars to bail out these large corporations
*  You got us. You've got to work on these other problems, too
*  You can't just ignore them because they're not the ones who are funding your campaign
*  And that's but that's a huge issue and that's the thing that's got us up look at even 2008, right? So we have this enormous
*  economic collapse in 2008 housing market sinks and these
*  Derivative mortgage
*  things go down and
*  The world economy grinds to a halt
*  thousands people lose a job foreclosures all over the place so they come in and
*  They pump billions of dollars
*  into the organizations
*  That sunk the fucking ship in the first place. Yeah, that's where the money goes and I remember asking the Treasury Secretary at the time
*  You
*  Know this is a mortgage question right because they the derivatives made it like the geometric problem
*  So if they're bundling mortgages and 8% of those mortgages go underwater
*  It sinks the derivatives market, which is trillions of dollars as opposed to billions of dollars. So I said
*  You know with all that money. What if you just
*  Made those mortgages that were underwater hole
*  Because the moment you do that doesn't that fix your derivative problem?
*  Don't you haven't you just made and plus then people get to keep their houses and
*  What he said to me was you can't do that because of moral hazard, huh?
*  So moral hazard is a theory that you can't incentivize bad behavior
*  So what he's saying is the people that took out mortgages on their homes
*  That went underwater
*  That's their fault
*  So you can't bail them out because that would be sending a hazardous message
*  morally
*  About the economy. So I said
*  What's the moral hazard of then get making the people that actually blew up the economy whole again?
*  What's that? How is that not moral hazard and he said?
*  The plane was on fire and we had to land
*  Wow, they were the ones who lit the plane on fire. How are you you're rewarding them for that? Yeah
*  Yeah, it's I've heard both sides that argument
*  I've heard the argument that no nothing's too big to fail
*  Let it fail and then I've heard the argument that if it did feel fail would be so catastrophic
*  But I'm saying it wouldn't have failed. So it was a failure because they bought. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they did it all to themselves
*  But if you made the mortgages at the base of that, okay
*  So let's say 10% of the mortgages were underwater
*  But you know, so let's say you had a $200,000 mortgage and now the house is only worth $150,000
*  So instead of giving a million dollars to AIG at the top give
*  $50,000 to that mortgage bring it into line with its value suddenly that things not underwater anymore
*  It's like putting ballast into a ship that's sinking
*  Put the ballast in the ship comes up rather than just saying all right, we'll buy you another fucking chip
*  That almost seems too logical though
*  That's
*  Right. That's kind of part of what's the problem with all this?
*  That's moral hazard I was just like I don't even know what to do with that
*  Incentivizing bad behavior doesn't count when you're the ones who tank the economy
*  I mean, it's not it's like what you're talking about today
*  Like if someone tried to say that these small businesses that are going under because of the COVID sanctions because everybody's been locked down rather
*  If if those people need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps
*  It's a great example why that analogy sucks because like there's nothing to do man. You can't work
*  There's nothing you like. What do you want them to do? There's no opportunity
*  It's everything shut down if you go under at this time. It's not your fault. It's one of the rare times
*  If I'm the government right now, here's something I could do that's like again like it seems like a
*  Simple solution which is like just suspend and extend. Yeah, so the country shut down, right?
*  What's people's oftentimes biggest worry my rent or my mortgage? Yeah, just end and extend. You know what?
*  We're gonna do a six month
*  suspend
*  Nobody is gonna be and if the landlords need to be helped out, that's where we'll focus
*  We'll make sure that the landlords don't go under from having to pay too much in taxes or having to pay too much in repairing but
*  Attack the problem at its core, which is people's insecurity about their unemployed
*  They have to still pay the rent and their mortgage or other bills. Let's take a big chunk of their nut
*  Oftentimes for people mortgage and rent is one of the biggest nuts
*  Just fucking say like because he's clearly we have the wherewithal and the money we're suspending and extending
*  everybody like
*  give people a chance to breathe just for a moment and
*  For the landlords, I'm not trying to dick them over like
*  Give them some kind of rent a real estate tax break or some operating expense or keep everybody. You know, it's almost like
*  Like you're a patient on a ventilator like let's just keep everybody a fucking live
*  Yeah, till we get past this moment because they keep saying well, we got a you know, we got a reopen the economy
*  We are the economy, right? There is no corporations may be people but they corporations still can't catch covid we can
*  So I don't understand why they don't do something that seems simple and addresses like a real concern
*  grassroots
*  on the on the floor
*  Again you speak too logically
*  It's a it's just a it's such a difficult time to politically because
*  The the ideas get segmented into left or right right like even the ideas of how to address
*  Covid how to address the economy how to address all the everything becomes politicized and
*  And
*  That's that's
*  Terrible
*  Fortune. Yeah, that's it's really unfortunate because well, it's even
*  Yeah, it's it's it shouldn't be that way and I'm not sure how it started that way and it's really unfortunate
*  There's got to be more emphasis on testing and there's got to be more emphasis on showing people how to keep their immune system
*  healthy and then recognizing people that can't do that and
*  Doing what we can to protect them
*  Joe Rogan and he's saying out loud. I'm gonna wear a mask now
*  Always been I was fucking with Bill Burr to try to get him to rant
*  People think I'm really serious about that
*  I was like what are you gonna wear a mask and I see Bill over there steaming. I'm like, here he goes
*  Here he goes. Look I wear a mask whenever I go out in public because it's the law
*  You know, I don't want anybody yelling at me. But also though when you side no, I get
*  Excuse me. I get tested all the time too. What's on a side note? What a great is burr. He's the best. I love him
*  He's so funny
*  He's so funny and so prolific, but here's the thing that I almost love you more
*  He'll just send me like a video of like a great drummer that he loves. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I took it up
*  He's really good. But I just love that dude. He's so good. He's great and I love getting him wound up
*  That's what I was doing with the whole mask thing and people think I was like really arguing
*  You shouldn't wear a mask or you're a bitch
*  God, it's but that's also the problem with soundbites on Twitter. Yeah. Yeah, it's
*  It exists. It's the content factory and you know anybody that creates content
*  you know
*  Then that goes out into the world and look they're looking for for eyeballs, too. And that's why I always feel like
*  like I take shit, but I can't complain about it because
*  That's part of the guy
*  Right. That's part of the game. That's what I do for a living
*  So like when people say let it go correctness, it's it's overwhelming. I just say like amen. It's just other people
*  pushing back and getting to say their shit and that's
*  Exactly what they should be doing the internet as democratized, you know outrage and
*  There's more speech now than there's ever been before in the history of the world like we all know, you know
*  it's like that what's the movie with a
*  Mel Gibson where he knows what women what we think. Yeah, right. So he had ESP
*  Twitter and the internet is just we all have developed ESP and now we know what everybody is thinking it's all every day
*  We're just bombarded by what everybody's thinking
*  Well, you're also bombarded by the people that spend the most time doing it because there's a lot of mentally unwell people that spend
*  Their entire day camped out on Twitter having arguments
*  And if you want to venture into that world and risk your consciousness and your health your met your literal mental health
*  By communicating in this really crude manner with text messages and you know arguing over
*  Semantics with people that you don't even know it's it's a terrible way to exist. Are you on Twitter?
*  Do you know I have a Twitter account, but I don't read it. It goes no
*  I post things on enter on Instagram. They go to Twitter occasionally I'll post things on Twitter, but I don't read it
*  It's just too toxic man. I
*  Get it, you know
*  And I know when I fucked up and I know when people are mad at me when it's legit and valid and I know when
*  They're mad at me for nonsense and I I am my worst self-critic
*  So I don't need other people yelling at me. I know what I did wrong. I stay clear
*  Healthy, I think that's the only approach you can have in this environment
*  I think it's a healthy way to look at it and you know
*  I always try and keep myself like you figure when people are coming at you
*  There's probably gonna be something constructive in there
*  Sometimes I've been energy to like find it and sometimes I'm just like I really can't do this. Yeah, sometimes you can't do it
*  But yeah, there's value in criticism. It's very important, but not too much
*  It's like anything else like you there's value in a little bit of snake venom you develop a tolerance
*  but if you get a big fat dose you're dead and
*  It's in many ways. It's the same with interacting with people that are upset with you
*  There's gonna be people that are upset with everybody for no reason no matter what the story is in the news
*  Even if it's clear-cut to you and I there's gonna be someone who has a violent opposition to that idea
*  It doesn't mean they're right and doesn't mean you're right
*  It just means people have a lot of different fucking ways of looking at the world
*  And if you want to exist in conflict in perpetuity stay on Twitter and stay on Twitter all day long and just argue with people
*  I don't want to do that, you know, and again, it's not that I don't have any room for improvement
*  It's not that I don't appreciate or accept or recognize the value of criticism because I definitely do
*  It's that it's not healthy. It's not healthy for me. It's not it could directly affect the kind of content I put out
*  It's not good. That's what I was about to say
*  Do you feel like one of the hardest thing to do is to maintain your kind of creative?
*  Barometer so that you don't let
*  those kinds of things
*  When you feel like they're not constructive
*  Pull you too far to
*  The outrage world or some other things like to maintain that and that's why I think it's good
*  Like what you do in terms of conversation like you basically say
*  You know, I'm gonna do long form because that you know feels like at least from my perspective
*  The healthiest form yeah is this conversation but is even in that case people will take long form
*  Edit things out of context and then it becomes the same problem that we have with Twitter and with everything else
*  You get these little sound bites these little video clips and you don't understand the full
*  Context of the conversation or what what was actually said and then people get outraged at that
*  It's you know, it's we are living in a very strange time and I believe it's an adolescent stage of communication
*  And I think it's going to give is our frustrations for this are going to give birth to a better form
*  And I think one of the things that podcasts
*  What it's in response to and the popularity of the long form is in response to people being upset with like these
*  traditional late-night talk show things where there's a window here with one guy on the right and a window here with a guy on the
*  Left and there's a person in the center and they're yelling at each other and then you cut to commercial and you don't really feel
*  Like things got resolved. So the response to that where people gravitate it's three. It's theater. Yeah, I think
*  This
*  Was it hard for you, you know
*  When we came up as comics, it was also at that point like it was sort of a gladiatorial
*  Environment, you know, and I remember, you know the Boston scene
*  You know was always like that's a tough scene. Yeah, you come up and it was kind of
*  Gladiatorial and but you had that audience and you develop kind of that thick skin. Is it hard to then make that switch?
*  In your mind to this different form that's so much more considered so much less about
*  Conquering the stage. Yeah, it is about being open and is that something that for you?
*  What was the switch for you from those two forms because that's it that's an interesting switch
*  Well in the beginning there wasn't very good switch, you know
*  It's like one of the reasons why the early episode sucked. It's like I didn't know what I was doing
*  And I didn't think anybody was listening
*  It was just for fun and there was a lot of just hanging out with comics and just doing what comics do if we're at
*  A diner somewhere just talking shit and making each other laugh
*  But we were doing it and videotaping it and then along the way I started interviewing
*  actual interesting people and talking to them and having conversations and not
*  You know, I don't you know either's a place for comedy and then I don't I make a really
*  Big point in never trying to force comedy into places where it doesn't belong
*  That's the I do that also with the UFC when I do commentary. I'm never funny
*  There's no reason to be it's not when my job is, you know
*  And then when I'm doing a conversation with someone I just try to talk I don't try to be a comic
*  I don't try just I'm a human
*  I want and I want to know what they're talking about and I want to I want to get them to expand upon their ideas
*  As best as I can and I want to be engaged that's what I'm trying to do
*  So it wasn't that it wasn't that was a big transition
*  It was that I had to learn how to do this thing that I didn't think was a skill
*  I thought that like being on the radio or podcasting, you know was just talking that's what I thought
*  It's like you're just talking and then I realized no no, you're talking in a way that people want to listen
*  You're making it entertaining. You're keeping your ego in check
*  You're you're moving the conversation along when not being overbearing you're not letting people ramble too much where it's boring you you got to figure out how to
*  Juice things up and push them and massage them and move them around
*  It's a skill and I didn't think it was a skill and you know
*  And like I said, that's one of the reasons why my early episode sucked
*  So bad there wasn't even any consideration to the fact that people were listening. It was just fun
*  We're just doing it for ourselves and then along the way and this actually also speaks to the value of criticism
*  I read a bunch of criticism about what was wrong with the podcast, you know that I talk we talk over each other
*  I talked too much whatever it was and I took it to heart and I would think about it
*  I'll go. Okay, I got to consider that people are listening to this. This isn't just what I want to say
*  It's what I want people to hear and how I want it just like stand-up
*  You wanted the joke to easily enter into a person's mind
*  So it's so well written and so perfectly timed that the audience goes john stewart's got this
*  I'm just going to sit back and let him take my thoughts on a ride
*  And that's that's what really good stand-up is. I mean, it's one of the reasons why dave was able to do that
*  Uh 846 special that way where he has this long
*  Drawn out story with so many important points and a few laughs thrown in there but so engaged
*  And it's he's so you you just go with him. You just let him take you just let him take you and that's
*  that's
*  everything whether it's someone giving a speech or you know, I mean even like
*  just
*  Almost every conversation that we have it's there's a skill to it that we're not taught
*  I mean, you know what? It's like to talk to someone where they're not even really talking to you
*  They're just kind of waiting for them to talk. They're waiting for you to finish so they can talk about themselves
*  That's that's a real problem with people and communicating and I had to learn how to I learned how to be a better communicator
*  Really and also how to be?
*  authentically you because there is now like I think the best measure sometimes of of art or a
*  Stand-up or those things is when you you hear things or see things that are
*  Uniquely that person like nobody could have delivered 846 the day right? Perfect. Yeah
*  It just authentically uniquely
*  Him your voice that you develop authentically uniquely and that's a hard thing to develop
*  It's funny because I feel like that's what stand-up helped to do for me
*  Hmm, that's when you do that in front of our eyes even I'll give like boss as an example
*  You know when we'd be working next you do that that run of nix is like the Framingham and the other ones
*  You know, we go to the the one in in central Boston first
*  And I can remember
*  I hadn't played the room before and I was I was a young comic and I just done letterman
*  I think I'd gotten like a big break
*  and so the guys at next booked me on that run to be a
*  Headline of my first run on those next properties
*  So I came into nix and they were just going to throw me up on stage and what they did
*  Was so such a learning experience because you kind of think like i'm on letterman
*  I'm just going to walk into this place. I'm coming up from new york top better comedy
*  I'm gonna fucking strut my stuff at nix
*  And they threw up before me
*  I think it was Lenny Clark
*  Kenny Rodgerson and Sweeney
*  And I walked down the room and it was like dresden like they had so
*  Blown that room out with brilliance and then it was like and uh from new york a letterman guy
*  john stupe and
*  it was
*  it was like
*  They were clubbing a baby seal. I was just
*  Man they did that to everybody
*  But so like wonderfully humbling. Yeah, and you because it makes you realize in a moment like all right
*  I've got a shit ton of work to do. Yes, like
*  just
*  Murder it brilliant shit
*  And they're just like oh boy
*  yeah, if you want to be humbled that the
*  Boston comedy scene in the late 80s in the early 90s. That was the place to be
*  It was a great place to develop too though because it lets you know
*  I mean you never want to be overconfident
*  It's one of the worst things you could be in anything and you never want to be lazy if you're especially when you're delivering something
*  To people that are actually paying to see you talk
*  right like man, there's such a
*  There's such a important
*  Connection that you have to those people it is got it. You've got to do the work
*  it's got to be your best version and
*  If you're not doing that and they know you're not doing that they get angry at you
*  It's like it's the anger that an audience has towards a comic that's bombing is very difficult to describe
*  You know like they're mad they can do that too
*  They can talk too like why the fuck are you talking like if you're not on and you know
*  There's real valuable lessons to that as a comic coming up that you do apply to whether it's podcasting or hosting any kind of a show
*  Yeah, no, there's a fragility to it. And if you don't stay on top of it, you know
*  The energy that room is it is a bear that will get up and walk out of the room
*  Uh, if you're not careful, but it's interesting also though now so you're known now
*  Stand up when you're known versus stand up when you're not is also a different experience
*  Because you walk into a room when they know you and there is
*  you know
*  You don't have to be as sharp if you don't want to because that and that's a discipline as well
*  Yeah, I mean or that you're not coasting on
*  Maybe some goodwill that they had for you based on something else. That's very dangerous
*  That's one of the reasons why the comedy store is so important because when I go there, it's not my crowd
*  It's my crowd and you know
*  Uh, anthony jesselnyx crowd and alley wong's crowd and like there's a lot of people there coming to see everybody
*  And so and you're going on after all these murderers
*  So it's when you're when you're in that kind of an environment you sort of have to dot your eyes and cross your t's
*  You got to do the work
*  Right. Are you still really involved like because for me, you know
*  Once I did started the show and once I had kids like I don't really get to the clubs anymore
*  So it it almost feels like old timers day when I show up like
*  You know, uh
*  But I wish I I wish I could get out there more every night it would be you know, it'd be like eight o'clock
*  I'd be like, oh shit
*  I should just
*  Drive up to the city and go work the cellar and then my wife will be like bachelor in paradise is on all right
*  Yeah, well the way I had been setting it up at the store was all my sets would be after 10 o'clock for the most part
*  Except rarely rarely I would do an eight o'clock show. So everybody would be in bed
*  So i'd leave my house and my set wouldn't be probably until 11
*  So i'd leave my house and everybody would be asleep and it was perfect
*  And I just and I that's also my favorite time to write too. I would come home from the store and everybody would be asleep
*  Fire up a joint and sit in front of the laptop and come up with some ideas and it's I had it down to a science
*  before the the lockdown
*  right
*  Has the lockdown messed with your routine are you a creature? I don't know. I don't know. I mean I mean
*  My comedy routine it certainly has I don't know. I mean i'm doing my first shows this weekend in houston
*  I don't know what the fuck's gonna happen. I don't know if I know how to do it anymore
*  It's gonna be very strange
*  Houston is like you you couldn't go more into the belly of the beast like right now. Yeah
*  Like it's like being on the surface of venus like it's off the charts with this thing
*  Yeah, i'm gonna go on stage with two bottles of lysol and just you know
*  Girls do that thing when they spray perfume and they walk through it. I'm gonna do that with lysol on stage
*  A little bit on the
*  I mean, I think it's really critical to strengthen your immune system
*  And I do a lot of things to do that and I think that that's something that people need to really concentrate on
*  and I really wish that our elected officials were talking more about that and having speeches with doctors and
*  Doing the opposite you remember shell obama tried to do like
*  Tried to put kale in something and everybody was like what the i'm sorry
*  We're going back to tater tots like that
*  Yeah
*  Yeah
*  I mean just the science on vitamin supplementation and how critical it is for your immune system, particularly vitamin d
*  That is that could literally save lives and that knowledge is not secret that knowledge is out there
*  you did the those those episodes on the game changers the uh,
*  james wooks and that was it was fascinating to watch because I I watched that movie and
*  You know nutrition is also like diet is such an important part of
*  What we do to ourselves that we that we don't think and especially in a time of covet
*  where
*  so many people like you say like when you see what this does to people with type 1 diabetes or or
*  with other kinds of uh,
*  you know conditions that might be caused from either poor diet or lack of access to uh,
*  You know healthier options and things like that you realize like shit we've put ourselves
*  In a very vulnerable position. Yeah, very vulnerable
*  But now we andrew schultz had a really good point. He said this this pandemic
*  highlighted the vulnerabilities both in our economic system
*  And in our health system like the way we are as human beings the what who who's vulnerable the obese people people with diabetes older folks
*  I mean it it it highlights all these issues where you know
*  We we really need to concentrate on for the future if you want more people to survive this
*  There is there are strategies that can be implemented and we really we really need to talk to people about
*  Just being normal stuff being dehydrated being well hydrated making sure you're not dehydrated well rested
*  Um teach people meditation techniques. It's not hard to learn some breathing exercises that have been actually proven to
*  Increase your immune function. It's not hard to teach people about vitamin d and supplementing it if you can't go outside
*  So how do you get people then to take action?
*  Because here's the other thing you remember like people's lives are hard. Yeah
*  You're dealing when you're talking about like what we talked about earlier like economic inequality
*  You know
*  It's hard to go into an area where they feel like shit. I don't know where my next meal is coming from and be like
*  So here's what we're going to do. We're just going to sit and breathe quietly for five minutes and everything's going
*  No, it's a really difficult. It's like hierarchy of needs, you know
*  how do you
*  How do you work into the idea that those types of theories are actually important to?
*  The betterment of like and the stability of the larger part of their life when they're fighting so hard just to stay afloat
*  Yeah, it's a that's an interesting
*  Point and uh, I think what you have to do is it it has to be first of all
*  Told by people who are doing it successfully
*  so people that are doing it that like maybe were struggling with their immune system and
*  Turned it around and got healthier like those people are the ones that the people that are in a bad position right now
*  They really respond to when it comes to like there's an emotional connection with some if you see some guy is on the cover
*  Of men's health magazine. He's ripped and he starts talking about fitness. He's like get the fuck out of here
*  I can't relate to you. I'm never going to look like that
*  But if you see someone who is in this situation that you're in currently and they turned it around
*  You already look like that. Well, not me, but listen i've been working out my whole life. I've never stopped
*  But if someone is fat i'm talking from their perspective and they see some guy who's really thin and chiseled
*  Then it's not going to make sense to them that they could ever be like that
*  but if they see someone there's a lot of really fantastic photos and and and
*  Instagram and facebook pages online where you can get inspiration from someone who actually stuck to a diet actually stuck to an exercise routine
*  And then speaks really well about how much it improved the way they feel their emotions their depression
*  All the aspects of their life and that's I think one of the more like david goggons is a great example that I use
*  Him all the time because he's this incredibly inspirational guy who was a navy seal and at one point in time
*  He's 300 pounds. He was drinking milkshakes and he puts those pictures of himself on instagram all the time just to let people know
*  Hey, i'm not some alien. I'm i'm a person who is weak just like you. I was lazy
*  I got fat and then I figured out how to train my mind to be disciplined and I figured out how to be happier
*  And I think that that's really important for people to see that
*  It's we're not in a static state. We're all in a constant state of improvement and growth, hopefully or deterioration if you're not careful
*  But does that you know the thing that I worry about those sometimes is similarly to economic distress
*  Does it make a person's health be a function of their virtue?
*  Does it does it take something that is beyond a lot of people's control that isn't that a little bit of like?
*  Hey, man, if you just pull your pants up you you could do it like no, it's not it's not what it is
*  On the way, I know what you're saying, but it's not it's I did this and I can show you how I did it
*  And maybe you can do it too. That's what it is
*  We don't have to look at every success as somehow or another thumbing in the face of people who can't achieve a similar goal
*  But but there are enough people out there that can
*  That we should concentrate on that because I think it'll have a significant improvement on the overall health of us again as a community
*  And I think this is really how we have to look at the the the united states and human beings on earth in general
*  We have to look at each other as a bunch of people that could very well be neighbors
*  We're we're a community and if you're my friend and you were fat and you were willing to listen
*  And I used to be fat too and I can tell you hey man. This is what I did. I stopped drinking soda
*  What's up? There are people that are there are people that are jim
*  I mean, I understand the point there and I'm look i'm an advocate for plant-based stuff
*  I think that's it's a healthy way to do it
*  Uh, but obviously eating is such a personal experience that I hesitate to ever
*  uh impart that in any other way, but
*  I just feel like
*  Sometimes for people it's almost more debilitating for that mentality of
*  This is how you do it. You just got to get your shit together and and go through this way
*  I do think you have to present
*  More options, but know that it's maybe more complicated and people can be
*  Overweight or whatever and be healthy
*  It's not necessarily
*  You know something that's corrosive to them, but well it is though being overweight is necessarily corrosive. It's not healthy for anybody
*  It's less healthy
*  Than being at an optimal weight. That's what's important. It gives you some sort of a burden whether that burden is sustainable
*  Is debatable maybe for some people it is for some people it isn't look some people can smoke until they're 90 and they're fine
*  Other people get pancreatic cancer like hicks and die in their 30s
*  It it it depends wildly on the person
*  But the idea that you can be fat and you can be healthy I think is a dangerous narrative because you're telling people
*  Listen, don't improve. You don't have to you can be healthy and be obese at the same time, but the medical
*  Science does not really support that
*  The more weight you lose up to a certain point, you know
*  But when you if you get to a healthy body mass your body works better
*  It's really simple. It doesn't tax your immune system as much doesn't tax your heart as much. It's better for you
*  It's better for your joints
*  um, it doesn't mean that we should ignore people that are overweight and
*  You know and pretend that you know that they're they're not worthy or they're not
*  They're not good folks. I definitely I have a very emotional reaction to that because I feel protective
*  You're nice over people and I I just yeah, I think you're a sweetheart. It's great
*  That's a good thing. No, it is. It's the the reason why you're thinking like this because we're talking
*  Right, we're talking about people doing well and you're like fuck. What about the people who can't do well?
*  Let's reach out to them and offer them an olive branch and yeah, I get it man. I guess you're you're right
*  You're right. Look, I have very good friends that are morbidly obese and they don't want to listen and there's nothing I can do
*  I just hug them when I see them and you know
*  I hope that one day they come to grips with it and they change but they don't have to
*  You know you you live this life for a certain amount of time
*  And if you want to live it eating cake and drinking beer, that's you you do whatever you want
*  We're all on the end in the end. We're all going to be in the ground. It's all pointless
*  Wait a minute we just had an hour-long conversation
*  About
*  Optimistically taking this country and turning it around and got very fatalistic all of a sudden
*  Well, that's true the end in the end. We're all dying. That's how the story ends. We're all dead
*  So the the story what I don't want people to do is suffer and I want people to feel better while they're alive
*  And I think that's something that's missed in the message of health improvement
*  Like you will actually have a better experience on earth and it'll help you mitigate stress. It'll help you
*  It'll help you have better relationships because you won't be burdened down with a lot of like anxiety and stress that literally comes from a
*  Physical release of energy I look at the body like a battery and I think that some people's battery is just over
*  Flowing with corrosive material because they never exert it
*  They never blow it out a battery a battery is a bad analogy, but there's there's a certain amount of physical requirement
*  I think your body has to has and if you don't give that that body that physical exertion
*  It doesn't feel good where we've evolved to hunt and gather and build homes and survive from predators
*  And we carry around all the burdens in our body of this past
*  And there's no getting around that and you can either deny it and just deal with all the tension or you can exert your energy
*  Find some way to calm your mind and live a life. That's better
*  Let me ask you a question that because now this is
*  A question that I'm wondering because you're talking about sort of evolving to a place where your body and like when you had james on
*  and he was talking about
*  Planet do you have
*  Moral qualms about meat or do you not like you said well, you know
*  We're hunters and and that like is that ever an issue for you or is it purely a health issue or is it?
*  There's both things. Um, there's a health issue. There is a moral qualm with factory farming
*  There's not a moral qualm qualm with health with hunting because I know the reality of the life of a deer
*  If you don't kill that deer
*  It's going to die a horrible death from a wolf or a coyote or a mountain lion or whatever the fuck gets a hold of it
*  It's going to freeze to death
*  It's going you can either die quickly by the hand of a person you respect that life and it'll nurture your body and the bodies
*  Of your family our problem is a disconnection more than anything and let me tell you something when the covet lockdown happened
*  I got more requests from friends and more requests for information about hunting and gun ownership
*  How do I protect myself and how do I feed myself and how do I grow food?
*  Those were three really big questions that I kept getting from people
*  it's funny, I have such a different perspective on it in terms of just the
*  um
*  The relationship between myself and I didn't I was a big meat eater. It's a big like deli guy
*  Kastrami and corned beef and all that my wife
*  Uh got into rescue and these types of things and we ended up with a farm with pigs and goats and sheep and things like that and
*  It became
*  Untenable for me to make that decision, you know that
*  That's sort of that decision of uh, I think you'll be better off
*  If I kill you and it became
*  It was something I could no longer
*  manage once I knew
*  The process of it
*  And that it was a hard it's been a very hard
*  Process for me. It's only been about four or five years. How is your health?
*  um
*  I mean i'm an old jew so
*  baseline
*  pretty much
*  Uh, we don't age well to begin with
*  How old are you now john? We age a bit like avocados when you leave them out. Um
*  I'm 57
*  I'm 52
*  So we're in similar boats similar boat. Yeah, uh, but
*  I mean, it's it's hard to know. I feel good
*  You know if you look at markers like cholesterol or blood pressure those things it's better
*  But like you say I don't I don't know enough about how the body
*  Processes to know if i'm I feel better the numbers say i'm better
*  I'm better
*  But you know genetics i'm sure plays a part in it as well, but the funny thing is like
*  I don't even think about it anymore
*  Like I just don't even think about it anymore. Well, once you get into a custom and once your gut biome changes
*  You know, you really get accustomed to whatever you're eating good or bad, unfortunately
*  And that's one of the reasons why people have such a hard time quitting sugar and bread and pasta and things along those lines
*  So your body just craves it. That's what it wants
*  When you start eating healthier food your body does crave that
*  Can go off of meat and still be incredibly unhealthy like, you know, you can be vegan and just exist on lays potato chips
*  Right. Yeah, fine. So it is, you know, and it and it's a tougher road and the world is certainly not
*  uh
*  It's not built for that and it's it certainly feels a little bit
*  uh
*  Of a narrower lane that you have to do and I also think it's an incredibly emotional topic
*  Yeah, like very little that's as emotional and personal
*  as what people put in their bodies and how they eat and what they do and i'm always very respectful because I also
*  I got no leg to stand on man. I like this is what i'm doing. It feels better for me, but I
*  I always say like but
*  It's such a personal and individual choice and you everybody's got to do for themselves
*  The only thing I would say is like I do think it's important for people to get educated on it
*  to read up on like you say factory farming or what might be the
*  you know
*  Nutritional cost of it or what are some of the things that are in it or what maybe is it going to do to our immunity?
*  When you know, we use so many antibiotics
*  the meat production
*  I the only that's the only thing I say is like
*  Try and educate yourself
*  To how your meal gets to your table. That's why i'm a huge advocate for like
*  Local farming and agriculture because those are the people they're just growing their food and they're bringing it to your table
*  I I find that incredible but
*  but I also don't I try not to take a position of
*  Judgment on people because I feel like that's unfair
*  Well, I think that's very wise of you
*  And I think that there's a lot of people that share your position on animal death
*  And I think that's one of the more promising aspects of laboratory created meat as long as it can be done in a way
*  That's actually going to be healthy for us
*  It seems like there's some real science behind that and they're very very close to releasing that on large scale
*  So it would be actual meat that doesn't come with death, which is really fascinating. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah
*  You're talking about like the the the one that they had I saw like it's a tank and he pulls out
*  It's like $20,000 for a chicken breast that they did that. Yeah, it was really expensive at one point in time
*  but they've gotten it down to a burger now like they can actually make a burger out of this stuff and
*  They feel like as this this technology improves they essentially flesh when it's not
*  Would you if you could if you could still have?
*  The the part of meat that you like but it came without death
*  Do you think you would make that switch or is that something that?
*  Well, I certainly would with domestic animals
*  The the difference between that and hunting there's uh, there's a conservation aspect of it
*  um one thing that leads to
*  Uh protection of wildlife habitat is actually the money that comes from hunting tags and hunting equipment
*  um, there's that uh, there's also
*  the the type of
*  Relationship you have with your food when you actually work
*  Very hard and hunt it and kill it is very different than buying food from a store
*  And I I would say similar in a similar way growing whole food when you go to whole food
*  Sometimes you really got to stop that. You know, there's there's a lot that goes into the trip to whole foods. Yeah
*  It's hard to find a good parking spot
*  That's right. Yeah, I get it. Um
*  Growing your own food in your backyard is very satisfying too and I would say to people like that's a micro
*  Cosm like it's a very micro form of what it feels like to hunt an animal and then eat it and feed your family
*  For you know, if I shoot an elk, I eat it literally for a year
*  so one animal death equals like a year of my meals and um,
*  You know, there's also the moral high ground position
*  You know, I think a lot of people love to look at the moral high ground of eating vegetables and only eating vegetables
*  As being a superior way to live their life and that's that's a good decision
*  I understand where you're coming from
*  I understand that there's people that look at life very differently than me. They maybe don't have the sort of
*  fatalistic perspective even though it's respectful. I have a very fatalistic
*  perspective when it comes to just all organic organisms competing for uh resources and
*  For life these animals. I mean i've run into them when they've killed each other
*  I've seen animals that have been taken out by other animals
*  I've come across their bodies torn apart by wolves in in the woods
*  It's a wild wild thing out there man
*  And I think we're so insulated by it in the in our culture of today
*  That it's one of the reasons why veganism and all these things are becoming so attractive
*  I would hope that along with that we're going to be nicer to each other that we're going to be we're going to grow
*  To be a kinder human race. I really I really hope that
*  Yeah, because I think it's it's about consideration, you know for me
*  I think it was there was a certain part of consciousness that I never ascribed
*  To animals to some extent. It's funny because I always thought of myself as oh, I you know, I love animals
*  I you know always had dogs and cats and you know
*  You'd find a bird with a broken wing and you stick him in a box and two weeks later. He flies away and you're a hero
*  But I never really ascribed like individuality to them and I think that was the change for me
*  was
*  interacting
*  In an individual way on your farm on the farm. Yeah, you know, I always did tell my brother once once we named them
*  Yeah, you watch them like they're played though. They'll play or they and it it just changed my relationship
*  To what I wanted it to be with
*  Animals and it it just made it untenable in that moment
*  For me, but I truly understand like that that is in
*  A really
*  Individualized personalized experience that that that I made and like I say
*  I would love it for people to make that connection because I think it's profound there is
*  There is something about that connection for people that when they do see it, you know, it's funny. I'll talk about
*  the pigs and they'll be like
*  what
*  you know
*  They just eat everything. They're like, no, they're really playful. They're smart
*  Don't dogs you do belly rubs. Yeah, it's it's but that was shocking to me. I didn't know that I just thought
*  Oh, it's like a blob
*  Beings we're talking about nature john and there's nothing natural about a farm. That's part of the problem
*  I mean, it's all it's an animal prison and they're domesticated because we give them food and we kind of remove the
*  The natural fear that they would have of any, you know
*  Eyeball facing forward predator, which is what we are
*  You know what's interesting about too their health
*  Like what having our farm with sheep and goats and pigs and they're all rescues
*  Is like having a nursing home
*  like you can't believe the fragility of
*  factory farmed animals like they are
*  to be
*  sick like pneumonia, uh
*  like
*  Genetically designed to gain too much weight for their legs. It really is
*  you know the island of misfit to like they they've genetically modded or done whatever they've done and and
*  the health
*  Of these animals that are in our food supply. Yeah that our mainstay of our food supply is really suspect
*  Yeah, that's why
*  Nursing home. Yeah, that's why I prefer hunting the when if you're eating an animal that's a wild animal
*  You're eating an athlete. I mean they're they're sinewy and thick and they're strong and
*  They've survived and they're so much more nutrient dense
*  When you're when you're talking about factory farmed animals, you're talking about I mean
*  Factory farmed animals is the worst version of what human beings are capable of they were capable of ignoring suffering to the point
*  We lock them all in warehouses
*  Their piss goes down in a tunnel and fills a small lake up and they've flown over these places with drones
*  It's horrific right the pig farms in particular. They're horrific
*  But when you're talking about what you're doing on your farm, of course, you can't eat those things
*  They're your pets that would be I mean you're naming them and feeding them and touching them
*  But I extrapolate that now so I I think what happened was I went. Oh, right
*  That's in the same way that like I love my dog
*  But if you have a dog
*  I wouldn't kill your dog and right because I look at dogs now in a different way. So I think I extrapolate to
*  The animal kingdom in a way a different I have it I feel like because of my wife and she's been she's
*  A much kinder smarter version of me. So uh
*  Because of her kind of showing me that relationship and experiencing myself like it's just changed the way
*  That I view it and that's been and it kind of takes us back around to the earlier part of the conversation
*  Because when you think about animal agriculture and you talk about those hog farms, where are they located?
*  They're located in the poorest neighborhoods, right?
*  They locate and the environmental damage that they do is also damage that's done to
*  Poor rural communities that live around them now. I'm not suggesting that there's not economic
*  There's an economic incentive in it and an industry around it and certainly not, you know, you don't just end industries
*  but
*  reform again like it
*  it's sort of like uh
*  george p bush said this he was talking about donald trump because
*  I'm going to support donald trump because donald trump is the only thing standing between america and socialism
*  and I was like
*  The only thing standing between america and socialism is an inability to meaningfully reform capitalism
*  And it's more damaging effects and if we can't do that
*  Then the people take to the streets
*  I think reform
*  Like bernie was talking about those other guys that will save capitalism that will save democracy
*  By showing that we recognize that there is collateral damage to the systems that we use
*  To gain wealth and to gain power and if we can reform those systems meaningfully
*  For the people who suffer most terribly under them
*  We save it, but if we can't
*  The bastille gets stormed like that's just what kennedy said if you make peaceful evolution impossible
*  You make violent revolution inevitable. Yeah, so we I think at some point we have to demonstrate the will and the stamina
*  To be able to attack these problems and that's why i'm voting joe rogan
*  Yeah, no, I think everyone agrees but everyone feels like their hands are tied and again
*  I think that's one of the reasons why these protests and just this this whole explosion after george floyd has been so
*  Transformative I think because people recognize like this is a real moment of change and of course
*  Opportunists and looters and all kinds of other crazy shit happened along the way
*  But it's it speaks to the fact that there's so many people in the street. It speaks it speaks to this
*  This like we can actually do something now. We've got momentum. Let's keep it moving
*  Are you hopeful? Yes. I'm always hopeful. I'm very optimistic even though I have a fatalistic perspective
*  exact same
*  in these terrible times, how do you remain hopeful i'm like
*  because
*  Better people outnumber shitty people. Yes, I long shop they do
*  That's just the truth. They really do
*  powerless sometimes we may
*  Act out of fear or resource whatever that is
*  Better people outnumber shitty people by a long time and we're in an adolescent stage of our
*  Evolution of as a civilization it's growing and changing there's never been a civilization like us today
*  And we're growing and changing to try to suit our real sensibilities and to try to to try to get better at this fucking thing
*  And and not just accept this old crazy corrupt structure that's existed forever
*  Thank you. Yeah, you put a little fire in my belly good like this
*  around doing the thing but like uh, I've I've really enjoyed
*  Uh, i've really enjoyed the conversation. Listen man. I always enjoyed talking to you. I appreciate you very much
*  And I don't get to see you enough
*  All right, my friend and uh, hopefully when this all ends, uh, everybody can gather again at the
*  You know at the store and have do a good set and talk some shit with each other and have some fun. Let's do it brother
*  Take care my friend and good luck with your film irresistible is out when now
*  uh
*  Tomorrow tomorrow
*  John Stewart, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you my brother. Thank you, sir. Bye
*  You
