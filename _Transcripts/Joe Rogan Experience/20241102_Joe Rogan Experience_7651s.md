# Joe Rogan Experience #2222 - John Fetterman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y-59phRHRM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day.
*  All right, well, we're rolling.
*  What's happening?
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Oh, hey, man.
*  It's awesome to be here, man.
*  Really.
*  Yeah, like I got to say hi to my son.
*  He's just so thrilled.
*  He's like, you know, he's 15 and he literally freaked out.
*  Like, oh my God, and all of his friends are going to definitely be watching too.
*  What's his name?
*  Yeah.
*  What's his name?
*  Carl with a K. And I met a guy, I met a guy who's like, I'm going to be a good friend
*  of his.
*  I'm going to be a good friend of his.
*  I'm going to be a good friend of his.
*  I'm going to be a good friend of his.
*  I met a Carl in the lobby, but it's a C, but.
*  That's not a human, a non-human Carl.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what's up, human Carl?
*  So first of all, are you the only guy that figured out that you don't have to wear suits
*  when you're a senator?
*  Yeah, no, it's, it's, I'm sorry, what was that?
*  I said, are you the only guy that figured out that you don't have to wear suits as a
*  senator?
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, no.
*  Well, I know it might, it seems strange, but it's like, I mean, I'm a, I'm a, I'm
*  a bigger guy and I don't really can't afford custom anyway.
*  And I hate, I'm claustrophobic and I hate them being in that kind of shit.
*  And I've always dressed like, like shit.
*  And, you know, and I know, and then that whole thing kind of got away of us.
*  People assume that there was a dress code issue there.
*  And I'm like, no, I wasn't behind that, behind that.
*  But of course everybody pointed at the, at the dude that dresses like a slob.
*  And then the whole, the whole nation just had like a meltdown, like, oh my God, the
*  Senate's on fire because I dress like a slob.
*  But, but my life is just much better in DC that unless that I'm going to be on the floor
*  that I'm not going to be, you're never going to see me in a suit.
*  And I think that's a more authentic kind of way that I live.
*  And I don't judge anybody on how they dress or those things.
*  I just dress this way.
*  And there's also practical issues as well, too.
*  Like I have, I have chopstick legs and I have no ass and I can't keep pants up.
*  And hoodies, and hoodies, it's like I don't have to iron that shit.
*  You know, so it's just like easy, it's comfort.
*  And it's like, I just feel like that's, I mean, and if somebody judged me, and people have
*  said that, but it's like I'd rather have somebody know.
*  And I promise you, a lot of people and dudes, especially in Western Pennsylvania, love to
*  wear suits all year.
*  I mean, excuse me, shorts all year and dress like that.
*  But to me, it's about comfort and practical.
*  Well, I mean, it makes sense.
*  The whole dress code thing of wearing suits and you're more serious because you have
*  certain clothing on, it seems pretty silly.
*  Sorry, what's that?
*  So let's tell everybody what's going on with your iPad.
*  So because you had a stroke, you have difficulty, do you have difficulty hearing or?
*  Well, no, I can hear just perfectly right now.
*  And, but there's just the one kind of a lingering issue.
*  There's a lingering issue.
*  And sometimes I lose just a couple steps on time.
*  And then now after that, that's the only thing.
*  And thankfully the stroke never touched my intellect.
*  Thanks.
*  But the stroke nearly killed me.
*  And again, I don't.
*  But I use captioning in situations just like this in interviews.
*  So that's why I can really make sure exactly what's being said.
*  And then I can able to just participate.
*  If somebody wears the glasses, it doesn't mean that they're illiterate.
*  It just means that's a tool that allows them to participate or drive or those things.
*  And it's that same thing.
*  And a lot of people across America use captioning to watch movies and TV.
*  And that's really no different than that.
*  So it doesn't affect your intellect, but it does affect your hearing.
*  Is that what's going on?
*  No, I can hear and I can listen to music.
*  The difference with music, for example, is that as long as there's muscle memory,
*  I can remember all those kinds of music things.
*  But it seems unlikely at this point that is there not going to be any kind of new,
*  new favorites emerging like that.
*  So you essentially can listen to the same old music forever?
*  Yeah, no, it's yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean, all of the all the classics like, you know, Metallica, Motorhead,
*  Motorhead, The Cult, all those kinds of things like I haven't lost any of the Def Lep and those things.
*  Well, I saw the the the record of Whiter, excuse me, Whitesnake.
*  But all those things. Yeah, I know.
*  I mean, I think we're both in the 50s, right?
*  And we grew up with the crew and all those kinds of things.
*  So some people might judge me based on my my taste on music.
*  But I mean, that's that's kind of where.
*  Listen, people are going to judge you no matter what.
*  You're a big giant guy, wears hoodies and you're a senator.
*  So no matter what, they're going to judge you.
*  Who cares?
*  But I'm just trying to understand what is going on with the captioning,
*  because you you can hear.
*  But so there's some sort of a disconnect between hearing and understanding.
*  Like, what is it? Yeah, I wouldn't say it's necessarily disconnect.
*  It's just it's it's just about being precise.
*  Just to make sure that so if you know, like for an interview, just to make make sure of those things.
*  So it's really just about captioning.
*  It just really is just a tool. No difference.
*  I mean, for this, this is like my my eyes in the sense for glasses that just.
*  Right. I understand.
*  So it just gives you a little bit more precision in what you're saying.
*  Yeah. And understanding what was it like running for senator right after recovering from a stroke?
*  That had to be a nightmare.
*  Yeah, I don't recommend that.
*  I don't recommend that because you seem to have recovered quite a bit since then.
*  Oh, yeah. No. But during that time, you were really struggling.
*  Oh, sure. Absolutely.
*  Absolutely. Like it was it was it was a rough conversation after that.
*  They they brought me into the hospital and then I went under and then I I woke up and they said they said, hey, we got it.
*  We got it. We got the clot.
*  The clot that that essentially just killed me.
*  And I'm like, oh, that's good.
*  And then just kind of went back under.
*  And at that point, I had no idea where we were at on those things.
*  And then I had the next morning I woke up and then they a doctor came on and he had kind of a grim kind of a look on his face and things.
*  And my dad was there sitting next to me at the bed.
*  And I was like, well, hey, Doc, I mean, what's what things what do you think?
*  What do you like? And he's like, well, you know, your your your heart is functioning at an incredibly low kinds of percentage.
*  And and I'm like, well, well, well, what do you what do you think?
*  And he was like, well, you know, I mean, there's some issues.
*  And I'm like, well, are we talking, you know, maybe a year, a year kind of thing.
*  And and and I'm like, and this is all while you were running for Senate.
*  Yeah, yeah. This was this was after this was after this was after this was three days before the primary.
*  Oh, my God. I was on my I was on my way to an event.
*  And and my wife, Giselle, she she's like, you're you're having a stroke because they had that classic kinds of where, you know, half of my face.
*  I didn't know that, but it kind of just, you know, just slumped.
*  Yeah. And and and they hotline me over to the hospital.
*  And I wouldn't I wouldn't have survived if we were in a different.
*  I mean, there's parts of Pennsylvania and that's it. That's part of the tragic that if I wasn't close to the kinds of hospital that I was,
*  it's 100 percent that I wouldn't have survived that.
*  Wow. And it got me there in enough time.
*  And they were able to there was an expert there.
*  And I actually had I met that doctor that's that literally saved my life.
*  And I'm like, oh, my God.
*  And he usually wasn't based in that hospital. He was usually out of Delaware.
*  But he happened to be there. And and that and he was here to give me an award for being that kind of an advocate for those things.
*  I'm like, oh, you you deserve you deserve the award on that.
*  And and that's incredibly lucky.
*  Yeah. And and then and then I asked, really looking for like a countdown of like, well, what's the prognosis?
*  And and I really there wasn't much there on that.
*  And I had to like, was I going to survive for long or, you know, what's that going to look?
*  And then, of course, the entire majority on the Senate really was on the middle of that.
*  And that's a big responsibility after that.
*  And then so the the primary it happened.
*  And I actually had a really strong win.
*  And I won all of 67 counties, Pennsylvania, 67 counties.
*  And we carried every county, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and all across Pennsylvania.
*  But at that point, I had a responsibility. It's like, am I able to recover or where a kind of when am I going to be OK?
*  And I wouldn't recommend being in that situation.
*  I made a commitment more than anything.
*  I was more worried about being being around to be a dad.
*  I mean, I have three I have three young kids and my my wife, you know, she lived through all of this.
*  So at that at that point, it started I was in the hospital for about 10 days.
*  And yeah, and I start to get better and better.
*  The strength started to come back a little bit, but it was still rough.
*  And it was very, very clear, though, that I had a capacity to it's been impaired on on hearing and those kinds of interaction and those things.
*  So but but but that's the thing.
*  But but I had to decide by August 15th.
*  And that's actually that's my birthday, ironically, that if I step down by then or before,
*  then they're going to have to find somebody to replace me on the primary.
*  And that was going to be my drop my drop out day on that.
*  So what was the operation? How did they do it?
*  How did they remove the clot? Well, it's it's I mean, I had to originally I had to go back to I have to learn how to how to talk and speak.
*  You know, I went to a speech therapist and have interaction and those kinds of things.
*  And my hearing and those kinds of things were still impacted by that.
*  And they had to monitor my heart because it was it effectively stopped.
*  I found out after the fact that it actually stopped and then that my heart had to recover.
*  So there was two kinds of things working there.
*  You know, my heart and then right before the primary, they walked in and they said, well, here, here's what I suggest.
*  Here's what I suggest.
*  Now, we are going to put a pacemaker.
*  We're going to put in a pacemaker and and we're like, hey, that's that's the best thing.
*  So they put that device right here.
*  And for anyone, if you're not really what that is, a pacemaker.
*  But that that that manages your heart, you know, because I had a significant issue with a fib.
*  And that's really what what did that to my heart.
*  And they put that in and then that was that was that was right before the primary.
*  And they put me under and I what year was this?
*  This was twenty two twenty twenty two.
*  And before you had this stroke, had you ever had any issues before with clotting or anything like it was just not with clotting, not with clotting.
*  You know, my I have for good for good things and for for bad things.
*  My heart was just like my father's, you know, and he had an issue with a fib and he was in the hospital.
*  So it's a genetic genetic.
*  And but I didn't it was never an idea.
*  It was never an idea that I was going to even having a stroke.
*  That wasn't part of the at least my thinking.
*  I knew that I was in distress.
*  You know, I could tell that my heart was was was was in problem and I was just going to get through this primary.
*  I mean, there's a lot running on that.
*  And then that's it didn't work out because the stroke hit three days before.
*  And and then that forced me and that put me on an incredibly different kind of a of a path after that.
*  And so where do they go in when they're removing the clot?
*  Do they have to cut your skull open?
*  Like, how do they get it out of there?
*  They went up, they went up in your vein, in your leg, and they went up and it's just it's a remarkable technology that through your leg.
*  Yeah.
*  And they just sucked it out and they wow.
*  They actually had an X, Y, an X-ray or whatever.
*  And you could see that, hey, we got it out.
*  And I actually got to see, although I really was still kind of out of it.
*  But that was the clot that that all but took took my life.
*  And so I mean, there were a lot of things there.
*  You know, suddenly your mortality was kind of like put right there in front of it.
*  Yeah. And through that, do they have any idea what caused the clot?
*  Is there do they understand like what happened to you?
*  I'm always my grandmother had an aneurysm and it was a horrible situation.
*  They didn't find her for several hours afterwards.
*  My grandfather came home and she wasn't in the house and then he found her in the backyard.
*  She had collapsed and they gave her 72 hours to live and she lived for 12 years like that.
*  It was horrible. My grandfather had to take care of her.
*  It was it was really, really rough.
*  So I'm always like really concerned with that kind of stuff.
*  Like I don't like what causes it.
*  Do they know?
*  Yeah, well, it's.
*  I mean, I had for the first time in my life and I hope it's the last time that I'm confronted by this idea that the the doctors weren't able to provide any kinds of certainty or the go.
*  Yeah, man, you're going to be OK.
*  Things are going to be OK. That wasn't so they don't know what caused it.
*  Well, I mean, it was a fib and and and my heart weakened and the stress of the of the primary and on the ongoing kinds of issues.
*  It was already weakened about that issue earlier and everything kind of came together.
*  And I guess my heart deteriorated to the point where that caused the clot and then the clot.
*  That's what nearly took took my life.
*  So then you have to go to work.
*  So now you are an elected senator and you have to go to work in the middle of recovery.
*  Yeah, it's I think.
*  I mean, it's it's so different.
*  I had a significant responsibility to to stay in that and winning through all of those things.
*  And that's that was that was difficult enough.
*  It was an important conversation and we had to run a campaign.
*  We had to run a campaign when I was it was difficult and I wasn't working at the kind of capacity that was necessary.
*  And that's we had to run up to the 15th of August decided for going to stay in that because there's a lot riding on that.
*  And you were also competing against Dr. Oz, which was weird.
*  You know, this guy who's a celebrity doctor who's at least a little shady.
*  And it's it necessarily was the the.
*  Yeah, I think, you know, we were talking about captioning earlier right now.
*  And I think we're having an issue with some of the the captioning right now here.
*  Is it not showing up?
*  Yeah, I think there's a there's a little bit of a delay.
*  Well, maybe it's the way I said, shady. Yeah, he's a little shady.
*  Like he had been in trouble for talking about miracle diet remedies that weren't miracles at all.
*  And I believe he got brought in front of Congress.
*  So it was a little odd that that guy was running for Senate at all.
*  Was he from Pennsylvania? Yeah.
*  Well, Dr. Dr. Oz. Yeah, I think I think from a technology, I think we have to address the.
*  Is it messing up right now? Yeah, I think the captioning,
*  the captioning is running a little bit behind on. OK, so can we make some technological stop and have her?
*  Sure. Fix it. Yeah. OK, we'll have her come fix it. Yeah. OK.
*  We'll pause here, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be right back. Yeah, I think we're I think we're I think we're good to go.
*  We'll take that. Yeah, we put this on the Wi-Fi. So it's working great. All right. We're back.
*  So what I was just saying that it was odd that you were running against Dr. Oz and he was just kind of Dr. Oz.
*  Yeah, I mean, Dr. Oz. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And he's he used to be people used to thought he was like really brilliant.
*  I mean, he was he was an amazing kind of surgeon celebrity.
*  And then he turned his career into like on TV and then he started to pitch more kinds of both simple kinds of things and kind of bullshit kind of stuff.
*  Yeah. And I don't understand why somebody would would change his reputation.
*  I mean, he was really revered in that. And I was I wouldn't even be I would have been comfortable to him operate on me.
*  But but he kind of lost that.
*  And what was also pretty funny is that he clearly he lived in New Jersey.
*  And so we were like, hey, we need to use that and point out that.
*  So we just we decided early on that we're going to just like, hey, you know, it matters.
*  I mean, there's nothing wrong with living on New Jersey, but there probably is an issue if you're running for for the Senate.
*  So and I really have like an ethos is that I'm I'm not ever going to be mean and I'm not going to be personal about that.
*  So we tried to have a lot of fun with the fact that he lives in New Jersey.
*  And we just really just kept hitting him, hitting him.
*  And we had Snooki did like a cameo saying, gee, Mehmet, good luck.
*  You know, I know things are going rough now, but you're going to be able to come back to New Jersey.
*  And that got viral. And we did a lot of those viral kinds of moments.
*  And, you know, they have this thing where they have what's really penetrated and they have circles on things like what what's really part of people asking about Dr.
*  Oz. And one of the zeros, the O's was he's weird.
*  But the biggest one, New Jersey, I mean, literally, New Jersey was the biggest one.
*  Yeah, like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, even though their neighbors, they do have a bit of a rivalry.
*  Yeah, well, of course. And people have to understand that it's like it's like that funny thing.
*  And I mean, it borders with with Pennsylvania.
*  And and that it really matters. It matters.
*  Yeah. And of course, Dr. Oz was he was strange in some sense.
*  And we always try to have fun with making fun of him.
*  Are you a fan? Are you a fan of the Simpsons? Yeah.
*  Yeah. But we we matched up perfectly with Dr.
*  Nick, you know, Dr. Nick, Dr. Oz.
*  And we found all the weird shit that Dr.
*  Nick would say. And then they have a clip of Dr.
*  Oz saying those kinds of thing.
*  And and then that's that's where it was.
*  And we had a lot of fun with that and things we we all figured out.
*  Well, we have we essentially we chose to kind of empty the clip metaphorically and really start hitting him.
*  You know, we went up on TV throughout the summer and he was really put on his back
*  and he was essentially thinking you're going to take take the summer off.
*  And then our polling, we got up about 10, 11 points and things.
*  You know, if anyone's listening ever heard of the five thirty eight, you know, they they track on those those races.
*  And the highest percentage we had to win was, I think, about eighty four percent.
*  And things kept going great. Really, really great.
*  And then I had to decide on my birthday on August 15th and things were going so well.
*  And I thought things I'm like, OK, then we decided to stay on that race.
*  And that's and that's what we did.
*  And then, you know, post Labor Day when and oh, my gosh, we just got we got nuked in a way that it's never been experienced that before.
*  And then how so? What do you mean?
*  Oh, a hundred million dollars of paid media to destroy you.
*  I mean, just tear you apart every aspect of your life.
*  Hundred million dollars they spent. A hundred million dollars for a job that pays how much?
*  Yeah. Oh, oh, it came from from PACs from Dr.
*  Us Dr. Us put in 20, I think, twenty eight million dollars.
*  How crazy is that? Because like, what is Senate? What does it pay being a senator?
*  You know, pay being a senator? Yeah.
*  It's it's one hundred seventy four thousand dollars.
*  Yeah. Can I talk about this?
*  Please. I don't understand why, you know, some incredibly wealthy dudes will spend tens and tens of millions of dollars just to take that.
*  And I try to tell people there's no glamour here.
*  I just talked about that in an interview.
*  Do you think he wanted to become president? And this was like a step to be president.
*  I guess everybody wants the Iron Throne. I get it. But it's it's really not.
*  And but it also it's a different it's a different kinds of skills.
*  And it really doesn't transfer over very well on that.
*  But right now in Pennsylvania right now, David McCormick, a Connecticut man, Connecticut man, he's running in Pennsylvania and he lives in Connecticut.
*  And he's incredibly wealthy.
*  I think he's worth three or four hundred million dollars.
*  And he's spending the same race in Wisconsin.
*  They're dropping crazy. And really, like, that's an important conversation that the real problem in American politics for me is is Citizens United and unlimited money.
*  When when they decided that money is speech and now that turns the whole thing into an incredibly damaging.
*  Right now, there's been at least more than half a billion dollars, half a billion dollars on the table in Pennsylvania just for president, not not not just not just the Senate races and other House seats.
*  And I was the most at least at that point was the most expensive Senate race in history.
*  And they it was over three hundred three hundred thirty million dollars for that one seat.
*  And all of those dollars, they're spent to destroy and tear you apart.
*  And then Fox News, I was their top, top target for four months.
*  And social media and I stayed out of that.
*  I didn't enjoy it. But social media, all the conservative influencers, everything.
*  And it just tore me apart.
*  And at that point, at the end of September, it was, I mean, I couldn't get away from it.
*  And it really it's like until you've had one hundred million dollars to destroy you.
*  It's it's a it's a next level kind of thing.
*  And then everyone was they were saying, well, he's a vegetable.
*  You know, he's a retard or he's lost his his brain and all kinds of things.
*  And then that wasn't true. But but the kinds of terrible things and those kinds of very personal things.
*  And it just got incredibly ugly in a way.
*  Well, yeah, that has got to be a terrible experience to to realize that there's so much money being spent just to attack you
*  and that you're a part of this very, very large and corrupt machine that's going after you just because they want to control the state.
*  And it's a giant swing state, of course.
*  And yeah, the Senate, the whole Senate, the whole Senate was in fact, we actually we flipped that seat.
*  And that's the first time I think in the 40s or 50s that we've had two Democratic senators in Pennsylvania.
*  Usually it's been a Dem and a Republican.
*  And now because we flip that seat, that's it's mathematically it's possible to to retain the majority in the Senate.
*  But it's going to be still fairly difficult because we have Montana, very, very red state, obviously.
*  And and that's really what the Republicans have put a significant bet to make sure that they can flip Montana.
*  And then if Montana falls, then they're going to keep the majority or they're going to get the majority unless there's like a really surprise one.
*  But that it may be more kind of difficult.
*  Do you think that money is the biggest problem in American politics, this ability to spend insane amounts of money?
*  Yeah, I mean, just imagine if you were a movie studio and you're putting out you're going to put out a movie and a rival studio has one hundred million dollars to tell America that movie sucks.
*  That's shit. And it's crazy.
*  And it's it's it's just there's always going to be unlimited money because it's all about the control of the Senate or the House or the presidency.
*  And when when money is is speech, it's going to be unlimited.
*  And and where what what happens, it's like, well, that's TV and on on social.
*  And it's going to be how can I destroy and break this this individual?
*  And that's where it is. And it gets incredibly personal.
*  And it has it has an impact.
*  I mean, that certainly it has for me.
*  And until we have unlimited money, it's going to get more and more mean, personal and expensive.
*  And if you look at the billion, billions of dollars that spend, how what we could have done for our society, the kinds of rules that we could build and other things if we didn't spend all those money to tear each other apart.
*  Yes, it's very strange.
*  And it sets a terrible tone for the rest of the country because these races, even though when they're over, people go back to a certain level of civility.
*  It's already been established that this is on the table.
*  These personal attacks is evil, vicious propaganda, taking things out of context, conflating people's words.
*  Yeah, no, you you you have you know, you take any a quote, take it out of context, click that shit, put 10 million dollars behind that.
*  And that's in front of, you know, millions of eyeballs right there spontaneously on that.
*  And it just it's directly right at you.
*  And there's it's it's unlimited money.
*  I mean, you know, when you look back on this race, it's like you are going to be stunned just how much money is put in that, how crazy those ads are.
*  And just you can't get away from it.
*  Like Montana, Montana has, I think, six or seven hundred thousand vote voters, and they've dropped a quarter of a billion dollars.
*  I don't know how you could even spend a quarter of a billion dollars in Montana.
*  It's like if you have a hundred thousand dollars in cash, you have to pay that in going to a McDonald's.
*  I don't know how they do that.
*  But I promise you, everybody in Pennsylvania or in any of the these kinds of contested states, they just can't get away from that shit.
*  And at this point, they just stop paying attention to it.
*  It's it just it's like it's it's noise.
*  It's toxic kinds of noise.
*  And it does. It sets a tone for the whole country that we're willing to engage in this way.
*  Oh, yeah. No, it's like that's the thing.
*  It turns everything into a night fights or worse.
*  And it is about trying to destroy that person and to convince other people that you are the worst thing in the world.
*  You're you're a Marxist, you're a communist or you're just all kinds of things.
*  And it's the lowest, lowest denominator.
*  And if you really want to fix American politics, I mean, there's there are issues.
*  But I promise you, if you removed that, that would be a dramatic kinds of thing.
*  And we all have to play that game.
*  Some of us like myself, I got a lot more of my money from small dollar donations like like Bernie, Bernie.
*  I know he's been on the show, Bernie.
*  But then other ones, it's like everyone chases the bigger the bigger checks.
*  It's undeniable there, too.
*  And it's so disingenuous.
*  And there's PACs and there's other kinds of organizations one way or another.
*  It's just it's just the way to funnel tens of million dollars to just tear someone apart.
*  What was your background before you got into politics?
*  I was a social I was a social worker and I came to a very, very deeply broken and fractioned factor community.
*  And I actually started helping young men and women get their GEDs and just kind of getting their lives back on track in that sense.
*  And then that's why I did that for several several years.
*  And then I decided I wanted to run for mayor and mayor of a small of a small town.
*  And we had problems with inequality in a community that 90 percent of the population abandoned the community.
*  And left. And if anyone's aware of the U.S. steel, I mean, I live right now across the street from that iconic steel mill.
*  I mean, that's really that that used to be America's Silicon Valley, like about half of the world's steel used to be manufactured there.
*  But now so much has changed.
*  And then I ran for mayor and a small town mayor.
*  And and then that turned into, well, I decided like the kinds of issues that were meaningful to me and the personal kinds of experiences.
*  I just thought, hey, I want to project my kinds of experiences and my values.
*  And I started to I ran for I ran for the first time in 2016.
*  I ran for the Senate. I mean, it's pretty kind of strange that you have a small town mayor running for the United States Senate.
*  And but I mean, we had no money.
*  I mean, zero, zero money on that.
*  But we just we'd had a really like grassroots kind of a thing.
*  And we got out across Pennsylvania and we came up a little short.
*  But we pulled in 20 percent of the of the votes, which that was pretty pretty people thought that was pretty remarkable.
*  And I carried my home county, which is Allegheny.
*  That's the second largest. And that really kind of set the stage to run for lieutenant governor a couple of years later after 2016.
*  But 2016, though, that was where America met Donald Trump.
*  And I was I was early, you know, turning the alarm off, saying, hey, we have to be concerned here.
*  Like, you know, Trump has connected with people in ways that it's like we have to be concerned.
*  And I'll never forget it was June in 2016.
*  And I was I was a I was a surrogate for for Clinton.
*  And and Trump announced, hey, I'm showing up in a town called Menessen, Menessen, which is a small steel town in the valley down from from Mars.
*  And I'm like, why the why is he showing up in?
*  I mean, that's not like so either he's crazy or they've they've plugged into something.
*  And like, I have to see that. So I try to get into that just to kind of see what was going on.
*  But they they recognized me and they said, yeah, get the fuck out.
*  You're hard to hide. Yeah.
*  And so they figured out that they have to connect and to make that kind of an argument to go to these kind of places.
*  And it did. It resonated.
*  And you started to see a lot of the signs and a lot of the energy.
*  And it's like, hey, you know, there's there's a there's a problem.
*  And the Clinton campaign, everybody assumed that she was going to run away with it.
*  Yeah. And and they made they made the mistake of just showing up in Philadelphia, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, and assume that they were going to be OK.
*  But but a lot had slipped.
*  And now the margins Trump created margins that were unheard.
*  Like, you know, we referred to them as Romney margins.
*  So in other words, you have red counties and Romney would they would cover those by about 60 to 65 percent.
*  And Trump did. He created 80s, 80s.
*  We were losing 80, 20, 80, 20.
*  And like, well, yeah, that's a small county.
*  But, yeah, you multiply that by 57, 57 other counties.
*  And that's how they scale up.
*  And that's how he won. And he won by forty five thousand votes.
*  And that's why he captured the blue wall.
*  And that made him president. And here we are right now.
*  The blue wall is they're both fighting on the blue wall.
*  And the blue wall is Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.
*  Hmm. When when you were running during 2016, what were you trying to accomplish?
*  Like, what did you want to do that you felt like you could uniquely provide a service for?
*  Well, it wasn't I just think it was just different.
*  I'm like, hey, I was running. I was running for about forgotten places.
*  People were America's turn their backs on them and talking about those those kinds of important issues like living wage,
*  abandoning the industrial parts of America.
*  And some people watching what what things have been left behind in places like Braddock.
*  It's like it's astonishing.
*  Ninety percent of people left and 90 percent of the buildings are gone.
*  And that whole region has just been just thrown thrown away.
*  So I just wanted I didn't know there was a path.
*  I mean, there were two other people in the primary and I thought I could maybe split.
*  I could split the other two and just sneak by and get 33 percent plus one extra vote.
*  But I came up a little short because I had no money because it's always going to be about money.
*  And then Katie McGinty, she won, but she lost.
*  And then that that was that same cycle.
*  And then in that the same year that Trump won.
*  And so since you've been in, since you've gotten into the Senate,
*  what meaningful change have you been able to accomplish there?
*  Well, again, you're a freshman and my colleague and one that was was just here, Senator Vance.
*  I mean, we were both in the same cycle.
*  We both ran in twenty two. So we both there for less than two years.
*  And it's really based on seniority.
*  And it's just kind of like, hey, get on the end of that line.
*  So you are a freshman and it's your influence is at least in the institution are limited in some sense.
*  But if you have a bigger platform and I did and I try to have those kinds of impacts and having those conversations.
*  But my first couple, first half of that first year, that was a little took a different detour because I was dealing with with depression.
*  I was at the depression and I realized that I was in a in a bad place.
*  So so having that having to make those kind of choices.
*  And I signed myself into Walter Reed to get help because the depression and and so I think it's an important conversation.
*  And I knew I thought at that time it could be politically could be difficult.
*  But I thought it was important. And now if that cost me something politically, I'm OK.
*  So that's why I'm continuing.
*  So how the impact I've had, I never fully expected that that voice would would break through.
*  And I'm I'm in contact with people constantly saying thank you for talking about this.
*  I chose to get help or I chose not to follow that path on self harm.
*  And so I've had active conversations with member of Congress or fathers with with younger kids.
*  And they're like, hey, can you please talk?
*  And I and I do that. I'm happy to talk to anybody.
*  And so that's a way I've had an impact through it through all of that.
*  And also my voice through after what happened on 10th, 7th, October 7.
*  And I've decided I was going to be a very consistent voice for Israel through that.
*  So that's why kind of like the platform.
*  But in terms of if anyone's being honest, whether it was a senator, Vance or any kinds of freshman senators,
*  it's very limited because otherwise there's people that have been there for 25, 30 years.
*  There are the ones that are the chairman.
*  And if you're a minority party, you have incredibly limited kinds of ability to to to move an agenda.
*  So the depression thing, I think it's very important that you talked about that.
*  I think transparency is something that people really appreciate.
*  So many people suffer from depression.
*  It's such a normal part of being a human being.
*  And for a guy like you, who's a senator, who's already gone through being attacked,
*  already gone through all these horrible things that they said about you, are you recovering from a stroke?
*  It takes a lot of courage to come out and discuss that.
*  I think it's really important. I'm really glad you did it.
*  Well, I don't. Well, thank you. But I don't think you're so like courage.
*  It's like I only had a choice. But it is courage because you know you're going to be publicly attacked.
*  And it's a vulnerable point. But I think it's not because I think so many people suffer from it.
*  I think there's courage in coming out and talking about it openly and realizing that people are going to use as an attack vector and saying, you know what?
*  This is important to talk about. This is important to acknowledge and to to show people that you can recover from something like that.
*  Well, originally, I was just going to talk about depression.
*  And there's a paradox. You know, you might be a place in your life that you've actually kind of won.
*  But depression lies to you and it convinces you that you've lost.
*  And my depression got far more worse after I won. And then it was a it was a downward spiral.
*  And then if you don't if you don't check your depression, then you go down a dangerous slope about self harm.
*  And I started to have I got to to occupy that kind of a dark place.
*  And and that's when I realized that I have a choice. It's like if I don't address this, then I had I had an emergency break.
*  You know, I it's like I have to stop. I have to stop. I have to. And that was my kids.
*  I'm like I I'm like I cannot be I can't be the example.
*  And when you're going to get older in life and you're going to have those kinds of challenge, well, hey, dad decided to to leave.
*  Oh, that must be the right thing. And I'm like, I will I cannot allow myself to be the example for that.
*  So I stayed in the game and I was able to get help. And I got much better.
*  So like for me, it's like I originally didn't want to talk about self harm because that's definitely that's definitely not a great political winner.
*  Right. But I was like, I have to be answered.
*  Excuse me. I have to be honored about that and an honest and and people that really resonated with people.
*  I was I think the first person I was the first politician, especially at that level, talking about self harm.
*  And, you know, if people are that are suffering, people that I mean, you have a huge, huge audience, I'm willing to bet plenty of them are suffering from that or looking through those kinds.
*  No doubt. No doubt. Yeah.
*  And I, you know, I promise people whatever your path, whatever your path is for recovery, and I'm not an expert.
*  But if you promise yourself to stay in that game, stay in that game that you already, you know, you're almost guaranteed to get better because I promise you it will get better.
*  And I was at the point where I was really, you know, in a very dark place.
*  And I stayed in that game and I am staying in front of front of you right now and having this conversation.
*  And so that's what I try to tell everybody, whether they're listening today or in other times.
*  And I've had that it's it's an honest conversation, but it is a red and blue conversation and it's a rural and urban or suburban conversation.
*  It's men or women or even younger kids.
*  I've had conversations with teenagers, you know, with their parents, and they've even tried to take their lives.
*  And I can't think of anything much more tragic than especially a young person taking their lives over some of the things that that and and I never thought that that voice would would penetrate.
*  But it did. And that's why I'm willing to have that conversation.
*  Well, it's apparently it's very common for people that undergo major surgery to have depression afterwards.
*  And there's a bunch of physiological reasons for that, they believe.
*  My friend Dr. Mark Gordon, who's done a lot of work on traumatic brain injuries and depression amongst athletes and soldiers.
*  He did a lot of research on that. And one of one of the things that they found is that people that undergo like a long period of anesthesia and either heart surgery or any kind of major surgery,
*  there's a disruption of your endocrine system afterwards that leads people to be just weary and broken down.
*  And I could imagine that along with the Senate race and all the other chaos and all the stresses involved with that, it plays a significant factor.
*  Well, I'm sure it must have been a factor.
*  I discovered that I had two friends that roughly my age and they had young kids and they took their lives and they were both in the media and both.
*  One was worked for an incredibly elite organization and another one had a really strong position.
*  One had a heart attack and the other one had a stroke years earlier.
*  And I found out and I wish I could have talked to them and I did talk to them.
*  But it doesn't mean they were weak or that they gave up.
*  It's just I got lucky and I found my emergency break.
*  And if you have any kinds of study on people and self-harm, there was an individual, he jumped off the Golden Gate and he survived.
*  And immediately after he says as he crossed over the rail and he I want to live, I want to live.
*  What have I done? It's like I've made a terrible mistake.
*  And you hit you hit the water going 75 miles an hour.
*  And it's it's very against chance of surviving.
*  But he did. And now he became obsessed with this idea.
*  And he he looked out for everyone that survived and about 45 people out of 1800 people that have jumped over.
*  They survived and it was unanimously people immediately like, oh, my God, I want to live, I want to live, I want to live.
*  And not one single person thought, well, I wish I was more successful.
*  So like that's I try to put that forward.
*  And I can't imagine how difficult because they had children the same age mine and trying to explain to a 10 year old son like, why did daddy leave?
*  And those are dark conversations.
*  And so it's not about weakness.
*  It's about trying to get away from that.
*  People that are suffering from depression, it takes if anyone's been there, it's like your mind is on fire and you just want to get away from that.
*  Just please, I need relief from that kind of a thing.
*  And every now and then you have like kind of like the eye of the hurricane or you finally thought maybe things could get better.
*  But it it it roars back in and it's like you get to back to that very dark place.
*  And and I just you know, I just tell everybody I'm beg I'm begging you stay in that game.
*  I promise you it can get better.
*  And the depression is lying to you.
*  It is absolutely lying to you.
*  And is but don't make the kind of choice that you can't come back from.
*  I have a friend who jumped off the bridge, died that way.
*  Yeah, it's a it's a terrible, just a terrible thing to find out.
*  And you always feel like you could have talked to them.
*  You could have helped.
*  You always feel like I didn't know.
*  I didn't know he was suffering.
*  And then I found out that he died a few days later and it was just like it just leaves you feeling so lost.
*  It's such a terrible way to go to that bridge.
*  God, how many people like would you say?
*  How many people have jumped off that bridge?
*  The Golden Gate?
*  I think that they reference are about over 1800 people and a small, small, tiny survived.
*  And really being faced that idea that you're not going to come back.
*  It's like spontaneously curative, like, oh, my God, I want to live.
*  I want to live. I want to live like it's it's it was unanimous about.
*  And that's such an important kinds of research that that that he did.
*  And it's like and again, like that's my message.
*  It has to be very simple. Stay in that game.
*  It's like you you can't do this. You can't do this.
*  And you need support. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You need support, whatever that is.
*  And some people have different kinds of resources.
*  I mean, I would want that for everybody.
*  The resources that I had. That's not fair.
*  It's not fair. And I got lucky.
*  It's not because I'm like I'm so much stronger or better.
*  It's like, no, no, I just got lucky on that.
*  And I promise you, you're not going to regret staying in the game and you can get better.
*  And that is probably I think in my my opinion, that's about 75 percent of getting back better.
*  What have you done to help? What has helped you?
*  My my family.
*  That's that's really what like every every person needs to have like that emerge.
*  I call that like an emergency break.
*  It's like, you know, you are you're out of control.
*  You know, you're having that the darkest conversation you'll have with yourself.
*  And you have to have some something to stop that.
*  Otherwise, it's you're going to go over the edge.
*  And and everyone needs to have that whatever that is, whether it's your family,
*  whether it's your wife or your husband or whether it is or this that there has to be some it has to get better.
*  It's going to get better. You know, that's why I say stay on the game.
*  And I'm not an expert. I'm not trained in that.
*  But when people reach out to me and say, well, I feel like this and and I'm like, hey, it's like, you know, help works.
*  I promise you it will get better.
*  And I can't guarantee what your path will be.
*  But what I can say is that stay in that game and you are going to find your way on that path and you're never going to regret it's like, oh, you know, it's it's just the finality, the finality of that.
*  And you're something you can make a bad choice and, you know, well, that might set you back in life.
*  But but that's that that's the one the one choice you can't come back from.
*  And you will leave people in your life that they'll never understand or you wish you could reach back and you could let them know and stay away from that kind of blackness because you're I promise you, you would regret.
*  And if you can't come back.
*  So what has helped you counseling medication like what what did what are the things that got you back on track other than just your family?
*  I. The election and everything, I was convinced that I've lost everything.
*  I had it was difficult to fully speak and my my kids, they got pulled into the social media kinds of invective.
*  And it's like I've I've destroyed my health.
*  I've I've and now I've against odds I won.
*  And now am I going to be able to do this job?
*  And and, you know, would I have been better off if if I didn't survive?
*  And I got to that kind of a dark place.
*  But and then I just had this like that spontaneous where it's like my kids, it's like, no, I love you.
*  I love you. Like, oh, my gosh. It's like, like when they were visiting, I didn't want them to visit me at Walter Reed.
*  I was like, why would they want to be around this? Right.
*  But they did. And it was like this kind of spontaneous kinds of love.
*  And and it just was like a shot. And it's just like, I can come back. I can come back.
*  I thought it's like, well, why would they want this mess back?
*  And and and then, you know, just working through a lot of those things and other kinds of techniques and things.
*  It was like, but that was probably the single most transformative event where it's like I realized that I can come back to my life.
*  Otherwise, it's like I thought I've lost everything. Would I be able to even do my job?
*  And it's like, do I even have a career? I mean, I'm talking about like that was a significant national story.
*  When after I signed myself in and that pulled my kids in through that.
*  I mean, this idea and after we announced that we're signing in and there were news trucks outside their house and and they had they had the trauma of thinking that that could have lost after the stroke.
*  And now he is it's just it's they it's put them through so much.
*  And that's why I was convinced that they probably don't want me around.
*  And then I made the I made the stupid mistake of I went on social media and things.
*  I'm like, and just I read some of that shit.
*  I mean, it's just it's just oh my God, millions and millions of views and videos.
*  And it's just like, you know, going after my family and saying, you know, you know, hey, he's a vegetable.
*  He's you know, he's a retard and, you know, sling sling blade and all kinds of things.
*  And it wasn't it wasn't the individual kinds of insults.
*  It was the volume and just how widespread it was.
*  And I'm like, who jumps online to go after a stranger that's never really done anything to you personally?
*  Well, I think it's not just individuals. I think it's targeted.
*  I think there's a lot of that stuff, especially when there's something that is significant as a Senate seat.
*  And I think there's well, I mean, it's like if I have a hundred if I have a hundred million dollars to convince you that you're a terrible person and you're the worst thing ever.
*  And that that that inspires a lot of people and they hey, that's the mission.
*  It's like he clearly he must be those things.
*  And, you know, we're now there is no there's no tap out.
*  There is no tap out.
*  It's like even after we won after I won, in some sense, it actually accelerated.
*  Right. It's not that the war is not over.
*  It's just begun. No. Oh, no, no.
*  And the second the second you step into that kind of arena on the federal level for like a Senate seat, if it's like a purple state like Pennsylvania, you know, I promise you there will be tens and tens of millions of dollars.
*  And their mission is to turn you into the worst thing in the world.
*  And whoever survives, that's the one that's going to be in that seat.
*  And I still will never understand why someone, you know, independently wealthy kinds of people will spend, you know, incredible amounts of money.
*  And I tried people like there's no glamour here.
*  Like I like I'm in a five hundred square foot apartment and I'm like here with my phone.
*  I'm like, hey, Grubhub, what's it tonight?
*  And then it's like I'm like I watch TV on Netflix and things.
*  And I I ask I ask my colleagues, I'm like, hey, is there kind of secret society like, you know, like, you know, crazy parties or sitting around with cigars and, you know, you know, this and I like, well, no, I kind of have the same version of that.
*  That's the perception, though, right?
*  The perception is you get the perception is invited into a club.
*  Yeah. Now you control the world.
*  Yeah, that we all have many kinds of dialogue on West Wing, you know, like talking like, you know, kinds of turn, you know, and really it's just like and I describe that as a lot of it's just bad.
*  It's just bad performance art.
*  You know, yeah, thanks.
*  That's usually what it is.
*  It's just bad performance art.
*  And some people like if you're if you're in a safe in a safe state or a safe seat, you and especially if you have the resources and they're incredibly wealthy people, they buy a house and they move their life there.
*  So you're able to kind of things.
*  But like I don't have those resources and I'm in a very, very probably ultimate purple.
*  And so I spend more than 50 percent of my time away and I miss my kids.
*  It's it's it's rough for for that.
*  I mean, I signed up for that.
*  But I promise you there's no glamour in that.
*  Well, there's certainly no glamour, if you're honest.
*  But I think there's a lot of people that look to certain members of the government that have jobs that pay one hundred and fifty hundred seventy thousand dollars a year, but somehow or another acquire hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of their career, usually through some kind of insider trading.
*  Well, yeah, of course. I mean, I don't own any of those stocks or anything indefinitely.
*  Like if if you have any kinds of impact or you know that there's something is coming.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's like you.
*  How is that legal?
*  It's well, no, we should have the kind of legislation to make sure that you're not like if you are on Congress, you shouldn't have any kinds of stocks because you are going to be passing kinds of laws, et cetera, et cetera, that you know, you have to separate that.
*  They really shouldn't be a part of that kinds of a thing.
*  And I mean, I'm all out.
*  I'm open.
*  All of us, we have to have our wealth and our all that there.
*  And if I'm not the poorest, I have probably the bottom five and other people there are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
*  So, you know, we can't have that situation where, you know, if you're going to be involved on those kinds of legislation that you can't be enriched by those kinds of and there has to be some kind of influence.
*  That seems simple. That seems like logical, like most people would agree to that.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of inertia. It's the same thing.
*  I think if any one of us were being honest, money is destroying our democracy.
*  And that's that some people that might sound trite, though, it's a cliche, but it's 100 percent, though.
*  I think most people who are objective would agree with you.
*  I promise you it is it is absolute.
*  It is a scourge of American democracy and money is king.
*  And what's that money for?
*  That money is for tearing you apart.
*  And that creates more and more and more kinds of incivility and cruelty.
*  And then now, when I went through when I was in graduate school for that stuff, I mean, there was no social media and there wasn't, you know, there wasn't podcasts.
*  There wasn't all kinds of things.
*  So that made it more difficult.
*  But but now there's all of those things.
*  And social media is an accelerant and count, you know, just unlimited money.
*  And that has what you know, like I'm sure you know, you're you're an athlete and if you've heard that NFL players is like, wait, would you want your son to play?
*  And sometimes say, well, no, I wouldn't want that for my son.
*  And and it's like, I'm relieved that my oldest is like he has no interest in being in politics.
*  So it's I can't imagine it's going to get better until, you know, we address this idea that unlimited money is unlimited attack and it's unlimited cruelty and hyperbole and just all kinds of poisoning the will that, you know, half of us are going to hate your guts.
*  And the other half, that's my team.
*  Yeah.
*  So, well, I strongly feel that the Internet should remain the way it is in terms of people being able to post on social media anonymously if they so choose.
*  But the problem with that is it can be captured by money and it can be captured by these enormous groups that have bought farms, whether it's state actors, whether it's other countries, other nations that are doing that to try to attack the people.
*  Whether it's our own country itself doing it because I think we do it too.
*  And I think that packs do it.
*  And it's just people hook themselves up.
*  It's like you, you self-select your cocoon.
*  Yes.
*  You know, and like I'm a big fan of Apple News and it's like 13 bucks a month.
*  And but I read everything across the spectrum, you know, very, very left and very, very right in between.
*  And I think that's the biggest problem.
*  And it's like 13 bucks a month.
*  And but I read everything across the spectrum, you know, very, very left and very, very right in between.
*  And I think it's really I think that's your responsibility, especially if you're an elected leader to be challenged, to challenge yourself on the ideas.
*  And it's like clearly one side doesn't have all the answers and the other side can't be 100 percent wrong.
*  And and it's just like being challenging and living or taking in other kinds of perspectives.
*  I think that's a responsibility because otherwise if you only just cocoon yourself into and it's just it turns into one gigantic circle jerk.
*  And and that's why it just turns people to just kind of dig in.
*  And it's like, hey, you know, the problem is them and we.
*  Yes.
*  Well, it's a problem with human beings in general.
*  So we tend to be very tribal and we tend to commit to an ideology.
*  It's comfortable. Yes, comfortable.
*  Sure. Especially when you're in an echo chamber.
*  Everyone's agreeing with you.
*  You get social credit from saying the things that these people agree with and you feed off that.
*  But it's when it's being captured by it's not just these people exchanging ideas.
*  It's also a bunch of people that are manipulating people's ideas.
*  You know, I don't know if you've ever paid attention to like Renee de Restes work with the Internet Research Agency,
*  what they what they uncovered, what they were doing was using this was like during the 2016 election using social media.
*  And it was a lot of Russian troll farms and troll farms in other countries.
*  It's possible. But but but but to be honest, I that election wasn't turned on, I think, Russian interference.
*  No, I'm not. I what what happened in 2016 was Trump, you know, he plugged into like kinds of of an energy or, you know,
*  like it was just like kind of looking to make that kind of a connection there.
*  Well, he's a legitimate outsider. This is the appeal.
*  The appeal is that people think that this system is completely rigged and it's captured by money and special interests and enormous corporations.
*  And that here's a guy who is outside of this system completely.
*  And the evidence of that is how the system turned against him and how you got to see people on television every night talking about Russiagate,
*  talking about how he's a puppet of Putin, talking about the Steele dossier, talking about all these different things that turned out to not be true.
*  And it it further cemented.
*  I never bought into some of that kind of stuff, because if anyone that spent any time on the ground in one of those states,
*  it's like it's very clear that wasn't because of some some small kinds of tweets and things like whatever.
*  It's it's it's it's undeniable.
*  And also, remember, like he was, you know, the Republican Party was like, hey, this is a joke.
*  And I remember Jeb Jeb Bush, you know, and he he had like 100 or 200 million dollars.
*  And and he just went by. He ticked him off.
*  And and even then, people thought he was going to win.
*  But he did. But but remember, though, overall, though, that was seventy five thousand votes.
*  That's a mathematical like, you know, I mean, think of that one hundred one hundred sixty million votes.
*  Seventy five thousand spread across three large states, including my own.
*  That transform American politics and in the world as well.
*  And it just came down to seventy five thousand voters in those three states.
*  And that's that's kind of where that's where we're at.
*  Yeah, it's it's an extraordinary time in that regard, right?
*  I mean, oh, yeah. Well, I mean, if I charted territory.
*  Well, I reference a movie if you like a Bulworth.
*  I remember the movie. And it was Warren Beatty and he was a senator and he kind of have like a breakdown.
*  And he started saying provocative things.
*  He used to get up in front of his audience and and kind of like like the gaff of accidentally speak, you know, telling the truth.
*  Yeah. And it was kind of like it was an absurd.
*  I mean, when I was in grad school, that was like put up as like, well, I mean, people enjoyed that.
*  And now that became a term in politics saying, oh, we affect even President Obama's like, hey, we all want to secretly go full Bulworth, full Bulworth.
*  And but but that's what really he channeled in where he would say, you know, it's kind of like he projects kind of like, well, I don't give a fuck and just say all those kinds of a thing.
*  And people have responded to those kinds of things.
*  And, you know, a lot of people, that's the that's the bug.
*  But you have to understand that for enough people, that's the feature.
*  Yeah. And and that's kind of what they want.
*  And whatever that is, it describes a brand that, you know, it's it's not I don't admire that.
*  But you still have to kind of marvel at the level to say crazy kinds of things that that you well, I guess maybe we're both old enough to remember when George in the George Bush Al Gore, he is like, oh, God, this guy.
*  And that moved the polls. People are like, he rolled his eyes at Bush, you know, like things and like, you know, like it used to be much more stayed.
*  And now think of what's been said now. Right. All of the stuff.
*  And and I don't think people aren't paying attention. Some of the whatever the latest outrage is.
*  Yeah, it's I think one of your appeals is that you speak like a normal human being.
*  You speak like a person who actually cares about these issues and you seemingly speak from the heart.
*  You don't seem polished, which is a good thing.
*  And I think I wish I wish I was more handsome.
*  I don't think that's good. No, no, no, I know.
*  It's like I'm honest. Yeah, I'm honest.
*  I think I'm in I'm in touch with, you know, what I'm limited.
*  I wasn't blessed with model looks and but it's not looks.
*  It's the polish of speaking like a congressman, like a senator, like a presidential candidate.
*  But it's this kind of bullshit way of communicating that's inauthentic that even though it's effective, even though it's polished and smooth,
*  people never get a sense of who that person is as a human being.
*  Trump is not polished. He's not polished in that sense.
*  But you get a sense of who he is as a human being.
*  There doesn't seem to be a veil.
*  There doesn't seem to be this this disconnect between a human being and the thoughts.
*  You might not agree with him.
*  You might think he's crass or rude, but at least you know that he's the guy that's talking.
*  These are his thoughts.
*  And you people trust that way more than they try to someone who's, you know, polished but full of shit.
*  Yeah, no, it's it's that scarface.
*  It's like, you know, word and balls.
*  Yeah, I'm not, you know, and that's you're losing politically if you're telling people to not believe what their eyes are seeing.
*  Right.
*  You know, like these kinds of issues.
*  And it's like, I'm not going to lie or I'm not going to toe a line if I don't believe if I don't believe in that.
*  That so but in terms of of the conversation, I think it's like it's all I've got.
*  And and it's not because I don't care.
*  It's actually I'm very committed and I really do care.
*  But but I think people are like I think authenticity.
*  That's the that's the last that's really that's one of the last meaningful currency in this shitty business.
*  So I was having a conversation this morning with a friend of mine and we were talking about voter ID.
*  And he was shocked that you don't need voter ID in I believe it's 15 states, 15 states require no ID.
*  Twenty I think it's 24 or 25 states require ID, but only I think 11 of them require you to have photo ID.
*  This is a weird one in this election that I've tried to look at as objectively as possible.
*  And I can't see any reason why you would not need ID to vote unless you wanted people to vote that aren't qualified to vote.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, like honestly, honestly, I would I would like to remind everybody and it's not like a talking point.
*  It's actually it's in a fact that voter fraud is incredibly, incredibly rare.
*  It's really hard to to to to get away with that successfully.
*  And in 2020 at scale, you mean? Yeah, it's not scalable.
*  Yeah, it's like I mean, it's like and usually it's kind of local kinds of communities and people that either know that person or it's it's not it's never going to be organized in a point where you can pack.
*  You can pack a box or you can't determine that that kind of a thing.
*  It's it's just that, you know, after election, election, election, it's just never been, you know, in 2020 out of over millions of votes in 2020 in Pennsylvania, there were five or six ones.
*  And what happened is that that they turned out to be the Republicans and they used their deceased, their dead moms, you know, to vote for Trump through that.
*  And that that was that was documented and they were all they were all they were caught.
*  They were charged. They were convicted.
*  And all those votes, that would have been six votes out of all of it.
*  So do you think that that's the only voter fraud that exists?
*  Well, people also we need to remind that, you know, the voter database, their cross checks against deaths and who's moved or what's their status are like, like, you know, all that's cross checked back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
*  So it's it's it's a living kinds of thing where it's continually updated and all of those kinds of things and itself checks.
*  And remember also in 2020, you know, Trump, there was like, oh, there's there's cheating.
*  There's all these things are happening. And remember, there's probably fifty seven, fifty eight red counties and all of those commissioners that are in charge of that.
*  They were like, hey, no, there was none. There was none.
*  And even in Georgia, even in Georgia, Governor Kemp, Governor Kemp, the K, you know, Georgia, you know, it was very close, but it was it was honest.
*  There was no there was no kinds of fraud in that.
*  And that's right. That's a Republican.
*  But other than making things a little bit easier to cheat, what would be the logic behind not having voter ID?
*  Like what I've tried to look at this as objectively as possible.
*  I can't find any reason why you would not require someone to be able to prove that they're the person they say they are when they're putting in their ballots.
*  It's not a hill that I'm saying we have to die on that, too.
*  Again, but it's a vulnerability, clearly.
*  Right. Well, well, it's also there.
*  Some people may not believe that in a lot of these kinds of communities, you know, ones that I that I live in, for some people, they they're not going to they don't they don't have an ID necessarily, or they've lost it or whatever.
*  And, you know, let's need one to get a driver's license.
*  You need one to get a car.
*  They don't have any one.
*  Yeah, they would have to get an ID or it costs X amount of dollars or those kinds of a thing.
*  It's a barrier and it usually tends to skew more towards people that are coming from those kinds of communities.
*  And the Republicans understand that they're usually going to they're going to skew towards Democratic voters through that.
*  And so that's kind of the argument on that.
*  And there's never been any evidence that there is widespread kinds of of voter fraud.
*  And that's but we really didn't have widespread mail in ballots to the extent that it was done in 2020.
*  We really didn't have all of those were all of those were those five or six, you know, dead moms that were voting.
*  Those were all those were all.
*  Well, actually, one one guy, one guy went in, he voted, you know, and then he went up to his car and he put on sunglasses and a bobcap and he walked in.
*  He's like, Hi, hello, I'm here to vote.
*  And the guy's like, You were just here.
*  What are you doing?
*  And then they called the police.
*  And then it's like he was trying to double vote.
*  Did you see the story about the Chinese national who was arrested because he voted and then he tried to get his ballot back.
*  And that's how they they caught him.
*  It's possible. Yeah, this is the thing that just happened.
*  And unfortunately, once he's voted, even though he was not eligible to vote, his vote is going to count.
*  Texas removed some I mean, there's lawsuits about it, but Texas removed somewhere in the neighborhood of a million people that were ineligible to vote that could have been voting.
*  Well, everybody knows who's voting and who's not voting on that.
*  And then that's why.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  What do you mean by everybody knows?
*  Well, and remember also to Dominion, you know, people on the Trump side, they all said that that Dominions was corrupt.
*  And then they and that cost Fox eight hundred million dollars.
*  They had to pay eight hundred million dollars about defamation for saying that there was it was rigged or if it's not and there was no evidence and they had to just acknowledge that that this was the honest thing.
*  So but Dominion is it's a computer program, right?
*  It's a it's a computer.
*  Like that's what you do.
*  You're doing electronic voting.
*  Yeah, that was that was a system that mostly and often it was red states that were using those.
*  Do you remember? Well, that is true, because do you remember the documentary Hacking Democracy?
*  Did you ever see that again?
*  There's always going to be people that are going to try to have an influence on.
*  Right. But did you see that documentary?
*  It was about the Republicans doing it.
*  I haven't seen that documentary documentary during the Bush administration and one that they showed that the Diebold machines when Diebold was a significant contributor, I believe, to the Republican Party.
*  They showed in the documentary that you could use a third party input to change the results.
*  And they actually proved it in the documentary.
*  And people are pointing to this is, oh, my God, the Republicans are cheating.
*  And the Republicans have used this to try to rig the election for George Bush.
*  It was an HBO documentary.
*  I'm not accusing. I've never accused the Republicans like well, in 2016.
*  I know I'm not saying you did.
*  What I'm trying to say is that this is not a thing that's only been leveled against the Democrats using it.
*  This is not like an accusation that only applies to Democrats in the past.
*  A similar accusation was applied to Republicans.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, I think we can all agree that we need to have a secure just like our border.
*  We need a secure border and we need an absolutely secure voting voting system as well, too.
*  I mean, that should never be considered controversial.
*  Right. And in 2016, a lot of Democrats were outraged that we lost.
*  But I never claimed that there was the Republicans cheated or do all those kinds of things.
*  And it's like, you know, the problem, the problem for accusing that there was voter fraud is that if you don't like the outcome.
*  Right. You know, so.
*  And I have never witnessed a rep a an election if they've won that they claimed.
*  Well, there might be, you know, we might have cheated.
*  Yeah, we're not cheating. So that right. So I think that's that's kind of that's that's I think that's kind of the underlying truth about that.
*  And of course, you know, I think I was the first Democrat saying, hey, we need a secure border.
*  It's a significant issue. And if I thought there was any kinds of issues and I've been very vigilant throughout, I've been actively involved in those kinds of things.
*  And I've never witnessed those kinds of a thing.
*  What do you mean by issues like what kind of issues you're talking about?
*  You talk about people letting people in in order to get votes.
*  Well, it's not there's not that level kinds. I don't think there's that level kinds of organization.
*  But there is an organization that's moving these people to swing states.
*  There's a significant number of these people that are illegal immigrants that have made their way to swing states.
*  And then there's been calls for amnesty.
*  There's been calls for allowing these people to have a pathway to citizenship and allow them to vote.
*  The fear that a lot of people have is that this is a coordinated effort to take these people that you're allowing to come into the country.
*  Then you're providing them with all sorts of services like food stamps and housing and setting them up and then providing a pathway to amnesty.
*  And then you would have voters that would be significantly voting towards the Democrats because they're the people that enabled them to come into the country in the first place, first place and provided them with those services.
*  This is a big fear that people have and that you're rigging this system and that this will turn all these states into essentially locked blue like California is.
*  Well, you know, it's immigration is always going to be a tough issue in our nation.
*  I had as a professor in grad school, Alan Simpson, Alan Simpson, and he was he was a United States senator.
*  He was Wyoming and he was he was he was actually a pro-choice Republican.
*  I mean, how rare that would be. Well, it doesn't exist now.
*  And he said, you are never going to have any meaningful immigration kinds of legislation.
*  He's like, because both side, that's useful for them and it's going to be back and forth, back and forth.
*  And he said that 25 years ago, useful, meaning the debate, having it always some political talking point, one side or the other.
*  It's useful. And he he he said they were never going to be.
*  And he said that in 1999 and I was I voted for it for the border deal.
*  And that and that went down. And and that's I mean, he said that 25 years ago.
*  And that was absolutely true now that that that they had an opportunity to do a comprehensive border bipartisan.
*  And that went down because Trump, he declared that that that's that's a bad deal after it was negotiated with with the other side.
*  But what didn't that deal also involve amnesty?
*  And didn't that deal also involve a significant number of illegal aliens being allowed into the country every year?
*  I think it was two million people.
*  So it was still the same sort of situation.
*  And their fear is exactly what I talked about, that these people will be moved to swing states and that that will be used to essentially rig those states and turn them blue forever.
*  Well, I'm not I'm not really sure if that's that's what's what's in play.
*  I think it's really like it's important that we have to have an honest conversation.
*  But doesn't that seem logical, though, if you have a significant number of people that are being moved into swing states that have come across the border illegally and then you've provided them with all these services, you provided them with food stamps, EBT provided them with housing.
*  You could if you gave those people amnesty and allow those people to vote.
*  And it was very organized.
*  You're talking about seventy five thousand votes over a few counties that switched everything over to the Republicans.
*  You could see how you import 10 million people over the course of four years illegally and then move a significant number of them to swing states and then provide them with all these services and then give them a path to citizenship.
*  You could essentially rig those states.
*  Undeniably, immigration is changing our nation.
*  I mean, I haven't spent a lot of time in Texas, but it's very clear that that immigration has has remade Texas.
*  And I think it's generally it's for a good thing.
*  And like my wife, my wife's Brazilian and she was she was her family was documented and she was seven years old when she was brought here.
*  And I and I'm the big pro pro immigration guy that there was.
*  But it's also has to be true that we need a secure border.
*  And we have to work this out because we are pretending that you have millions and millions of people, you know, living in the shadow and they are here.
*  And we have to work together and figure out a way to get forward because they're here.
*  And it seems incredibly difficult kind of logistics thing.
*  And I think it's it's also un-American to to to round everybody up and who the vast majority of them are just living legal lives and doing a lot of the jobs that other people here would never do.
*  I think we can agree on that.
*  Well, J.D. Vance actually talked about that the other day when he was here.
*  He was explaining how there are CEOs of large corporations that want these people to come across because they need cheap labor.
*  And the way to get cheap labor is have people that are illegals working for less than what would be our minimum wage.
*  Well, I'm not aware. I mean, a minimum wage really, it's I think it's it's most incredibly difficult and and violent kind of jobs like, you know, like.
*  And that's like that's jobs that a lot of people don't want.
*  A lot of those those are kind of really rough processing.
*  Yeah, very, you know, rough.
*  Right. And this is the thing that's been said about Springfield, Ohio, that these Haitians that have moved to Springfield, Ohio, this people are complaining about them.
*  But the people that have employed these people of saying, listen, these people are taking jobs that other people that lived in this community don't want.
*  They work very hard and they're very happy that they have this pathway to be in America.
*  I think most people that come here come here because they want a better life for their families.
*  And America is essentially a country that was founded by immigration.
*  I'm I'm a grandchild of immigrants. My I'm here because of immigration.
*  This is we all were. This is an immigrant country, essentially.
*  Yeah. And it's like it's again and like the Haitians, the Haitians, you know, that they're referencing in Ohio and Springfield.
*  I mean, they're not eating dogs. They're not eating pets and those kinds of things.
*  Now, it's reasonable. I mean, I've said the same thing that we have to have a secure border, but it didn't even apply to that situation.
*  That was all a legal situation. That was amnesty.
*  Amnesty, excuse me. And that's because Haiti was it was it was terrible, terrible, terrible situation.
*  And to me, they were doing those jobs and Republicans, you know, even the the Republican governor was saying, like, these are good workers.
*  This is not the problem. They aren't eating geese.
*  And it's just like you can be very pro pro border like I am, or you can be very strict on immigration.
*  But you don't have to demonize or try to turn a group of people in that they're eating your dog.
*  Well, they're eating ducks and eating. Look, I'm sure some people have done that.
*  You know, you know why I know that? Because some people do that in places that are just Americans.
*  Ducks are edible and some people want to eat a duck.
*  And it's just like you're not going to stop it. But that's not the major problem that people face.
*  So this is the pro side of it. Right.
*  The pro side of it is you give a pathway to people that are from very unfortunate circumstances.
*  And I think we would both agree that if we were living in those countries and there was a pathway to citizenship in the United States, all you had to do is make it across the border.
*  We would both do it. It was better for our families. It was better for our future.
*  If we were living in a place that had no hope and no future and all you had to do is make it to America and you could work, we would all do it.
*  I would do it. You would do it. I bet everybody listening to this would do it if they found themselves in that circumstance.
*  That's the best aspect of it. The best aspect of it is good people that are ambitious, that want a better life, which is how this country was founded.
*  The worst aspect of it is Venezuelan gangs are taking over apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado and San Antonio, Texas.
*  That's the worst aspect of it is that they're letting in gang members, Venezuelans emptied out their prisons and essentially, according to the president, Mariel Boatlift, you know, the whole right.
*  What happened in Cuba? Yeah, the same kind of deal.
*  Emptying out their prisons and instructing these people to make it to America.
*  This is a significant problem with the open border. Yeah.
*  And that's why we need a secure border. And there's also, and all of this is about a truth, is that America is a beacon to the world.
*  Millions of people, the demand to become a citizen here or to participate in our amazing society, the demand outstrips the space there and we're already the very pro immigration.
*  We allow more kinds of a path more than any other nations in the world on that.
*  And people are willing to die and they put themselves at risk just to kind of get here to be able to spot here.
*  So America isn't the problem. America is one of the great hopes in the world.
*  And that's why so many people want to come be a part of that. And that's why it has to have an effective border.
*  And it's like if we had a real issue here and we wanted to address that.
*  And that's why, you know, my my former professor said that you're never going to have the kind of a deal because it is useful for both sides to weaponize that and to demonize one side or turn the other thing in there because it's a serious, important issue.
*  It's a political talking point that they're always going to use. That's what you're saying.
*  It's useful. I mean, it's it's weapon. It's weapon. It's weaponized.
*  And that's why you have to have an honest conversation.
*  I think I've always I was reaching out saying that was referred to H.R. one.
*  And that that was like kind of like the dream kind of immigration law coming out of the house.
*  And I was like, hey, if that border deal goes down, then it's like, hey, we should continue to have that conversation.
*  Right. You know, it's like they're parts of their parts.
*  But what's contradictory is that, say, if you're coming from Canada or Europe and you're a highly skilled college educated person who wants to live in America and become a United States citizen, the path to citizenship is incredibly difficult.
*  It's hard. You have to go up for review.
*  You have to show that you're doing something that Americans can't do.
*  You have to be a person of significant talent or ability.
*  There's something about you that we want you in here.
*  Yet if you just make it across the border and walk in, people want to give you amnesty and they want to allow you a path to citizenship quickly without any of those hoops.
*  You don't have to take tests. You don't have to go up for review.
*  Not only that, but once you get here, once you apply for amnesty, there's a significant wait period where you're allowed to maintain your residence in this country.
*  It's between seven and sometimes longer years.
*  Yeah, well, we have to figure out what's the way.
*  Well, that's kind of crazy, though, isn't it?
*  But the fact is we have we have an issue.
*  We have millions of people here and the vast majority of them are living legal kinds of lives.
*  And what would you do if you were the president?
*  Let's imagine President Fetterman has to deal with this issue.
*  You want to address the American people.
*  What do you think should be done?
*  Again, having that I would have the same conversation to the Congress and to American people like I'm having right now as well, too.
*  Like, you know, I think it's two things can be true at the same time.
*  You can be very pro immigration.
*  I wouldn't have the beautiful family that I have if it wasn't for, you know, challenges and issues with immigration.
*  But then we have to figure out a way that we can marry a successful way that we can we can combine.
*  You know, I think I personally I do think immigration is really one of our secret weapons.
*  I think that's what makes America so so strong.
*  I agree with you. Yeah, I do.
*  That's made it ambitious. People want a better life.
*  I mean, that's literally how we're founded.
*  That's what I mean. Do you see people trying to to to live illegally in India or Russia?
*  You don't see people try to make it right.
*  Nations like that. I mean, that's a good point.
*  I mean, it's in some sense, it's it's in a weird way.
*  It's like kind of a kind of a it's a significant but a good problem to have because we have we're such an amazing nation.
*  Yes.
*  Agreed. Yeah.
*  But if I'm if I'm President Fetterman, I'm like, hey, we got to figure this out.
*  We got to figure this out.
*  I'm not going to demonize.
*  I'm not going to demonize the Republicans and say that you're xenophobic.
*  I mean, the second you start calling somebody you're a xenophobic, you're it's like within the conversation is going to shut down.
*  Right. Right.
*  And I'm saying I've I it's like for a serious conversation requires serious people.
*  And the second the second and that's when you talk about unlimited money.
*  And it's like suddenly you're like, I mean, I had I had gigantic billboards saying Fetterman equals, you know, open borders and Fetterman.
*  You know, like it's just like, you know, I get turned into, you know, like a Marxist.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Just that's all these kinds of things.
*  And it's just like and of course, that was never true.
*  And then when I had the opportunity, because, you know, as I'm a senator and we have that kinds of legislation in front of me, I'm like, yes, we need to have a serious ones.
*  And now people are like, we're shocked.
*  They're like, oh, wait a minute.
*  I thought they told us that he was all like border and open up and whatever.
*  And it's just not true.
*  Well, that's the problem with people building a fake narrative around your actual opinions.
*  And I think people have been shocked by you.
*  And we've actually talked about on the podcast over the last couple of years.
*  You say very reasonable things, very reasonable, honest things.
*  Yeah, that's the thing.
*  And it's rare for politicians.
*  I'm eager to talk to anyone.
*  And it's like I like I mean, I was thrilled to be here.
*  And I've been a longtime fan of yours.
*  And it's like these are the kinds of, you know, like we parts of times we become too fragile.
*  They are like, oh, they're not allowed to talk about those things.
*  You're not allowed to have these kinds of conversation.
*  I never understood why that that's that's really a problem.
*  But but it's like when people discover it's like, well, hey, he seems to be kind of reasonable or me.
*  I disagree with some things, but he's not what a hundred million dollars, you know,
*  train me to think that that's what's right.
*  The propaganda. So like what do you think could be done if you were President Fetterman?
*  Let's bring it back to that. What would you do about the border?
*  Like how do you secure the border but also allow a pathway for people to pursue their hopes and dreams in the United States?
*  Yeah, I would I would have, you know, for me, I would have started with the H.R.2.
*  And there are elements that are they're just not palatable to their members of my colleagues that, you know,
*  that they come from, you know, more more deep blue states.
*  And that becomes it's not palatable to some people.
*  How do you secure the border? How would that be done?
*  Well, I mean, it's it's just it's got to have it.
*  You know, the best border deal is is the is the only one that can pass.
*  And and if you know, you know, H.R.2 H.R.2 was described as like kind of like, you know, I joke I call that the the only fans list of what Republicans went for for immigration.
*  Why would you only fans wish list? You know, they're kind of like this is what we all want.
*  You know, but you know, it's like the only fans.
*  This is this is what we want. And that was never going to pass.
*  What do you mean by that? That was never going to pass.
*  That was never going to pass. That was like what every Republicans on the House, you know, the hard the hardliners that that's what it was.
*  And they passed it because in this cycle, the Republicans have the majority in the House.
*  And now they put that up and that's never going to pass in the Senate because we have control.
*  And then that kind of got sidelined.
*  And then when everything kind of came together and that was the A deal that was for Ukraine, for Israel and China, a lot of other stuff.
*  And then and then the Republicans tied the border to to passing that.
*  And and there were some people that were frustrated saying, hey, no, no, that's that's that's that's that's one of the more frustrating things about bills is that you can take a bill
*  about an issue, say energy or whatever immigration and attach a bunch of other stuff like support for foreign aid, support for specific wars or whatever it is.
*  You could throw a bunch of stuff in there that really shouldn't be in there.
*  And then you have these bills that are two thousand pages long and no one's really reading them.
*  I thought well, I thought it was reasonable. I thought it was reasonable to have that conversation.
*  I'm like, yeah, let's have that conversation.
*  I mean, because for me, it was about security and for that aid that aid bill that was for me.
*  And I think that was that was our global war on democracy.
*  Right. You know, whether it's Ukraine, whether it's in Israel and China and clearly what their intent for China is on Taiwan and all that's coming.
*  And that's really what's under assault. It's undeniable that democracy is under under attack.
*  And that's why I'm like, hey, we got to stand and we got to push back against that.
*  And now and now and like, hey, we need to have a secure border.
*  So let's put everything together. And we reached that we actually reached that.
*  And and it took months. It literally took months.
*  But give me your utopian version of it. Like, let's assume that you could just get this passed.
*  What would you do? What would you do to secure the border but also provide a pathway to people that want a better life?
*  It's only going to have to be a negotiating way that's palatable to both sides.
*  I understand that. But what would you do if you knew you could just get something through without this negotiation?
*  What do you think could be done? What's the best version of it?
*  What's the utopian version for John Fetterman?
*  Well, again, I think eventually if you are living your best lives and you're following the law and you're you know, and you really just showed up because,
*  hey, I have no path for a life that I would want for my kids.
*  You know, it's like and that's to me that's very American.
*  And remember what's in this in the what's inside the Statue of Liberty.
*  It's like send us, you know, our tired huddled masses to them.
*  It wasn't just, hey, send in the Ph.D.s and the right, you know, and those kinds of things.
*  I mean, that's what really made our nation. And, you know, the steel industry, the steel industry, you know, in my part of the state that came from it was European.
*  It was all kinds of immigrants. They all came in.
*  They couldn't build the houses fast enough. And that was all foreign labor.
*  And they a lot of them were sacrificed because it was an incredibly dangerous business in the steel industry.
*  And that that built our nation and that became part of our society.
*  And that's really every every kinds of wave, you know, and that.
*  And to me, America has to be open and a path for anyone that's are playing by the rules because the group that you're from or the part of you all started the same kind of a process.
*  It's inevitable that that's that's the enduring truth.
*  And that's what made America special. And they made us make us strong.
*  I agree with you. So but what could physically be done to secure the border?
*  I mean, the wall was sort of dismissed during the Trump administration, but it was also discussed during the Obama administration.
*  Even Bill Clinton talked about the importance of having secure borders.
*  What could be done physically to secure the border?
*  Yeah, well, again, because that it's like that becomes that becomes like a third rail.
*  We can't talk about this or let's just I understand that politically, but let's just assume that that's not an issue.
*  What would you want to do?
*  Well, it's like I would want to make sure that we first we have to acknowledge the truth.
*  It's like immigration has been an issue because America is an amazing country.
*  And they're coming from broken countries where they've all recognized that there's not a meaningful path for them to have a quality of life.
*  And they're willing to risk their lives.
*  And sometimes they even drown. And it's like, I can't imagine turning turning.
*  Could you imagine turning your children over to a coyote?
*  And, you know, they're going to go like like if you're trying to leave, imagine I like, hey, in Pennsylvania, it's like walking to North Carolina with your kids on your back.
*  I mean, it's like these are desperate kinds of situations.
*  And it wasn't an invasion in that sense. It was just people wanting to have a part of the American dream.
*  100%
*  And acknowledging where that's at. And it needs to have a path.
*  Otherwise, you're going to have to round up and that's not realistic and there's not the resources.
*  And and that's going to be incredibly disruptive and it's going to be damaging economically as well, too.
*  So how do you provide a pathway while also security?
*  In my respect.
*  How do you provide a pathway while also securing the border?
*  Well, we were to me, I think we can chew gum and walk at the same time on this.
*  And it's not going to be perfect. It's going to be messy. And it's not going to be right.
*  But what would that look like?
*  Whether there's a was actually a barrier or hiring thousands and thousands of more agents and whatever that it takes on that.
*  And it's like the best border deal in that situation is the best one that can that can be that can pass.
*  Right. Because because otherwise, you know, like, boy, if I could wake up with a perfect head of hair or, you know, I could, you know, it's like, you know, but it's it's like, you know, practicing the possible.
*  And we were as close as we've ever game in years and years.
*  And that never came into.
*  I understand what you're saying that it has to pass.
*  But what I'm saying is, imagine that wasn't the case.
*  What could be done? Like if we could all agree, we put politics aside and say, you know what?
*  Everything John Fetterman is saying makes total sense.
*  We have to put that we do need a pathway for these people.
*  It is a beautiful part of America.
*  The reason why people come here in the first place is because it's the land of opportunity.
*  But yet we also have to keep Venezuelan gangs and prisoners from coming across and murderers and gang members and cartel.
*  Yeah. And we have to we have to weed them out and we have to we have to deport them.
*  You know, we absolutely it's like this is how do you find them and how do you deport them?
*  What's that? How do you find them and how do you deport them?
*  Well, again, that's just like taking taking some kind of an inventory of like who's actually here on this.
*  And we have to figure out who's actually here on those kinds of a thing.
*  And and and there are going to be, you know, it's statistically that's a fact that out of X million people, for example, you know, it's a fact that statistically that some that thinks terrible things are going to be perpetrated by those things.
*  And, you know, statistically, in some sense, that Native Americans, not, you know, like not not not the right.
*  But American citizens, you know, and the criminality, if anything, the criminality is slightly higher, you know, in immigration communities as well.
*  And some of the most pro pro American kinds of views that's that's that's projected in those kinds of communities.
*  I mean, just like the community that that brought my wife and their family to this to this country.
*  And that's that's kind of where we're at. And I think what we're seeing now in this cycle, there are more and more Latinos that are, you know, they're changing their views on some of those.
*  They're like, hey, we do need we do need a secure border on that.
*  It's not necessarily assumed that because you are a member of a demographic that that it has to it's all it's not necessarily consistent that it's going to be strong blue kinds of.
*  But we all want safety, right?
*  We all want safety. We all want to minimize crime.
*  Everyone, of course, everyone.
*  Yeah. So you want a secure border to keep criminals from coming over here.
*  That's the major the major impediment.
*  Yeah, of course. And and a secure border with more and more resources put on that.
*  And that makes it but it's it's impossible to make sure that, of course, you're going to have members of the immigration community that are going to commit kinds of terrible kinds of crimes.
*  And you're going to see and those are going to be talked about in the popular media as well.
*  It's undeniable. And I mean, they're incredibly tragic.
*  And it's it's it's it's a fact. And that's actually the truth of the American story.
*  Immigration made our nation and there were hard truths.
*  And we have a hard truth right now. And we need to have a secure border.
*  And we have to find a way to celebrate our immigrations and the kinds of what immigrations and the contributions that they made to this nation and also to weed out or to minimize the kinds of negative kinds of things and those kinds of resources because we can't possibly support an unchecked kinds of a situation that we had.
*  And I described that if you had three hundred thousand people showing up at the border, well, that's the side of Pittsburgh in a month.
*  You know, in a month, like where are they going to go? You know, how are we going to give them an American dream already?
*  Because they're all going to need to certain kinds of resources.
*  And that should never be controversial to say it's like we can't that's not sustainable.
*  And it's like if we want for every immigrant their American dream, it's impossible if it's if it's unchecked like that.
*  And it shouldn't be controversial to anyone politically.
*  No, it's just reasonable. You're saying it's reasonable.
*  What could be done and who do you think is going to do a better job to boost our economy?
*  Well, I think it's undeniable, too.
*  And, you know, I'm certainly not going to discount some of the experience of some people that have been hit by eggs or other things or inflation.
*  But right now, our economy right now, it's really it's the world's envy throughout all those things by any metric.
*  It's our unemployment, the stock market and the hundreds of thousands of new jobs that are being created through it, all those things.
*  And our inflation has been kind of eased back into the check.
*  But it's undeniable that there was an incredible inflation that hit certain kinds of families hard through those things.
*  And I think that the next kinds of wave, whether it's A.I. or those other kinds of innovations,
*  whether that it's it's green energy or those kinds of a thing, that's going to continue to juice our our economy.
*  Well, A.I. is a big fear, right?
*  Because A.I. is going to come with automation and automation is going to come with removing jobs.
*  That is a challenge. On my walk here.
*  Well, I didn't walk here, but I saw I saw a Waymo.
*  A Waymo drove by me and there was I'm like, wait a minute, there's no one in there.
*  No one in there. There was no one in that car.
*  Did you see the traffic jam?
*  Yeah, that's the first time I've ever seen a car and had literally no human was in that vehicle.
*  And I was like, wow, there's a bunch of them around Austin.
*  And there was a traffic jam in Austin where they all got together.
*  We used to have intersection and no one knew what to do.
*  All the robots were just like clogging up this intersection.
*  Yeah, like a lot of that came from Pittsburgh, too.
*  And you would see those kinds of cars, but it always had a human in there.
*  But that was the first time I saw like a robot car driving around in Austin.
*  And yes, that creates there's a lot of dislocation that's possible.
*  And that's just the beginning. It's going to be shipping.
*  It's going to be truckers.
*  I mean, that was a big issue with the longshoremen and the teamsters that were going to go on strike.
*  Yeah, please have some more water.
*  Thank you.
*  You're welcome.
*  I mean, that was a big part of one of their demands was that they see what's going on in China.
*  They see that they're using automation to completely control shipping yards,
*  that it's all done with machines and computers now.
*  And this is going to displace a lot of people.
*  This is something that Andrew Yang talked about in depth when he was running for president
*  because he was talking about the need for some kind of universal basic income
*  to provide people with money and food and housing,
*  because jobs are going to be non-existent in a lot of different sectors, a lot of different markets,
*  a lot of different things that have traditionally been done by people, specifically driving.
*  Driving is going to be a gigantic one. It's all going to be done by computers.
*  Yeah, well, I mean, universal guaranteed income, I'm not sure.
*  I don't know, because you're going to have to have a lot of resources to provide a lot of that.
*  And that creates all kinds of other issues and dynamic.
*  But I'm not afraid of technology, but it's also acknowledging that there are going to be kinds of changes in those things.
*  And I'm a big believer in technology takes us into a more productive kinds of economy,
*  and they're going to help solve some of the challenges that we have in our society for those kinds of things.
*  But I think we have to find the perfect balance that we don't stifle innovation.
*  But we also have to remember that there are going to be people that might be left behind or they're going to struggle.
*  I mean, hey, I was mayor for 13 days and I live in a community that was left behind by some of those things.
*  And now the steelworkers, the steelworkers, I live across the street from the steel mill.
*  And then it was announced that Nippon was buying US Steel.
*  And basically all those steelworkers, they were done.
*  You know, they used euphemism saying, well, we're going to honor current label, excuse me, labor deals.
*  But that's a euphemism saying as soon as that's up, you're done.
*  Right. And then that's going to be, you know, thousands of union jobs.
*  And if you think it's going to be easy for those men and women to pull down six figures or those kinds of an income,
*  it's like, you know, how insensitive to say, well, hey, learn coding or whatever.
*  It's like, well, hey, it's no it's not. Coding is useless anyway.
*  When AI learning to code is going to be useless. Yeah, exactly.
*  That's how quickly things change. It's basically kind of like a fuck you.
*  Like good luck kind of thing. Well, it's such a it's a dumb fuck you too, because even when they said learn to code,
*  like that was like, you know, they're saying, hey, you could learn to code. I'm not going to learn.
*  But here's the thing. Even if you did, that's how quickly things change.
*  Even if you did. Now they're telling kids learning coding in universities is not necessarily going to be a pathway to a job,
*  because all coding is going to be done by artificial intelligence.
*  Yeah. Well, but but, you know, I they never even told us that they were going to sell that.
*  And then a staffer sent me a picture on CNN saying that they're they're selling UST.
*  I'm like, fuck that. And so I just went up on my roof and I had a video saying, hey, I promise I'm going to do anything.
*  I can't to to to jam that up. And it's like that's what we did.
*  And we work with the White House. And then suddenly all of that got jammed up.
*  And suddenly I'm so surprised. Wink on wink. But Nippon found extra billions of dollars to make the kinds of upgrades
*  to secure a future for those facilities in the Mon Valley.
*  And to me, it's about following the union way of life. You know, to me, steel is national security.
*  And to me, if you turn your back on the working union families, I mean, it's like this it's it's those are really hard to replace those things.
*  And so for me, two things are true at the same time. You know, our economy has evolved.
*  But when we have an opportunity to stand for the union way of life and we can't ever just outsource, you know, our steel industry like that, I refuse to do that.
*  So and that's why we're in that situation right now, that it's like, hey, it's like that that's what's true about some of these industries.
*  One of the things that I was reading that was really crazy. And I'd love you to find out how much of this is accurate, Jamie.
*  One of the things was this guy was explaining how scrap metal in the United States was shipped to China where they make things with it instead of making things here.
*  Because and then we buy what they make with our scrap metal, which seems to me kind of insane.
*  The death of American manufacturing is a significant problem that we faced.
*  And it was really highlighted during covid right where there wasn't ships coming in because everything was kind of locked down for a while.
*  And people realize like, hey, so much of what we need, particularly computer chips and medicine, so much of what we need is being made overseas.
*  I agree. And then that's and that's why, you know, Congress came together and President Biden led the whole chips, the whole chips legislation.
*  And it's like we got to make our we got to make shit in America. Right.
*  And it's like, of course, the future is in those kinds of industries and those things.
*  So we got to we have to protect the American economy for that thing.
*  And and that's why that's a bipartisan kinds of of a push for that.
*  And and the and covid that relieved a lot of vulnerable vulnerabilities.
*  It's like where a lot of these things come from or so.
*  But but going going forward on that, it's like we can never just surrender that American manufacturing.
*  We can't assume and we can't allow that to turn completely outsourced.
*  No, it would be horrible. And it would be nice to bring things back.
*  And it's also, you know, one of the things we've been discussing a lot is that so many of the things that we need today, like particularly phones, are being made in an unethical way.
*  Like where we would never allow the working conditions that exist in these factories overseas where American corporations are having their products made in a way that you would never legally be able to do in America.
*  And yet they're doing this just to make more money.
*  And then, well, I mean, let's also talk about rare, rare, rare, rare earth stuff.
*  Yeah, the Chinese have strategically just, you know, snapped up that markets.
*  I mean, that's really that's a significant security issue.
*  We're going to have to we're going to have to address that.
*  And thankfully, thankfully, we have identified of some large deposits.
*  I think it was Nevada. But but rare earth kinds of minerals.
*  And that's a serious security issue because the new economy and a lot of the new technology is going to depend on those kinds of incredibly.
*  I think a lot of kinds of minerals that some people have never even heard in their life have no idea what that even why that's important.
*  Right. And then oil as well.
*  I mean, we have significant oil reserves in the United States.
*  Apparently, we have more oil than other countries do.
*  It's just a matter of accessing it.
*  So are you in favor of drilling for oil and fracking and all these different things to?
*  Yeah, one hundred percent.
*  And that that that's that's what's also true is especially what happened after after Russia invaded.
*  And it was very clear that Europe had have Russians kind of by the short hairs that a lot of their Europe was they were dependent on some of the Russian gas.
*  And that's a fact, too.
*  And, you know, it's also it's also what's true is that fossil fuels are part of our energy stack.
*  You know, our energy has to evolve, whether that's hydrogen or nuclear.
*  Now, even nuclear, that conversation is reemerging.
*  You know, I grew up in South Pennsylvania.
*  Maybe you've heard of three islands or three.
*  I had to evacuate when that happened.
*  I was really. Yeah, I had to evacuate.
*  Wow. Because they could they could have turned.
*  You know, we could have never returned.
*  I mean, that was really tense.
*  Now they're reopening that because Microsoft is going to buy the electricity because now that's going to be nuclear to to run the data centers.
*  And those things, it's an important conversation.
*  So if you are committed, and I think it's I do believe that you really have to make sure that nuclear is part of that conversation, too, because, you know, zero, zero kinds of emissions.
*  And that's dependable kinds of energy that doesn't depend on the wind or the sun.
*  But ironically, some people pretend that you have to have a conversation.
*  So but, you know, for the foreseeable future, that fossil fuels are part of our stack.
*  And for me, energy security is it's very important.
*  You know, national security.
*  I mean, like if we can't if we can't power our economy, then it's going to that's a significant risk for our economy in our American way.
*  And and now we I think we're a net exporter of energy.
*  So I think that's a that's a good thing.
*  I think that's a great way to be.
*  And it's being honest about that and the path forward.
*  And and I think we you know, everything has to be on the table because we have to have a portfolio that produces the kinds of energy that we're going to need to power our economy.
*  Another significant issue that a lot of people are concerned about is government interference in online censorship and what what was exposed during the Twitter files that the FBI had contacted the original owners of Twitter and prevented that or instructed them that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation, was trying to get certain accounts banned that were talking about covid vaccines and the dangers of side effects.
*  And what the actual research was showing and that this was a significant interference in the First Amendment and that these corporations that were running these social media companies were being directly influenced by the federal government.
*  And they were using this power to silence people from speaking out against certain things.
*  This is this is very concerning to a lot of people.
*  This idea that the government would infringe on our ability to be whistleblowers to expose issues that have been hidden from the American people because of greed and money and politics.
*  What are your thoughts on that?
*  Well, of course, I mean, I'm a I'm a free speech kind of person.
*  And I think social media is it's it's kind of difficult to control there.
*  There's a difference between misinformation or just outright lying or it's an agenda of a foreign nation that's trying to sow all these kinds of sentiments and those kinds of of things.
*  And and it's kind of difficult to police all those things.
*  And it's a lot of it's an ongoing kind of of a situation.
*  So but I'm always going to try to err on the side of free speech.
*  And then there's incredibly more and more kinds of platforms just like one I'm on right now talking about these kinds of things.
*  And I am not clutching my pearls if there's having conversations that I may or may not agree or disagree on what's being talked about those things.
*  But I think people are also there's also a level of responsibility to be to discern what you're hearing.
*  It's like, I think that's true or I think that's trash or it's like those kinds of thing.
*  And just because always asking myself in what I'm read, is that just true or is there a perspective?
*  Where is it coming from? Who's behind those kinds of a thing?
*  So, I mean, it's a difficult kinds of what's the appropriate kind of balance.
*  But it's absolutely it's also a fact that there are bad actors behind some of those kinds of conversations or some of those kinds of misinformation as well, too.
*  And absolutely incitement incitement is not free speech and encouraging people for for violence or those kinds of a thing.
*  I mean, it's it's it's a it's dangerous.
*  It's dangerous. Yeah.
*  And but what the fear is that the government was interfering when you had 51 former intelligence agents that were testifying that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation,
*  when it seems pretty clear that they knew that to not be true and that Twitter actually listened to these people and they did block that.
*  And it did probably have a significant impact on the 2020 election.
*  Yeah. Well, but the other thing that had a significant impact was in 2020.
*  I forget his name, but he had to investigate, you know, Clinton's about the homies.
*  Yeah. Like, you know, two weeks out, that was like the ultimate October surprise.
*  And that undeniable that had a significant impact.
*  That was the 2016.
*  It absolutely did as well, too.
*  So, I mean, that's why there's both sides and they have agendas to suppress some kinds of a thing or to bring something to the front.
*  And it's undeniable that it can have an impact on that as well, too.
*  I never went down either of those rabbit holes, whether it was the Clinton emails or if it was the Hunter Biden's kind of laptop.
*  So, but it hasn't really changed overall the dynamic that in our cycles, the last three cycles, it's really it's about for me, it's about a referendum on what we want a vision for America.
*  Is it a Trump kinds of a vision or do we have an alternative?
*  And I've always been very clear it's going to be incredibly close and it's going to be incredibly at times very divisive.
*  And and here we are now and it's still back to a coin toss.
*  And I've always predicted that it would be even back to 2016 because we're really going to have a lot settled out before this election.
*  It's going to take America in a very too stark and distinctive kinds of directions.
*  What do you think about Elon Musk's idea of creating a government efficiency agency?
*  Well, hey, I flagged.
*  When Musk when Musk got involved, I flagged that anyone can look online.
*  I can say that it's like, well, you know, endorsements and surrogacy doesn't really amount for much.
*  It doesn't count for much a lot.
*  And sometimes. But I mean, that was a that was a significant and he's getting involved and he's showing up at those kinds of events.
*  I mean, in some sense, I've said this publicly that he's even a bigger kinds of star than Trump can be.
*  And for some people in Pennsylvania, like that's Tony Stark.
*  He's involved in undeniably kinds of important things like SpaceX, or he was one of the original charter using the charter of Open IA.
*  He was involved in that too.
*  So, I mean, that's that's significant.
*  And and I don't agree with some of his some of his views on politics, but it's undeniable that he can move the needle in some sense of of convinced some people that it's like, hey, if he says that he's the right choice for president, that that's gonna that's gonna that's gonna resonate in some in some circles in Pennsylvania.
*  And I've I've worn that and acknowledging it.
*  It's just like that. That's it's just like, hey, I know people and they admire him and you may not agree with his politics, but you really it's impossible to ignore that he is going to have a level of of impact on that.
*  Yeah.
*  But what do you think about the idea of trying to make the government more efficient and that this hasn't been audited before?
*  And of course, I, hey, I'm open to any kinds of ideas and all those kinds of a thing on all of that.
*  One side doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas or important kinds of issues that that are that are matter to them.
*  So, and it's like the choices and the kinds of things and how he's chosen to participate, especially and very personally in Pennsylvania.
*  I'm like, hey, here's where we are. That's part of the dynamic here, you know, calling it out and acknowledging that I'm not moving against that.
*  I'm not criticizing whatever. It's just like, hey, it's happening.
*  So and that I think that's part of why things continue to get tighter.
*  And that that's that's kind of here we where we are.
*  Well, I think what a lot of people are excited about with Trump is this possibility of change.
*  The Elon Musk edition is one of them.
*  Or R.F.K. Junior is another one. This idea of making America healthy again, removing additives from foods that have shown to be toxic.
*  They're illegal in other countries.
*  I mean, this is a I think a significant issue that shouldn't be a partisan issue.
*  This should be something that we all should be concerned with.
*  Why do we have ingredients in our food that is illegal in a bunch of European countries because they found out that these things are dangerous?
*  I agree. You know, go to McDonald's and like the UK, you know, the French fries has three ingredients, potatoes, salt, and I think maybe oil.
*  And look at look at what's in America side on that. It's much different.
*  I support that. But if anything, if it's anything, you know, more of and I know I know your city that we're in now, Austin has an amazing food kinds of scene.
*  And and again, you know, if anything, more of the crunchy, more liberal side, we're on part of the whole organic kinds of thing and more impurity and things.
*  I don't think that's an issue. And honestly, I don't think that that's going to be the kind of mantle that somebody like, you know, R.F.K. Junior.
*  That's not his. So I think having a more pure and safe and abundant kinds of food in in our country, I absolutely support that.
*  And, you know, I'm I'm selective. Would I would I feed I feed my children?
*  I mean, when we were, you know, when I was a kid, it was like Velveeta, you know, like, hey, now we have real cheese.
*  Or did you ever have like Ecto cooler like that green like antifreeze kind of color of high C and some of the kinds of foods that we had when I was a kid?
*  That would be unthinkable kinds of now. And I think I think the quality of our food and and kinds of more impure.
*  I think that's that's been an ongoing conversation.
*  And organic can't become elitist.
*  It can't be it can't be too expensive.
*  And I fully support making it more and more more and more pure and more safe on that and more available.
*  And I would absolutely I would celebrate if I could buy the same french fries that you get in the UK that I think there's you don't need more than three ingredients.
*  I have a buddy of mine who lives in Australia and he came over to America and he loves quarter pounders in Australia because he said quarter pounders in Australia.
*  It's grass fed meat that's just fried with cheese and a bun.
*  And he said he got a quarter pounder over here. He's like, what the fuck is this?
*  He said it tastes like shit. It was just it was bland and it didn't roll with cheese.
*  I don't know what they call it in Australia, but he said it's grass fed beef.
*  You get like, you know, they're not even feeding their cows grain.
*  Well, you know, a lot of the the grass fed beef in and in our nation are coming from Australia.
*  I mean, it's crazy. Yeah, that's that's a fact.
*  And I'm very pro pro-American rancher.
*  Well, not only that, it's it's really fucked up because you could make it a product of America if you butcher it here.
*  So if you import cattle from Australia, say, and then you bring it to America and then you cut it up and then package it because you've cut it up and packaged it is now a product of America.
*  So you could write that on the label.
*  You know, I had Will Harris, who runs White Oak Pastures, which is a regenerative farm.
*  This guy spent 20 years and untold dollars changing an industrial farm that his family had and turning it into a regenerative farm.
*  And in doing so, provided people with a much more natural and healthy choice.
*  And he's also done a great job of exposing these practices.
*  Yeah, I mean, grass grass fed beef. I mean, I think that's I think that's very in some sense.
*  And that's that that absolutely supports better health.
*  I mean, I was I I followed before he even appeared on your on your podcast, Sean Baker.
*  Yeah, yeah. Like a carnivore.
*  And even those kinds of insights helped me personally and allowed me to kind of drop some drop some weight through all those things.
*  And, you know, it's like that's an important conversation, too.
*  But but Democrats, some people think that were declared a war on hamburgers and beef.
*  But we're definitely going to lose that.
*  They're going to lose that if that really becomes part of that.
*  And I don't think that's Democrats.
*  I think that's very wealthy people that have a financial interest in feeding people fake meat.
*  That's what I think it is. And I think they've captured the system.
*  I said it pains me to agree with with DeSantis, you know, because they passed the ban in that in Florida.
*  It pains me to agree with them.
*  But it's like I mean, I would never feed I would never feed that slop to my kids when you can buy, you know, quality American grass fed American beef.
*  Like, I mean, that's that's what I purchased that I use that at Costco.
*  I buy the three pack of it.
*  And and and I my my oldest son, he knows how to to prepare like his own rib eye.
*  And and he's, you know, makes that a part of like a I think it's like a healthy kinds of a diet.
*  Yeah, for sure. What other issues do you think we should discuss before we wrap this up?
*  Is there anything else that's on your mind that you think is significant that needs to be discussed?
*  Oh, before you wrap up, I well, I think we have a situation where there's the situation on on on Israel or those there's there's a lot happening about the election right now.
*  But but it's really a strange place in our nation right now.
*  But I promise you, it's going to be depending on whenever people hear this conversation, our world's going to be about to change or maybe has changed.
*  And so I just hope, though, I just hope, though, that we're going to be able to respond in a way for an order kinds of transfer of power.
*  And we are going to be heading into a more peaceful and a more productive and collaborative kind of direction throughout that.
*  But we're in an incredibly divisible place right now.
*  And I just want to be part of a conversation to make sure that we can be more constructive.
*  But it's right now we're kind of it's it's a difficult place right now.
*  And we're coming down to a coin toss election.
*  Yeah, I agree. I hope we can all relax and work together cooperatively.
*  Yeah. Well, listen, man, thank you for being here.
*  I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to come here and talk.
*  It's been great to get to know you and have a conversation with you.
*  Oh, hey, well, hey, thank you for having it.
*  It's it's as a fan, it's great to kind of visit.
*  And so thanks for having me.
*  So my pleasure. All right. Best of luck to you.
*  Thank you. All right. Bye, everybody.
*  Bye.
