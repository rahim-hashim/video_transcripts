# Joe Rogan Experience #2313 - Jillian Michaels
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  You too. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  We were just talking about boomers, about parents, parents that they don't want to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  believe anything other than what they're getting from the news. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=20.34s)]
*  It's been a challenge. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=24.900000000000002s)]
*  My dad is an absolute lost cause. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=25.900000000000002s)]
*  My mom is now open to the conversation and she'll send me a bunch of different articles [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=28.04s)]
*  and then she'll allow me to disseminate from my perspective. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=33.92s)]
*  But it's been, it's been a rough ride. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=37.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've got them on peptides now, which is nice. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=41.44s)]
*  Same. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  And I've got my stepdad on testosterone replacement, which is nice and he's seeing benefits of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  those things. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  So it's like they're slowly starting to incorporate some of these things. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  But their whole life they've been told that the doctor knows everything and that the news [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  is always correct and anything contrary to the news is bullshit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=60.38s)]
*  But arguably when our parents were our age, it was reliable. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=65.1s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=71.34s)]
*  No? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=72.34s)]
*  No, I think it's always been compromised. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=73.34s)]
*  I just think there was no alternatives. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=74.66s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=76.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I think. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=77.14s)]
*  My mom is a psychoanalyst, PhD. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=78.14s)]
*  This is a very educated, thoughtful woman. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=80.8s)]
*  Sometimes that's the worst. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=86.16s)]
*  No, no. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=87.16s)]
*  I would argue against in this case. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=88.16s)]
*  I do appreciate people who see flaws in psychoanalysis, but I've learned a huge amount from my mom [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  in this area. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  And she also, she majored in journalism before changing careers to psychoanalysis. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=98.08s)]
*  And so for her to even wrap her head around the fact that journalism can be compromised [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=104.0s)]
*  is almost inconceivable. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=110.5s)]
*  I didn't mean psychoanalysis is bad. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=111.5s)]
*  What I meant is that a lot of times educated people defer to other educated people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  Like they're an expert in their field, so they assume that all the other experts in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=118.98s)]
*  their field are also correct. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  And Annie Heretic is just a fool. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  I would happen to agree with that point. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=127.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=130.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=131.5s)]
*  That's why we were talking about Fauci on the way in and both of my parents could arguably [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=132.5s)]
*  canonize the guy, you know, or now I think I've broken through with my mom, but it has [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=137.86s)]
*  taken me since since your episode with Brett Weinstein in March of 2020. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=142.18s)]
*  I have been working on it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=148.1s)]
*  We're getting there though. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=149.82s)]
*  We're there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=151.54s)]
*  We are there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=152.54s)]
*  It's been five years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=153.54s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=155.54s)]
*  That was five years ago. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=156.54s)]
*  It was like yesterday. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=157.54s)]
*  I'll never forget it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=158.54s)]
*  Five years ago. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=159.54s)]
*  And I remember when that episode came out, people were freaking out like, what are you [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=160.74s)]
*  doing? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=163.7s)]
*  What is Brett doing? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=164.7s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=165.7s)]
*  He's all killed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=166.7s)]
*  It made perfect sense to me. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=167.7s)]
*  Well he was right, clearly. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=169.48s)]
*  And yet still, no apologies, no corrections, except the government website. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=171.16s)]
*  The COVID-19 website is now up and this has to be because of Bobby Kennedy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  Hey, I mean, the New York Times was like, Alex, looks like this came from a lab. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  It's like, really? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Well the best part about it was that we were misled. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you were misled by you, you fuckers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=189.6s)]
*  You did it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Isn't that disgusting? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  And there are zero apologies, zero course corrections, and they unveil this information [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=195.06s)]
*  as though they are the purveyors of truth. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  Guys, we got a headline. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=203.62s)]
*  This came from a lab. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=205.62s)]
*  You're a half a decade late. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=207.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=209.01999999999998s)]
*  You know what's really interesting? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  We've been talking about this a lot lately, that imagine if the roles were reversed and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  if podcasters were the ones yelling at everybody to go out and take these experimental shots [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=214.62s)]
*  and then they were experiencing all these complications and all these side effects. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=218.98s)]
*  Some news would be chastising us, like how dare you give people the advice to go out [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=223.78s)]
*  and do this? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=228.52s)]
*  You're responsible for these people having all these side effects and all these unnecessary [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=229.52s)]
*  deaths and all these people that would have had no problem with COVID. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=232.52s)]
*  You encourage them to take this vaccine and they had strokes and they had this and they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=235.48s)]
*  had that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=239.0s)]
*  They'd be calling for us to get shut down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=240.0s)]
*  I actually did that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=242.2s)]
*  I did not know any better and I was pitched a vaccine scientist and I thought like, oh, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=244.0s)]
*  this is great. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=251.04s)]
*  Yeah, come on the show. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=252.04s)]
*  I didn't know the vaccine was gene therapy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=253.44s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=258.06s)]
*  So I knew it came from a lab. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=259.82s)]
*  That made perfect sense to me and I was like, oh, well, this is very clear. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=261.92s)]
*  It's not from a wet market. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=264.78s)]
*  But someone reached out to a producer of mine and said, we've got this person who is a scientist [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=267.48s)]
*  who worked on the vaccine that wants to educate people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=274.7s)]
*  And I thought I was doing this major public service. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=276.7s)]
*  I have had to apologize for that podcast and I've left it up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=279.22s)]
*  What was the scientist? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=282.38s)]
*  I cannot, Joe, I cannot remember her name. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=283.38s)]
*  She was actually young. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=286.78s)]
*  And the reason I remember that she was in her 30s is because she told me, oh, this tech [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  has been around for 30 years. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=291.96s)]
*  And I thought, but you're only you're like 35. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=293.42s)]
*  No, no, we've been we've been evolving this technology for 30 years. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=296.74s)]
*  And you see all of these trials for safety is just bureaucracy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=302.0s)]
*  I didn't understand what it meant to push something through that emergency use loophole [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=307.14s)]
*  at the time. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=312.06s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't understand the difference of, oh, this is a dead pathogen and this is a [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=313.06s)]
*  live pathogen. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=316.9s)]
*  And we're worried about adjuvants. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=317.9s)]
*  But this here, this is gene therapy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=318.9s)]
*  I didn't even begin to comprehend what that was, what it meant, or the fact that we would [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=321.26s)]
*  fuck around with something that was experimental. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=327.66s)]
*  And the scariest part is I had been talking with a woman named Brian Dresden, who was [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=332.1s)]
*  AstraZeneca COVID-19 trials. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=338.82s)]
*  And the NIH was studying all of the people that had been injured during the vaccine trials [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=341.5s)]
*  as they rolled out the vaccine with no concerns and lied about every component from it stays [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  in the shoulder, it's out of the body in 24 hours until you find out, no, it's coated in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=353.82s)]
*  lipid nanoparticles and it could cross the blood brain barrier. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  Oops. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=362.1s)]
*  Now they're finding out that people can still produce spike protein because the injections [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=363.1s)]
*  for over 700 days. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=366.2s)]
*  And you can shed, supposedly. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=367.2s)]
*  Yeah, you give it to your partner. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=368.2s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=371.2s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=372.2s)]
*  And now they're, I mean, I'm certainly not an expert in mRNA tech, but now we're fast [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=373.2s)]
*  tracking other vaccines that utilize the same technology. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=379.64s)]
*  And I know for one, I don't think I'll take an mRNA vaccine ever. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=382.96s)]
*  It scares the crap out of me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=387.56s)]
*  Well, you've heard Brett Weinstein talk about the flaws in just the technology itself and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=389.32s)]
*  the fact that when it gets into your body, if it gets especially, you know, the thing [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=394.67999999999995s)]
*  is nobody aspirated, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  They didn't inject people and pull back to make sure they're not on a blood vessel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=401.52s)]
*  They just plunged it, including when they they did it live with Biden on television, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=405.15999999999997s)]
*  which I don't think that was a vaccine. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=411.23999999999995s)]
*  I said to this day, people are like, yo, well, you conspiracy theorist. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=413.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, I'm telling you right now. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=416.84s)]
*  I think it's a conspiracy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't think they would take a chance in injecting a fucking 80 year old man when you [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=421.08000000000004s)]
*  know that you have to stay there at the clinic for 20 minutes in case you drop dead. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=426.56s)]
*  Someone. Yeah. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=430.92s)]
*  You know, my wife's friend, her friend's son actually had the covid vaccine and the flu [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=431.88s)]
*  vaccine on the same day. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=439.16s)]
*  He did supposedly stay for 15 minutes, got in the car, must have passed out or had a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=441.68s)]
*  seizure, had a truian, died. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=447.16s)]
*  Had a crazy reaction to it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=449.88s)]
*  I know I'm not trying to I'm not trying to promote this anti-vax position, but. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=451.64s)]
*  Well, that's not a vaccine. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=456.6s)]
*  You know, exactly. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=458.28000000000003s)]
*  Calling it a vaccine is fucking crazy. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  Exactly. It was a totally experimental gene therapy. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=461.0s)]
*  And what Brett was saying about it is if you don't aspirate, you're shooting it right [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=464.32s)]
*  into a blood vessel. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=468.68s)]
*  If you're shooting it right into a blood vessel, it could go to all sorts of areas of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=469.72s)]
*  body where the body is going to attack it like it's a disease, particularly the heart. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=474.48s)]
*  And it's like this is why you get myocarditis, because the heart doesn't heal, which is why [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=479.76s)]
*  you don't get heart cancer. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=483.52s)]
*  Your heart just scars over. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=484.8s)]
*  So people have these inflamed enlarged hearts and then diminish cardiovascular function. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  And he was talking about this way earlier than anybody else. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=491.52s)]
*  And they were blood on his hands is killing grandmas. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=496.0s)]
*  And the vaccine saved millions of lives. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=499.28s)]
*  People say that all the time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=501.52s)]
*  They've saved millions of lives. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=502.64s)]
*  Like how? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  If people still got covid, not only that, they got more covid than people that didn't [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=504.8s)]
*  get vaccinated. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=508.72s)]
*  I am still having this this exact debate, actually, with with my mom, who's like, but [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=509.92s)]
*  honey, it saved me. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  And you know, it's crazy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=516.64s)]
*  Have you actually tried to Google that information? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  Because you can make a case for that based on what will come up on Google. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=521.12s)]
*  And she's like, but look right here, it says it saved millions of lives. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  But you know, it's only based on the idea that those people would have died if they [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=528.32s)]
*  didn't have covid. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=533.36s)]
*  And the problem, the problem is you're going to get covid anyway. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=534.64s)]
*  So that data is bullshit. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=537.84s)]
*  Not only that, even when people got covid, ninety nine point oh seven of those fuckers [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=539.6s)]
*  lived. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=547.6s)]
*  I just pulled that up because I was trying to illustrate that point. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  I was like, do you realize that I think the percentage of mortality with this is like [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  one percent? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  And when you look at it, it's considerably less point oh three all the way up till you [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  get about 80 years old. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=563.84s)]
*  And then it's like, well, one percent or so, one point five, maybe an 80 year old or [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=565.2s)]
*  morbidly obese or severely autoimmune, you know, immunocompromised. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=570.72s)]
*  When you have three hundred and thirty million people in this country and then, you know, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  you look at that zero point three percent, that starts looking like a lot of people. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=580.96s)]
*  But those are just people that are on death's door. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  That's the reality. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=589.2800000000001s)]
*  Metabolically unhealthy, obese, diabetes, all sorts of problems, cancer, leukemia on [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=590.4s)]
*  chemotherapy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  Those are the people that died. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=597.92s)]
*  I remember when Bill Maher was talking about how it was people who there was a study that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=599.76s)]
*  came out of the CDC and forgiving is I don't remember the exact percentage, but it was [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=606.4s)]
*  upwards of 80 percent of the people who died or had severe cases of covid were obese or [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=610.0799999999999s)]
*  overweight. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=616.8s)]
*  And this is when you could be healthy at any size. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=618.0s)]
*  That PsiOp was in full effect. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=620.96s)]
*  That must have drove you crazy. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=623.6s)]
*  Oh, I was I was completely unraveling. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=624.8800000000001s)]
*  People ask me like, what happened? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=630.1600000000001s)]
*  You were a good liberal. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=632.24s)]
*  If you go back to the old definition. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=636.72s)]
*  I haven't changed. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=638.6400000000001s)]
*  I go issue by issue with my friends. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=640.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you show me where I've shifted my position on any issue outside of Trump. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  I used to think he was hit Larry and he was going to round up all the gays and we were [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=649.52s)]
*  all fogged. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=653.92s)]
*  None of that happened. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=654.8s)]
*  I thought Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=655.92s)]
*  I thought that was real. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=657.3599999999999s)]
*  So as new evidence came to light and I managed to survive his first term intact along with [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=658.64s)]
*  my gay relationships, I somehow started to feel that maybe a lot of that was [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  bullshit propaganda. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=672.24s)]
*  But outside of that, not one of my positions has changed. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=673.76s)]
*  Not one. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=679.12s)]
*  And I find that arguably the right is more welcoming and more tolerant. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=679.6s)]
*  Now I can sit down and have a conversation with Matt Walsh and debate gay marriage in [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=684.32s)]
*  a civil fashion. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=688.96s)]
*  And I ended up again, like I bring up Bill because I work with Bill in some capacity [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=691.92s)]
*  on his podcast network. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=696.88s)]
*  I was having to defend him on Piers Morgan because he was sitting down with Trump and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=698.72s)]
*  they called him a bigot and a racist and anti-science because he was going to sit with [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=703.5200000000001s)]
*  Trump. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=708.88s)]
*  I'm like, well, where's the outrage that he sits down with Newsom? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=709.5200000000001s)]
*  I hate that guy way more. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=712.88s)]
*  Piers Morgan was saying this or the guests? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=713.12s)]
*  Not Piers. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=714.48s)]
*  Yeah, the guests. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=715.36s)]
*  Piers was awesome. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=716.0s)]
*  Piers' show is Maury Povich 2.0. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=716.96s)]
*  It's a better version of Maury Povich. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=718.96s)]
*  I kind of love it though. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=721.12s)]
*  And I love when I get to do it because you're allowed to act unhinged. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=722.6400000000001s)]
*  You still have to make your points. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=726.48s)]
*  But it is theatrical. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=728.32s)]
*  But sometimes I think when you are able to be so theatrical, it goes viral. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=730.96s)]
*  And the point that you're trying to make is arguably seen by more, unless it's a platform, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=736.24s)]
*  of course, like yours. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=740.48s)]
*  But yeah, he does a good job of that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=741.36s)]
*  I just don't think it's a good way to discuss ideas. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=744.08s)]
*  But it's really good as far as like going viral. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=747.2s)]
*  It's great. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=750.32s)]
*  You're not wrong about that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  I still find it fun though. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=752.32s)]
*  Because what you hold in for all those civil conversations where you're just biting your tongue, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=754.24s)]
*  you're trying to communicate calmly, articulately, here you can just unleash that your hypocrisy is [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  disgusting. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  Everything I swallow in every conversation with all my friends from California. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=774.6400000000001s)]
*  And you can just let it rip and freaking tear into people because they started it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=779.36s)]
*  They started the fight. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=785.76s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=786.96s)]
*  I don't like doing that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  So I'm not interested in that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=789.92s)]
*  I get it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=792.16s)]
*  I'm not interested in that kind of conflict. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to talk to people like that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=797.04s)]
*  I understand. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=797.52s)]
*  And you are like a very gentle soul. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=798.24s)]
*  I watch you sometimes and you're just so, not sometimes, I watch you often and you're [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=801.04s)]
*  very gentle soul. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=805.76s)]
*  And sometimes I think, God, toxic masculinity. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=806.72s)]
*  That whole notion, all of the men in your space tend to be far kinder and softer than [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=812.64s)]
*  it's the women that are savages. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=820.64s)]
*  I mean, I happen to love, I love Megyn Kelly. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  I think she's brilliant, but God damn, I never want to be on the wrong side of her. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=825.12s)]
*  Yeah, she's ruthless. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  She'll rip your head off and like eat your heart. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=829.84s)]
*  Do not fuck with that woman. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=833.2s)]
*  You know, so anyway, I think that some of the women in the space are genuinely more [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  aggressive than the men. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=842.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, do you think that's because they have to to get respect? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=843.76s)]
*  Like, why do you think that is? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=846.56s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  And I find that it's more respectable when you speak in the fashion that you do. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=850.88s)]
*  And I've tried to really curtail that behavior throughout every other aspect of my life, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=856.24s)]
*  personally and professionally, whether I'm fighting with the contractor on my house, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=862.32s)]
*  I try to lower the octaves of my voice or I'm trying to win somebody over in a debate. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=866.08s)]
*  But I think, you know, Joe, honestly, I think because it's entertaining. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=873.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a competitive space. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=876.48s)]
*  Yeah, I really think that's it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=878.4000000000001s)]
*  And it seems to work. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=880.32s)]
*  So sort of. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  But why am I number one then? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=882.96s)]
*  Because I don't do it. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=884.32s)]
*  Because that see, that's like the counter argument. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=886.0s)]
*  Here would be my answer, because you can lick everything in the fridge. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=888.88s)]
*  And what I mean by that is you don't have a niche. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=893.7600000000001s)]
*  Seriously, I'm not kidding. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=897.2s)]
*  I've never heard that expression before. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  You can talk about anything and everything. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=899.84s)]
*  And it's fascinating. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=902.88s)]
*  And people tune in for it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  They don't come here because they want to hear about politics or they want to hear about health [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=906.08s)]
*  or they want to hear about fucking aliens. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=909.0400000000001s)]
*  They come here because they want to hear about all of it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=911.2s)]
*  And they want to hear what you think about all of it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  So it's not really interesting when someone else does it, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=917.52s)]
*  because they're not there to see what that individual thinks about the subject matter. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=920.24s)]
*  So when I turn into Megyn Kelly, it's like or tune in. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  It's because I want. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=930.16s)]
*  Don't turn into it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=932.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=932.72s)]
*  No, fuck no, dude. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=933.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm messing with her. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=934.72s)]
*  She's a lovely person. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  And she's been nothing but lovely with me. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=938.48s)]
*  But I'm sure, as I mentioned, I'm not interested in being on her bad side. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=940.16s)]
*  However, when I tune in, it's not because I want to see her reaction or her opinion on something. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=944.72s)]
*  It's because I want to learn what is the counter argument to deporting this guy, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=951.28s)]
*  Kilmar Obrego Garcia. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=956.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, the steel man, that argument for me. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=957.84s)]
*  And then tune into something else and try to disseminate what the truth is. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=960.8s)]
*  And she's, I think, a constitutional attorney. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=964.16s)]
*  So I feel like I'm getting great information with you. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=966.64s)]
*  You're not just learning about something. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=970.56s)]
*  But you're also curious what you think about it. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=973.28s)]
*  If you're going to go, oh, bullshit. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=975.12s)]
*  Or if you're like, if you do that, wow, you know, you want to say what you think about it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=976.48s)]
*  Yeah, I just think we could all do with a little less yelling at each other. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=982.16s)]
*  You're totally right. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=986.72s)]
*  I just don't think it's good for anybody. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=987.52s)]
*  Every time I've engaged in it, I feel bad for the rest of the day. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=990.4s)]
*  Even if I win. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=994.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel good. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=994.88s)]
*  I just feel like, ugh, I don't like that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=995.84s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=998.64s)]
*  What if they deserved it? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=999.44s)]
*  I think you should be nice until it's time to not be nice. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1003.04s)]
*  And generally, that's like extreme violence. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1006.32s)]
*  That's my feeling. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1009.28s)]
*  That's my feeling. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1011.04s)]
*  You know, like, be nice up until you're literally trying to incapacitate a person. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  I feel like I don't think we have to do that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1018.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think the only time you have to do that is when someone's completely psychotic. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1021.6s)]
*  Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the time, you're better off serving [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1025.76s)]
*  you and that person. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1030.72s)]
*  Better by just being nice and calm and making a point in an intelligent fashion. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1032.56s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1036.8s)]
*  You're not being married to your ideas either. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1037.84s)]
*  Also, you know, not like taking an opposition to your ideas as an opposition to you as a being. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1040.48s)]
*  You know, these are just ideas. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1047.68s)]
*  Like if someone thinks that you're incorrect, if someone thinks I'm incorrect, I'm like, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1049.92s)]
*  well, tell me why. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1053.6s)]
*  What do you what do you think? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1054.64s)]
*  Why do you think that? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1056.0s)]
*  Where'd you come to this conclusion? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1057.28s)]
*  What was the tipping point for you? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1060.16s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1061.84s)]
*  Like, tell me what it is rare, though. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1063.1999999999998s)]
*  I was just actually talking to Mike Rowe about that. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1065.04s)]
*  Why do we hold on so fastidiously to our dogma? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1067.6799999999998s)]
*  And honestly, because it doesn't feel right to have somebody say, I told you so. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1072.32s)]
*  I will do the mea culpa and I have a million times, but it is certainly more rare. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1076.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, how often do you see a walk back or a course? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1082.08s)]
*  Correct. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  Not often. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1085.76s)]
*  And I know that when people wag their finger at me, are you happy? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1086.9599999999998s)]
*  This is what you voted for. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1090.96s)]
*  You want to defend things that arguably you may agree with them on. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1092.8s)]
*  And I'm like, don't don't don't do it. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1096.72s)]
*  Just do you do you see their point? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1099.52s)]
*  If so, acknowledge you see their point. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  And then I still feel the need to play the lesser evil game, even when they're right. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1104.0s)]
*  They're still wrong because when I weigh out, you know, the choices I had, even though you're [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1110.56s)]
*  right on this issue, you know, I'm right about my choice ultimately, because more things [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1115.44s)]
*  went the way I wanted them to than the way I didn't. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1120.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of ego strength to admit where you're wrong. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1122.88s)]
*  And I just don't think a lot of people have that. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1126.64s)]
*  And there is a tribalism with everything, whether it's workout trends, diets, for God's sake. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1128.48s)]
*  I mean, we've seen this kind of dogma in health and wellness for years. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1135.76s)]
*  That's no fun to say you were wrong. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1140.8s)]
*  And in some cases, it can have professional repercussions for people. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1142.24s)]
*  Sure. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1145.44s)]
*  Did you experience any professional repercussions when you're pushing back against this healthy [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1146.3999999999999s)]
*  at any size stuff? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1151.4399999999998s)]
*  How much time do you have on that one? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1153.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, let's go into it, because that to me was so fascinating. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1154.72s)]
*  I get comfortable. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  The concept of fat shaming, which, like, I don't think you should hurt anybody's feelings. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1159.12s)]
*  But I think at a certain point in time, sometimes hurting someone's feelings causes actions [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1163.12s)]
*  and hurting someone's feelings with the truth. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  And you can give the truth to someone lovingly. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1171.36s)]
*  You know, you could say, look, I care about you. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1173.6s)]
*  This is why I want to tell you you're a fat fuck. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1175.04s)]
*  You really are. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1177.44s)]
*  You're disgusting. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1178.3999999999999s)]
*  And you need to lose weight. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1179.52s)]
*  And you're fully addicted to food. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1180.6399999999999s)]
*  And you don't understand what it's doing to your body. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1183.36s)]
*  And you're being lied to by all these other people, like these fat doctors. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1186.08s)]
*  Like, there's some lady in the UK who calls herself the fat doctor. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1190.56s)]
*  I'm like, lady, you're just overwhelmed with inflammation. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1193.36s)]
*  I could just see it looking at you. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1197.92s)]
*  It's just crazy that you're giving this advice out. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1199.2s)]
*  When you're you can't walk up a hill. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1201.52s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1203.52s)]
*  You're so unhealthy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1204.56s)]
*  And this idea that shaming people is worse than telling them the truth. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1206.8s)]
*  It's going to make them feel bad, maybe temporarily. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1212.32s)]
*  But you could do it with kindness. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1215.12s)]
*  And then that person can make choices that will be. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1216.6399999999999s)]
*  And then you encourage them. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1219.84s)]
*  Like, I'm so glad you changed your diet. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1220.8s)]
*  I'm so glad you cut out this and cut out that. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1223.2s)]
*  And now you're doing well. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1225.6799999999998s)]
*  And you've decided to walk 10,000 steps a day. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1226.72s)]

*  Terms apply. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1270.72s)]
*  You've given me a lot to tackle here. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1271.76s)]
*  So let's start with the SIOP component of healthy in any size. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1273.28s)]
*  This is a big food narrative. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1279.4399999999998s)]
*  This has been proven. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  Even the friggin... [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1282.32s)]
*  Explain big food narrative. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1286.08s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1286.96s)]
*  So Big Food, put simply, hired a bunch of registered dietitians to co-opt this concept [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1287.44s)]
*  of intuitive eating. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1294.64s)]
*  And I'm dead ass serious with hashtags like derail the shame and they paid them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  And they put out all of these posts and went to all of these conventions and promoted the narrative [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  that you can be healthy at any size. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1313.44s)]
*  And it's just a flat out lie. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1316.32s)]
*  It is a flat earther conversation. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1318.0s)]
*  It is pseudoscience at its best. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1320.08s)]
*  There's no truth behind that. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1323.6799999999998s)]
*  There is a robust amount of data that show us being obese is associated with like 170 [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1325.4399999999998s)]
*  comorbidities. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1333.6799999999998s)]
*  This is a non factor. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1334.48s)]
*  It's been debunked. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1336.24s)]
*  We know this for a fact. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1337.4399999999998s)]
*  So when that happens, what they're doing is essentially placating someone [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1338.3999999999999s)]
*  who already feels... [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1346.16s)]
*  Now, I can attack what's going on or address rather what's going on with an individual [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  who is that size. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  And it is largely psychological. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1353.52s)]
*  Once you are past the point of dad bod, you know what I mean? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1357.04s)]
*  Like, oh, I work three jobs. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1360.8s)]
*  Life beat me down. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1363.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a food desert and I'm 40 pounds overweight and I've let myself go. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  This is a different animal. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1369.3600000000001s)]
*  When you're dealing with somebody who is a 50 plus pounds overweight, there is a [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1371.12s)]
*  psychological component. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1376.56s)]
*  So the first thing we need to do is make them aware that there is a problem without [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1377.6799999999998s)]
*  question. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1381.9199999999998s)]
*  But you can do it without shame, giving them facts of, listen, this is unhealthy. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  And because you are such a valuable individual, I want you to understand this because only [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1386.7199999999998s)]
*  from a place of feeling truly worthy, are you able to facilitate a change. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1392.8s)]
*  You don't work out because you hate your body. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1397.76s)]
*  You work out because you love it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1399.52s)]
*  So it doesn't need to be as shaming. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1401.76s)]
*  There's no shame there, to be honest, Joe. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1406.4s)]
*  I know that people claim there is because you pointed out this vulnerability or this [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1408.32s)]
*  flaw in the person. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1415.28s)]
*  But we all have flaws and vulnerabilities. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1416.4s)]
*  People who are overweight simply wear them. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1419.36s)]
*  So it's easier to judge, right? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1421.28s)]
*  So by educating them first and then without question, I like to give people, or when I [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1423.6000000000001s)]
*  was able to do the work hands on, that rock bottom moment because they are overweight [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1430.5600000000002s)]
*  because it is providing them with something extraordinarily significant. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1437.44s)]
*  And I can give you examples should you need them. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1441.2s)]
*  But I promise you that one time or another, people turn to addictions, in this case food, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1443.76s)]
*  because it means their psychological survival. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1449.76s)]
*  So put simply the most obvious example would be a person who was incested, molested, raped, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  puts on weight to desexualize. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1458.56s)]
*  That's just one example of many, but it's easy to illustrate the point. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1460.24s)]
*  So whatever this thing is providing them is the part that's so hard to let go of. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1464.48s)]
*  Because unconsciously, it's terrifying. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1469.68s)]
*  And you got to first show them this is why we need to change. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1472.08s)]
*  And then you got to give them that path towards change. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1475.92s)]
*  And you got to make it harder. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1478.32s)]
*  You got to make them feel the pain. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1479.9199999999998s)]
*  It could be physically. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1482.1599999999999s)]
*  It could be psychologically. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1482.96s)]
*  But it doesn't have to be shameful of the way they've been living so that the work and [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1484.08s)]
*  the sacrifice associated with change is less painful than continuing the negative [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1489.9199999999998s)]
*  and destructive habits. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1497.84s)]
*  You don't have to shame them. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1499.6799999999998s)]
*  I know what the message seems like it is, but it really isn't. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, the whole term fat shaming is pretty recent, right? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1505.36s)]
*  Yes, very. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's get right back to when I was just you asked me what I lost. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1509.92s)]
*  Intuitive eating is a fascinating phrase. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1513.68s)]
*  And the idea that this is by the same people that used to be in charge of tobacco. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1516.48s)]
*  This is what's really crazy. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1523.36s)]
*  These are the R.J. Reynolds and these tobacco companies bought all these fast food processed [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1524.48s)]
*  companies and they use the same tactics that they use with that to push terrible foods on people. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1530.24s)]
*  Well, they literally have a team of multidisciplinary scientists that work around the clock to figure out [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1536.72s)]
*  how to get people to not eat just one and then put it in a commercial. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1543.52s)]
*  It's like literally in broad daylight. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1548.56s)]
*  Look what we're doing to people. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1550.88s)]
*  Bet you can't eat just one. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1552.08s)]
*  Yes, one. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1553.04s)]
*  You know, but the what they're doing is they are exploiting somebody's psychology [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  and they're hijacking their biology with this food without question. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1561.04s)]
*  And this is why you have seen rates of obesity skyrocket from what 70s when it was like 5% of [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1565.04s)]
*  the adult population was overweight or obese to 74% raw is a quantum leap in genetics. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1572.56s)]
*  That's a big pharma, PSIOP of like, no, no, no, this is all genetic. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1579.92s)]
*  You're genetically obese. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1584.88s)]
*  What happened? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1588.72s)]
*  I've never seen such a quantum leap in genetics. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1589.8400000000001s)]
*  How come we were genetically obese in the 70s? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1592.0s)]
*  Like what was that tipping point, if you will, that created the cascade of obesity [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1594.64s)]
*  over the last five decades? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1600.4s)]
*  Of course, it's exactly what you're talking about. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1602.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's ingredients and food. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1604.16s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1605.52s)]
*  That and also how they engineer the environment and you're surrounded by it. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1607.2s)]
*  You can't escape it. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  Remember the days when you weren't allowed to have food at a bookstore? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1613.6s)]
*  And now every friggin bookstore has a cafe. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1617.76s)]
*  Yeah, 600 calorie drink. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1620.72s)]
*  You are surrounded. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1623.12s)]
*  There is nowhere you can go right now where food is not omnipresent in particular, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  this crappy food. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1629.52s)]
*  And they generally do it through government contracts and subsidies. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's at your schools, your hospitals, anywhere you go, you will find this garbage food. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1633.84s)]
*  So even if you have that moment of willpower, which is arguably this fleeting moment of bravado, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1640.0s)]
*  if you're constantly surrounded by it, you will give in. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1647.4399999999998s)]
*  Managing your environment is a large part of helping someone be successful. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1651.04s)]
*  It's a bandaid, right? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1656.32s)]
*  If you're dealing with sexual abuse, for example, but controlling the environment is [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1657.52s)]
*  definitely a component in helping them. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1661.4399999999998s)]
*  You can't control the environment, can't control the narrative. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1663.36s)]
*  You can't control what's in the food. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1666.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's all by design. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1668.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not just the crap in the food. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1670.56s)]
*  It's how they control the narrative around it and how they engineer the environment [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1673.12s)]
*  and how they systematically shut down the people that point it out as fat shamers, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1677.1999999999998s)]
*  for example, or racists. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1681.6799999999998s)]
*  It's another big one. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1683.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big one or transphobes or fill in the blank. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1684.32s)]
*  But it's fascinating to me that hospitals fall into this. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1687.4399999999998s)]
*  A friend of mine was visiting his friend who has prostate cancer. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1691.52s)]
*  And this guy is in the hospital being treated for cancer. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1696.3999999999999s)]
*  And then he went to look at what they're feeding him in the hospital. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1699.2s)]
*  And they were feeding him applesauce, which is loaded with high fructose corn syrup, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1702.3999999999999s)]
*  apple juice or orange juice, which is not even juice. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1706.8799999999999s)]
*  It's concentrate. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1709.76s)]
*  It's all bullshit. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1710.72s)]
*  And then some kind of a fucking sandwich, which is made out of this processed wheat bread. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1711.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably has in that meal alone, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1716.8799999999999s)]
*  a hundred plus chemicals. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1720.48s)]
*  I think I'm being conservative. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1721.84s)]
*  Yeah, at a hospital. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1723.04s)]
*  It has to do with government contracts. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1724.72s)]
*  It's so crazy that hospitals, their diets and hospitals are co-opted. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1726.72s)]
*  I can't even my kids who I know will be watching this. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1731.84s)]
*  So I love you guys. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1735.84s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  But they stopped packing their lunches. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1738.0s)]
*  And I was like, guys, why are we not packing our lunches anymore? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1741.68s)]
*  And I would watch all the crap that I would buy go bad in the pantry. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1744.4s)]
*  And my son ratted my daughter out. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1748.16s)]
*  He's like, she's eating breakfast at school. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1750.24s)]
*  And I was like, what are you talking about? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1752.56s)]
*  He's like, the sugar cereal. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1754.16s)]
*  Who's having that at school? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1755.68s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1757.68s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1759.1200000000001s)]
*  Even my kids who know better. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  But isn't that a rebellion against mom, though? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1764.0s)]
*  Which kids definitely do. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1765.92s)]
*  Like my youngest daughter, she jokes around about, she's like, oh, seed oils. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1767.04s)]
*  I love seed oils. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1771.04s)]
*  She'll have salad dressing with seed oil. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1772.8s)]
*  And she like mocks me. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1774.96s)]
*  I'm like, OK, you eat whatever you want, but just know what it is. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1775.92s)]
*  I honestly think the kids know what it is. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1781.04s)]
*  And I try to give them enough freedom now at these ages, 13 and 15, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1784.64s)]
*  to make some of their own decisions. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  So not everything is a pushback. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1791.68s)]
*  But I truly think there is an addictive component. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1793.76s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1797.28s)]
*  And she just, it's like, I'm so good at home. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1798.0s)]
*  And I don't mean to associate, I'm not good, but I eat well at home. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1800.88s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1804.4s)]
*  And just at school. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1806.8s)]
*  I'm just going to do this at school. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1808.32s)]
*  And the problem obviously is when she goes off to college, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1809.92s)]
*  I won't be able to control the environment at home. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1813.92s)]
*  And I'm like, honey. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  OK, hold on. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1816.88s)]
*  There's, forgive me, there's a 20-year-old influencer named Bad Baby, I think. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1817.92s)]
*  Joe, she saw this girl. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1825.52s)]
*  That's the lady from Dr. Phil. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1828.16s)]
*  Catch me outside. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1829.8400000000001s)]
*  Catch me outside. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1830.88s)]
*  So she saw this girl, I think she was like nine, and has followed Bad Baby. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1831.8400000000001s)]
*  Bad Baby now has cancer. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1836.24s)]
*  What? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1837.68s)]
*  I believe so. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1838.8799999999999s)]
*  For real? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1840.8s)]
*  According to my daughter. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1841.84s)]
*  Exactly the point, though. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1843.44s)]
*  That's exactly the point. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1845.12s)]
*  And so now I can say to my kids, this isn't just mom's generation, which, how come? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1846.8s)]
*  There's something else to look at. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1855.44s)]
*  My mom is 76. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1856.72s)]
*  None of the public figures in her generation got cancer. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  You didn't see Susan Sarandon or Scorned Weaver or Meryl Streep. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1862.08s)]
*  None of them got cancer. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1865.28s)]
*  But in my generation, Maria Menounos, Christina Abelgat, something's going on with Angelina Jolie, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1866.56s)]
*  Kate Middleton. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1871.6s)]
*  In my generation, the canary is dead in the coal mine. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1872.96s)]
*  It's not even a question of the negative impact. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1876.0s)]
*  If we're not looking at statistics, if we're just looking from an observational perspective, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1878.56s)]
*  it's in the news every single day. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  Someone's dealing with cancer. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1885.1200000000001s)]
*  Olivia Munn. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1886.4s)]
*  Now you're seeing 20-year-olds deal with this. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1888.08s)]
*  And I was able to point to that, to my daughter, and say, this is the shit that I am talking about. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1890.96s)]
*  She's five years older than you. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1895.12s)]
*  What does that lady have? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1897.04s)]
*  Does it say? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1899.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, she's claimed that she's got a form of leukemia, I believe. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1900.9599999999998s)]
*  But people, yeah. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1905.1999999999998s)]
*  They debate, they doubt her? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1906.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1908.1599999999999s)]
*  They doubt her. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1908.6399999999999s)]
*  She's a little bit kooky, right? [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1910.1599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1911.84s)]
*  There's still, you still can point to the fact, even if it's not bad baby, who may be lying. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1912.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1917.6799999999998s)]
*  I like how you're using that name, bad baby. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1918.32s)]
*  Is it bad baby? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1919.9199999999998s)]
*  Bad, what the? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1920.8s)]
*  I said bad bunny the other day and my kids are like, no, that's the rapper. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1921.9199999999998s)]

*  She has no regrets about her cosmetic tweaks. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1928.32s)]
*  What does a cosmetic tweak have to do with leukemia? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1930.1599999999999s)]

*  I think people are just- [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1932.9599999999998s)]
*  They're not going to perform plastic surgery on a cancer patient. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1933.76s)]
*  What? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1936.32s)]

*  She, oh, breaks silence on claims she lied about having cancer after being slammed for vaping. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1945.6799999999998s)]

*  She underwent plastic surgery and challenged rival Alabama Barker to a physical fight, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1971.68s)]
*  all while battling leukemia. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1977.0400000000002s)]
*  Apparently Alabama Barker did not show up for that fight, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1979.2s)]
*  because my daughter was very disappointed by that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  What, they were going to meet somewhere, an actual fight? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1983.44s)]
*  I think in Calabasas and throw down. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1985.52s)]
*  Oh boy, the Calabasas throw down, the classic. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1987.6000000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1991.28s)]
*  It used to be an old west shootout, now it's a Calabasas throw down. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1991.76s)]
*  Sure, there's a hair pulling and all that kind of stuff. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1995.68s)]
*  I can tell you with certainty is that the rate of early on site cancer diagnosis in people 18 to 49 [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=1998.64s)]
*  has gone up 79% over the past two decades. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2005.92s)]
*  So if in fact bad baby is being untruthful and deceitful, those statistics are real. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2009.28s)]
*  Yes, those statistics are real and including the big leap since the COVID vaccine was rolled out. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2016.48s)]
*  I don't have any information on that. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2023.44s)]
*  There was a doctor that was on the Tucker Carlson show the other day that's saying [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2025.44s)]
*  he's seeing pancreatic cancer in kids for the first time ever in his career. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2029.28s)]
*  My entire career, I never saw pancreatic cancer in children. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2034.32s)]
*  I want to play devil's advocate to that argument and simply say [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2037.92s)]
*  the statistic that I just cited I believe came out in 2019. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2041.28s)]
*  So this is pre-COVID. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2046.32s)]
*  Oh, I'm not doubting that diet and environmental factors. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2047.44s)]
*  I think there's a host of different things going on. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2050.56s)]
*  For sure, there's pesticides and herbicides. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2052.88s)]
*  That's a major factor. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2054.8s)]
*  When you look at the fact that 90 plus percent of people have roundup in their blood, that's crazy. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2056.8s)]
*  You know that stuff is linked to chemical warfare from Vietnam. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2063.6s)]
*  It has a historical connection to Agent Orange. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2066.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2070.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2070.56s)]
*  Google it. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2071.04s)]
*  Jamie, check that. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2071.6s)]
*  Yeah, because I wrote about it in a book. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  That should alarm you. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2075.12s)]
*  Glyphosate is everywhere. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2076.32s)]
*  It's so spooky. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2077.52s)]

*  And other countries won't even allow its use. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2147.2000000000003s)]
*  And we spray it on everything. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2149.52s)]
*  Not only that, we have like corns genetically engineered to be immune to glyphosate so they [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2150.88s)]
*  can just spray the shit out of it. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  And then you eat that corn and you're getting glyphosate residue. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2156.96s)]
*  You're just getting it and it's in your blood. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2160.08s)]
*  It's in everything. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2161.84s)]
*  It's in everything. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2163.76s)]
*  It's in rice. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2164.32s)]
*  It's in water. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2164.88s)]
*  It's in wheat. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2165.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2166.6400000000003s)]
*  It's in everything. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2166.96s)]
*  Well, especially. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2167.6s)]
*  It's in the runoff so it gets in the fish. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2167.92s)]
*  You know, most freshwater fish have toxic levels of lead or heavy metals in them. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  Like most freshwater fish. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2177.6s)]
*  You really probably shouldn't be eating. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2180.16s)]
*  I knew big predatory fish. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2181.92s)]
*  Yes, that's in the ocean. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2183.92s)]
*  But that's heavy metals from the ocean, which is also from us. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2185.52s)]
*  But that's mercury. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2188.64s)]
*  But there's toxic levels of heavy metals and pollutants and, you know, forever chemicals [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2190.48s)]
*  that are in freshwater fish. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2198.0s)]
*  Because all that shit that's in the ground gets into lakes. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2199.92s)]
*  All that shit that, you know, all the runoff, all that stuff gets into streams, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2203.12s)]
*  gets into creeks, gets into rivers. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2207.2s)]
*  You know, we watched a video when we had Will Harris from White Oak Pastures on the podcast. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2209.44s)]
*  And he showed the difference between his regenerative farm [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2217.6000000000004s)]
*  that doesn't use any pesticides or herbicides and his neighbor's farm. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2220.0800000000004s)]
*  And there's a literally a dividing line in the river where you can see the runoff from [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2223.36s)]
*  his neighbor's farm turns the entire river brown. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2228.96s)]
*  And it's legal. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2232.1600000000003s)]
*  It's legal to pollute. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2233.6000000000004s)]
*  Of course. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2235.36s)]
*  Because it's industrial farming. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2236.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2238.08s)]
*  But it's crazy. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2239.36s)]
*  It's just like all that industrial fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides are running off [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2240.0s)]
*  because the topsoil is dead. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2245.7599999999998s)]
*  So all that stuff is running off as soon as it rains and it runs right into the river. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2247.36s)]
*  And you could see a dividing line. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2252.24s)]
*  There's like clear water on one side and this disgusting brown dirty water on the right side. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2254.0s)]
*  Have you seen where it runs from the river into the ocean [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2261.2s)]
*  and creates dead zones that you can see from space? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2264.56s)]
*  No oxygen. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2267.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2268.8s)]
*  Nothing but jellyfish for miles. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2268.96s)]
*  Well, I have a friend of mine who was a yoga instructor and he's from Argentina. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2270.6400000000003s)]
*  And he came to America and no one told him, he was in LA, no one told him don't surf [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2275.04s)]
*  after it rains. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2282.48s)]
*  So he was surfing and he didn't understand that all the runoff from all the streets [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  goes into the ocean. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2289.76s)]
*  He got horribly sick. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2290.7200000000003s)]
*  And he was bedridden. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2292.8s)]
*  And he was like, what the fuck is going on with the ocean? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  Having grown up in California and spending a lot of time in the water, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2297.84s)]
*  I have known this for years and now I can't even imagine by the way in California who would dare [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2301.92s)]
*  to get in the ocean at this point considering all of the crap from the fires. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2307.6000000000004s)]
*  That's a great irony. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2314.48s)]
*  That's my favorite. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2315.76s)]
*  Oh, we're not doing any forestry mitigation because of the environment. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2316.8s)]
*  And yet these fires have rolled back all of those protections by something like 20 years. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  Is it just? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2327.2s)]
*  Well, that ground is ruined forever. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2327.92s)]
*  Destroyed and then pours into the ocean. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2329.3599999999997s)]
*  Twice the size of Manhattan, ruined ground. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2331.44s)]
*  All those people that had electric cars, those cars, those batteries, all that shit, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2334.64s)]
*  all the plastics and the fiberglass and carbon fiber, all that stuff, the tires, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2340.72s)]
*  all that stuff is now in the soil. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2345.68s)]
*  Good luck having a garden. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2348.7999999999997s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2350.48s)]
*  You want to try to grow plants? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2351.3599999999997s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2352.7999999999997s)]
*  I was talking to, I don't know if you've ever seen this gentleman. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2354.48s)]
*  He's really great. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2357.6000000000004s)]
*  He wrote a book called Eat to Beat Disease named Dr. William Lee and he called me after the fire [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2358.2400000000002s)]

*  Are you in California? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2368.4s)]
*  And I was like, I am at the moment. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2369.52s)]
*  In fact, I'm right here by Palisades. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2370.96s)]
*  And he said, Jill, do you remember 9-11 dust, that whole thing with all that? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2374.0s)]
*  I was like, of course I remember. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2378.6400000000003s)]
*  Send me a bunch of articles. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2380.1600000000003s)]
*  And he's like, you got to get out of there. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2381.52s)]
*  Get your mom out of there. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2382.8s)]
*  He's like, it gets in your kids' clothes when they're on their way to school. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2384.4s)]
*  He goes, we're going to be talking about this 10 years from now, the result of the toxins [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2388.2400000000002s)]
*  in this fire and how they've affected people's health. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2393.2000000000003s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2395.6000000000004s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2396.8s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2397.36s)]
*  And it happens twice a year. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2397.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2399.52s)]
*  At least. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2399.84s)]
*  Oh, I was evacuated three times when I lived in LA. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2400.32s)]
*  In fact, I lost two homes, one that I owned in 2018 and one that I sold in 21 just actually burnt. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2404.88s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2412.8s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2413.36s)]
*  And nothing's, I mean, what they did during the fire was just so insane. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2414.4s)]
*  The fact that the reservoir was empty. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2421.1200000000003s)]
*  Oh, we need to make a lid for it. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2423.2000000000003s)]
*  We didn't get around to it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2424.6400000000003s)]
*  For over a year and it hadn't even begun. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2426.1600000000003s)]
*  There was so many things wrong there that I could literally. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2429.04s)]
*  What's lack of funding, Jillian? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2431.6800000000003s)]
*  They don't have enough money. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2432.8s)]
*  Oh, I can't. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2433.52s)]
*  Have you seen Mike Schellenberger talk about this? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2435.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2437.2000000000003s)]
*  That will make your blood boil. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2437.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2439.76s)]
*  Schellenberger's great. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2440.5600000000004s)]
*  I love him. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2441.36s)]
*  He's like, we knew about this for seven days with the winds and we could have, you know, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2442.8s)]
*  we could have borrowed firefighters from all different states and this and that and had [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  the position. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2451.44s)]
*  Karen Bass went to Ghana for a birthday party. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2452.08s)]
*  Knowing, knowing between Mike Schellenberger and Corolla, ripping me into a frenzy about this. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2453.76s)]
*  I literally think I've like popped 10 blood vessels because so much of this could have [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2461.2000000000003s)]
*  been mitigated and wasn't. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2466.7200000000003s)]
*  And in fact, Gavin Newsom, my favorite Paul edition. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2468.64s)]
*  He's my favorite podcaster. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2473.2799999999997s)]
*  I wish we would get back to it. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2474.48s)]
*  He stopped. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2475.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know why he stopped. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2476.56s)]
*  Did he stop? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2477.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2477.8399999999997s)]
*  Fucking show was horrible. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2478.56s)]
*  Everybody was mocking him. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2480.96s)]
*  It was so bad for him. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2482.16s)]
*  He kept he had this idea of reaching across the aisle. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2483.2s)]
*  So he reached across the aisle and it gets guys like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2486.0s)]
*  and they eat his lunch. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2489.52s)]
*  And so and people are thinking his party like, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2490.7999999999997s)]
*  You're making us look horrible. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2495.2799999999997s)]
*  So he bails on his podcast. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2496.72s)]
*  What was his last episode? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2498.32s)]
*  Oh, he's back. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, we weren't going to get that lucky. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2502.56s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2504.8s)]
*  Oh, Rahm Emanuel. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2505.92s)]
*  Okay, that's well now he's with his own side. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2507.1200000000003s)]
*  Scott Galloway, pretty much his own side. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2509.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2511.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2512.4s)]
*  Anthony Scaramucci. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  He hates Trump. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2514.32s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2515.1200000000003s)]
*  Yep. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2515.92s)]
*  Ezra Klein. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2516.32s)]
*  Okay, that makes sense. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2517.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's not that it's gone away. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2519.52s)]
*  It's just that it's so horrible. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2521.44s)]
*  Nobody's watching it and no one is even talking about it anymore. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2522.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that might be it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2525.6800000000003s)]
*  This is Gavin Newsom. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2526.56s)]
*  God. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2528.96s)]
*  But it was so funny because that was the response after the election. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2530.0800000000004s)]
*  They said, well, podcasts influenced the election. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2534.56s)]
*  So we'll start our own podcast. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2537.28s)]
*  Your podcast is going to make people even more inclined to not vote for you. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2539.6000000000004s)]
*  My favorite was we need our own version of Joe Rogan. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2544.32s)]
*  I had love when you I remember when you you loved Bernie. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2547.44s)]
*  You were like, I like the guy. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2552.0s)]
*  You had Joe Rogan. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  Joe was on your side. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2555.84s)]
*  And that's the one thing with the left is they purge people from the party. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2558.0s)]
*  Because it's a cult. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2563.84s)]
*  It really is like leftism, not being an actual progressive. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2565.1200000000003s)]
*  Like an actual progressive is a person who's kind, who wants people to just exist and be [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2570.0s)]
*  yourself and live amongst us. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2574.96s)]
*  And we should all have social safety net and laws that like are kind and compassionate. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2577.0400000000004s)]
*  We should look at the fact that we are an incredible first world nation. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2583.0400000000004s)]
*  And we should like roll out the red carpet to all the all the people that live here and [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2586.96s)]
*  try to make it a better place for everybody. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2591.12s)]
*  That's real progressivism. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2592.96s)]
*  And then it morphed into this like let perverts get into the women's room, let men compete [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2595.04s)]
*  in women's sports, like and ignore the fact that some people are fucking psychotic and [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2600.8s)]
*  give them a blank check as long as they just say they're a woman. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2607.44s)]
*  Oh, you're a woman. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2610.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2611.28s)]
*  Carte Blanche. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2611.92s)]
*  Get in. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2612.64s)]
*  And not only that, but treat them better than you treat women themselves because they're [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2613.36s)]
*  actually more oppressed than women. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2616.72s)]
*  So that's the oppression hierarchy. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2618.3999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2621.04s)]
*  So they get the gold medal in the oppression Olympics. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2621.4399999999996s)]
*  It's like it's bananas. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2623.6s)]
*  It is bananas. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2625.4399999999996s)]
*  It really is. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2627.2s)]
*  I can't. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2628.08s)]
*  That's the stuff where you look and you say I was never for any of this. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2628.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2633.68s)]
*  If you I'm a libertarian, I'm for personal freedoms. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2633.9199999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2637.04s)]
*  If you want to change your gender as an adult, that's absolutely up for you. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2637.9199999999996s)]
*  Up to you. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2641.4399999999996s)]
*  And I would fight for your right to do that and live with dignity. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2641.9199999999996s)]
*  But when your personal choices impact the rights and the freedoms of others, this is [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2645.76s)]
*  a far more nuanced conversation. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2651.84s)]
*  Far more. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2653.84s)]
*  Especially when you're dealing with kids. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2656.5600000000004s)]
*  Oh, that's a whole different. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2659.0400000000004s)]
*  This is where it gets really crazy. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2660.0800000000004s)]
*  That's evil. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2661.6000000000004s)]
*  There's this hilarious conversation between this woman who is like she looks like she's [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2662.96s)]
*  probably in her seventies and this person's asking her if you had a granddaughter, would [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2668.6400000000003s)]
*  you support them taking puberty blockers? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2675.12s)]
*  She's like, absolutely. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2677.7599999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2679.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's insane to try to force a girl to go through puberty if she's really a boy [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2680.88s)]
*  and this and that. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2685.8399999999997s)]
*  Would you would you allow them to get a tattoo? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2686.56s)]
*  Oh, I think that's permanent. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2690.4s)]
*  No irony. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2694.3199999999997s)]
*  Seconds later, no recognition of what she's saying. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2695.7599999999998s)]
*  Like tattoos can be removed, lady. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2699.3599999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2701.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2702.24s)]
*  They can laser those off. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2702.7999999999997s)]
*  Have you noticed though? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2704.72s)]
*  They really don't understand it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2706.48s)]
*  No. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2708.3999999999996s)]
*  And I got in a conversation with Jessica Tarlov about this and she's like, oh, but, you know, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2708.72s)]
*  they the kids go through extensive therapy. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2712.64s)]
*  I'm like, that's not true, Jessica. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2714.9599999999996s)]
*  Or the concept that it's reversible. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2716.64s)]
*  People believe that's exactly. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2719.04s)]
*  Not only is it not true, but puberty blockers are the exact same thing they give to sex [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2721.2s)]
*  criminals. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2724.8799999999997s)]
*  When you have a sexual molester that is forced to be on sterilization drugs, that's exactly [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2726.08s)]
*  what they give to young boys. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2732.64s)]
*  It sterilizes kids. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2734.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2735.3599999999997s)]
*  Takes away sexual function. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2736.7999999999997s)]
*  If you interrupt puberty in the stage 10 or two. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2738.7999999999997s)]
*  And the reason I bring this up is because they'll tell you it's reversible. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2742.72s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2747.3599999999997s)]
*  So when I actually went through this exercise with somebody and I was like, show that to [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2748.16s)]
*  me. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2750.96s)]
*  And they went on chat GPT and it's like, yes, this is reversible. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2751.6s)]
*  And the argument is that should you have a child that starts puberty at seven and you [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2755.12s)]
*  use puberty blockers, it's very rare it can happen. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2760.08s)]
*  And they do it strategically to slow that down for a child and help them develop at [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2763.92s)]
*  a normal pace. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2768.2400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't sterilize them or make them incapable of having an orgasm. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2770.32s)]
*  So the distinction that's key is when you block puberty at the stage of 10 or two, which [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2773.28s)]
*  is arguably the appropriate age that puberty is meant to begin, then you've got sterilization. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2778.8s)]
*  You've got an inability to ever have an orgasm. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2785.28s)]
*  It affects bone development. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2788.08s)]
*  It affects brain development. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2789.44s)]
*  Do some strokes. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2790.7200000000003s)]
*  It's terrible for them. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2792.16s)]
*  They're friggin children. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2795.6s)]
*  Their body is not developed properly. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2797.2799999999997s)]
*  Nobody understands that. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2801.6s)]
*  They don't. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2803.6s)]
*  When they make that argument, they're told the parting line of if you make them go through [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2804.24s)]
*  this, they'll kill themselves. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2809.36s)]
*  And it turns out that the data doesn't bear out to prove that either. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2810.4s)]
*  But they have that it goes the other way. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2814.0s)]
*  The data goes the other way. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2816.0s)]
*  It goes 25% more likely to commit suicide. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2817.04s)]
*  Suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, all those things ramp up once they've transitioned [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2820.16s)]
*  because they realize they've made a horrible mistake and they've been influenced by these [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2825.68s)]
*  crazy people. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2830.0s)]
*  They want to use them as like virtue flags. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2830.96s)]
*  They want to use children as virtue flags. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2834.24s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  They also shouldn't be allowed to call them a different thing than when they call them. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2838.16s)]
*  They call them chemical castration drugs for sex offenders, but yet they call them puberty [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2843.7599999999998s)]
*  blockers. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2849.52s)]
*  And gender affirming care. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2849.92s)]
*  Gender affirming care. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2851.36s)]
*  Isn't that lovely? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2852.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking barbaric and bananas. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2853.2000000000003s)]
*  And we're going to look back at it the same way we looked at lobotomies. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2856.7200000000003s)]
*  We performed lobotomies for I think roughly around 50 or 60 years for, I think they stopped [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2859.76s)]
*  it in 1967. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2865.6s)]
*  I think that's when they stopped the last lobotomies. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2867.44s)]
*  And then they realized like, oh my God, this is a terrible thing to do. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2870.16s)]
*  But they did it for so fucking long. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2873.76s)]
*  And this is the same thing that's going to happen with this whole gender affirming care [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2876.48s)]
*  thing for minors. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2882.56s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2883.84s)]
*  Kids don't know what's going on. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2884.96s)]
*  You have children. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2886.4s)]
*  You know what it's like. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2886.96s)]
*  They go through phases and cycles. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2887.92s)]
*  They become tomboy's and boys play with dolls. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2889.76s)]
*  Like who cares? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2893.2000000000003s)]
*  By the way, a lot of those boys that want to transition, it turns out they're just gay. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2895.04s)]
*  And if you just leave them and let them be gay, and a lot of my gay friends fucking hate [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2899.52s)]
*  it because they're like, you're trying to race gay people. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2903.68s)]
*  You're trying to say that all these gay people are really in the wrong gender. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2906.24s)]
*  I've never thought of it from that angle. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2910.56s)]
*  I have seen the financial component, though. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2912.96s)]
*  Oh, that's a big problem. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2916.3199999999997s)]
*  Multi-billion dollar business. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2917.3599999999997s)]
*  That's where it's evil. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2918.72s)]
*  And when you look at who's funding this stuff, I remember my God, I used to go to the freaking [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2919.6s)]
*  human rights campaign dinners and donate. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2925.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, you're fighting for gay marriage and good liberal. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2928.48s)]
*  And now when you go to their page, if they've got a score, and forgive me, I can't remember [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2932.72s)]
*  the frigging name of it, but there's a score where they rate different medical institutions [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2939.52s)]
*  on how they provide gender affirming care. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2943.92s)]
*  And if they get a bad score, it impacts, I think, how much grant money they can get. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2946.88s)]
*  There's a page for this. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2953.12s)]
*  I believe it's through the HRC on their website. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2954.3199999999997s)]
*  And when you look at who funds it, Pfizer. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2957.2s)]
*  Oh, that's not at all surprising. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2960.7200000000003s)]
*  And I have one drug. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2963.6800000000003s)]
*  I think Lupron is almost a billion dollar a year business. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2964.5600000000004s)]
*  Awfully, but forgive me, it's been a minute since I've looked into this, but I'm in the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2968.1600000000003s)]
*  zone for sure. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2972.0s)]
*  Yeah, terrifying stuff. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2973.84s)]
*  It's just the money thing is so scary because when money gets attached to anything, all [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2975.1200000000003s)]
*  ethics and morals go out the window and they just try to make as much money from these [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2980.96s)]
*  things as is humanly possible. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2985.0400000000004s)]
*  And they've always done that. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2987.6800000000003s)]
*  They've always done that across the board with virtually everything. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2988.96s)]
*  And we're surprised when it happens with children. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2991.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2996.7200000000003s)]
*  You and I are surprised, but I think most people are not awake at all about it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=2997.76s)]
*  Most people aren't awake at all. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3003.28s)]
*  And if it doesn't affect them personally, they feel like it's important to espouse these [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  beliefs because these beliefs show that you're a good progressive. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3008.8s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3011.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like people's minds have been co-opted by, you know, I don't [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3013.28s)]
*  necessarily believe in demons and angels. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3018.32s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3023.44s)]
*  But if you were the devil, like, wouldn't money be your most valuable tool to get people [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3024.8s)]
*  to do absolutely atrocious, evil things that are going to ruin their lives? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3031.28s)]

*  It's like where the devil can convince good people to do things. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3037.44s)]
*  And then you use words like gender-affirming care. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3041.04s)]
*  You can kind of like change the narrative, but the end result is really just you're profiting [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3044.88s)]
*  off of people's confusion. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3052.08s)]

*  It's literal child sacrifice. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3056.7200000000003s)]
*  Those children that wind up committing suicide because they went through this gender-affirming [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3059.04s)]

*  and they can't have children. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3069.04s)]

*  This is like a form of child sacrifice for financial gain. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3073.2s)]
*  I mean, you're not sacrificing them to the gods or to demons. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3076.7999999999997s)]
*  You're doing it to money. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3079.52s)]
*  And it's really wild that we can't see that. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3081.2799999999997s)]
*  We can't like look at all the data and see and understand like the complex interaction [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3084.72s)]
*  of human beings and people that are around them that influence them and, you know, that [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  they get encouragement and then they get positive feedback. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3096.16s)]
*  And then they show up at school wearing lipstick and everyone's like, you're amazing. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3099.44s)]
*  You're amazing now, Bobby. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3103.2s)]
*  Now that you're Roberta. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3105.52s)]
*  Like now you're amazing. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3107.12s)]
*  You used to be some guy that got stuffed into a locker and now your girl is incredible. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3108.16s)]
*  And you're giving them this positive feedback, you know, and it's money and people are profiting [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3112.48s)]
*  off of it. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3119.68s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3120.16s)]
*  And it's so wild to watch it all play out and realize like we are so vulnerable to influence. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3121.52s)]
*  Human beings are so, I mean, this is why cults exist. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3128.0s)]
*  This is why people are willing to be religious martyrs and blow themselves up. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3131.76s)]
*  And which, by the way, like why do they do that? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3136.0s)]
*  Why do they get kids to wear suicide vests? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3140.0800000000004s)]
*  Because you can't convince a 55 year old guy to do it. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3142.48s)]
*  55 guy with a job and a family and a lot of, you know, interests and good friends. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3145.44s)]
*  Tough to get him to wear that suicide vest. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3150.88s)]
*  You know, he's like, what? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  What am I doing? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3153.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm going to a mall? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3154.1600000000003s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3155.6800000000003s)]
*  No, why am I doing that? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3157.28s)]
*  I'm going to heaven and I'm going to get 72 virgins. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3158.48s)]
*  Can you show me these virgins? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3161.36s)]
*  Like, it's a fucking what happened to them? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3163.76s)]
*  How do these poor virgins wind up in heaven just getting raped by this 55 year old guy [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3166.56s)]
*  who blew himself up? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3170.48s)]
*  Like this is fucking insane. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3171.6s)]
*  Insane. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3173.28s)]
*  I know. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3173.84s)]
*  Well, you can't get adults to believe that, but you can get children to believe that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  So we don't want to like take that same ability to influence and then just transfer it over [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3177.84s)]
*  to children. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3184.32s)]
*  I'm not quite sure why the human mind is so fragile. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3187.6s)]
*  Asked myself that so many times. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3191.6s)]
*  And this is going to sound totally off piste here, but you brought up demons and what have [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3194.48s)]
*  you. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3199.44s)]
*  And I just watched that. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3199.6s)]
*  I didn't read the book, so forgive me. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3200.7200000000003s)]
*  But I watched the documentary on the book, Chaos on Netflix. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3202.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I read the book. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3206.1600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3207.84s)]
*  Are you not completely? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3209.04s)]
*  I cannot wrap my head around how Manson got seemingly normal people [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3212.88s)]
*  to commit this kind of murder. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3220.1600000000003s)]
*  And when you listen to these women talk about it, they're like, and then I stabbed her 15 [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3223.92s)]
*  times and I felt the knife go into her hip bone and she looked at me and said, I'm dead. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3229.44s)]
*  And that like no emotion. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3236.56s)]
*  What did you do to this woman's mind? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3238.8s)]
*  And you can't say she's an outlier because he was able to convince the group of people. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3240.7200000000003s)]
*  I cannot understand this kind of. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3246.88s)]
*  Well, that's what you do. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3250.48s)]
*  What is that? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3252.1600000000003s)]
*  That's MK Ultra. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3252.88s)]
*  Is it not? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3253.92s)]
*  Is it that? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3254.96s)]
*  Do you think it's that? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3255.76s)]
*  No, 100%. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3256.96s)]
*  That's Jolly West. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3257.92s)]
*  Jolly West was the CIA operative who visited Manson in jail. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3258.8s)]
*  He's also the guy that visited Jack Ruby after he shot Kennedy. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3264.2400000000002s)]
*  And then Jack Ruby starts saying, I'm seeing demons and the Jews are on fire. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3267.36s)]
*  And, you know, Jack Ruby didn't have a history of mental illness like that, like, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3271.44s)]
*  complete psychotic breakdowns. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3275.92s)]
*  But he did after Jolly West visited him in jail. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3277.36s)]
*  Yeah, there was like there's like real documentation about those experiments. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3281.36s)]
*  One of them is Operation Midnight Climax. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3286.08s)]
*  So the CIA was operating brothels and they were operating brothels where they would have [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3288.48s)]
*  two way mirrors and they would be behind the mirrors and these prostitutes who were working [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3293.92s)]
*  for the CIA would give the Johns LSD and then they would observe them. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3298.96s)]
*  This is all document. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3304.32s)]
*  Do you know, I knew a little bit about MK Ultra, obviously, and that they were using psychedelics [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3305.68s)]
*  to influence people and try to gain mind control. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3311.04s)]
*  LSD in particular, yeah. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3313.52s)]
*  Okay, so here's my question, though. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3314.56s)]
*  This is what I find so fascinating. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3315.92s)]
*  Do you think that the LSD simply accelerated that mental vulnerability or the ability to [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3317.44s)]
*  warp someone's mind? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3324.08s)]
*  When you tell people now you're going to perform a sex change on a child, they think that's a good [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3325.68s)]
*  idea. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3334.8s)]
*  And I'll tie it back to one thing that also is seemingly unrelated, but everyone's outraged [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3335.2799999999997s)]
*  about RFK. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3340.8s)]
*  He's not a doctor. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3341.6s)]
*  Oh my God, he's trying to get to the root of autism and he's misguided about it. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3342.96s)]
*  Where was your outrage when Xavier Richera, who's not a doctor, wanted to remove all age [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3348.0s)]
*  limits for sex changes on kids, whether surgery or not, the medicalization component that we [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3354.56s)]
*  talked about. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3360.2400000000002s)]
*  That to me is a group psychosis. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3361.12s)]
*  I wonder, to get an adult to, I'm like, where's your outrage and your concern about this? [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3363.44s)]
*  Because this is batshit crazy. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3368.56s)]
*  And nobody said a word, nobody cared, it went completely under the radar. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3370.8s)]
*  And I'm just wondering if the ability to capture someone's mind in the way that they did, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3374.96s)]
*  these CIA studies, did LSD simply accelerate a vulnerability that's already pre-existing and [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3381.28s)]
*  you're watching the brainwashing of people go on over the course of decades? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3387.04s)]
*  Because if you said this to a person, arguably in Obama's first term, when he ran on gay [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3392.0s)]
*  marriage, that you were going to run sex changes on children in the year 2024, people would have [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3397.68s)]
*  lost their frigging mind. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3404.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3405.36s)]
*  So it's just a complete, it is, it must have been brainwashed though. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3406.48s)]
*  Yeah, it is brainwashing. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3411.3599999999997s)]
*  And cults, we all know that cults are real, right? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3412.3199999999997s)]
*  We all know about the Manson family, we all know about Jim Jones, we all know about cults. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3415.44s)]
*  And we know that human beings are very vulnerable to group influence. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3421.04s)]
*  Now, when you have someone that's actually being trained by people that are psychologists [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3425.68s)]
*  and that understand influence and then also trained in using the implantation of LSD [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3431.04s)]
*  on these people, one of the things that Manson would do is he would pretend to take LSD and then [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3438.72s)]
*  he would give it to them and then influence them while they were under the influence and he was [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3444.08s)]
*  sober. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3448.08s)]
*  And this is, this was all learned through the Harvard LSD studies, which by the way, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3448.56s)]
*  created the Unabomber. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3453.36s)]
*  Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD studies. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3454.72s)]
*  Oh my God, how do I not know this? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3457.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I know he was a genius. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3460.16s)]
*  Well, he had, there was a bunch of things wrong with him. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3462.8799999999997s)]
*  First of all, when he was a baby, he was severely ill and they put him in some sort of an infirmary [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3465.12s)]
*  and he didn't have any human touch for months, for months. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3471.9199999999996s)]
*  They just, they like when he cried and he's in his crib, they left him there. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3476.72s)]
*  His brother talked about it. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3480.8799999999997s)]
*  There's a documentary on Netflix about him and his brother talked about like even before [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3482.72s)]
*  the Harvard LSD studies, he, they would, you know, he was like really fucked up, [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3487.76s)]
*  really fucked up, complete lack of empathy, like, and just sociopath. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, complete sociopath as a young man. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3496.96s)]
*  And it would express itself when he would experience rejection from women. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3500.0800000000004s)]
*  He would have like violent reactions to that rejection and write them horrific letters [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3504.6400000000003s)]
*  and torture them and yell at them. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3509.76s)]
*  Oh Jesus, it's so scary. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3511.84s)]
*  And then, then he goes through the Harvard LSD studies, which a part of his particular [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3513.68s)]
*  studies was humiliation. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3518.88s)]
*  So he would be under the influence and they would humiliate him and they would abuse him [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3520.64s)]
*  and try to get him to a certain state of mind. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3525.2799999999997s)]
*  So then this guy goes off to Berkeley, becomes a, becomes a professor and his whole idea [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3528.56s)]
*  is to just make enough money so that he can implement this program. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3534.88s)]
*  Here's what's crazy about his ideas. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3538.56s)]
*  He's kind of right. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3541.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3542.8s)]
*  So he's kind of right and he thinks that technology is going to replace human beings. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3543.6000000000004s)]
*  Like he sees this through all of his acid trips that human beings are going to be, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3548.7200000000003s)]
*  and we probably are. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3555.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3556.4s)]
*  We probably are going to be replaced by AI. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3556.7200000000003s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3558.8s)]
*  We probably are going to be replaced by synthetic life that we create and we're [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3558.88s)]
*  facilitating that with our reliance on technology. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3564.1600000000003s)]
*  So he decides he's going to live off the grid in a cabin and kill all the people that are [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3567.6800000000003s)]
*  involved in technology. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3571.68s)]
*  A very twisted, distorted reaction to this thing that we're recognizing as being real [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3572.96s)]
*  in 2025 that we are experiencing. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3580.72s)]
*  We have AI on our phones now. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3583.68s)]
*  We're constantly being monitored. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3586.3999999999996s)]
*  We're constantly being surveilled. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3588.16s)]
*  Your rights are getting very murky because all of your data is being given away. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3589.6s)]
*  Everybody knows everything about you. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3593.8399999999997s)]
*  It's easy to influence people with algorithms and also with bots and it's being used for [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3595.52s)]
*  political discourse. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3600.16s)]
*  It's being used for so many different things. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3601.2s)]
*  Essentially, we don't want to think that cults can be half the country, but for sure it can [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3603.12s)]
*  be half the country. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3610.24s)]
*  It can be the whole country. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3610.96s)]
*  If you live under Sharia law, it's the whole country. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3612.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3614.7999999999997s)]
*  The whole country believes that women have to cover every part of their body except their [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3615.2799999999997s)]
*  eyeballs. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3618.7999999999997s)]
*  This kind of thinking, we're very vulnerable to groupthink and especially groupthink that's [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3622.16s)]
*  being intentionally manipulated also and then being done with psychedelic drugs. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3627.68s)]
*  Now, they did it during the Manson era because they were trying to stop the anti-war movement. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3633.2799999999997s)]
*  They were trying to, like the hippies and all these people that were like, hey, make [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3638.16s)]
*  love, not war. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3641.44s)]
*  We have to change the association that the general public has with these people because [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3643.2s)]
*  too many people are joining up with them. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3646.7999999999997s)]
*  What they did was they got the Manson family and they got them to commit these horrific [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3650.3999999999996s)]
*  crimes. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3654.7999999999997s)]
*  Every time Charles Manson would get arrested, he would get let out of jail. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3655.28s)]
*  He was violating parole left and right and the cops that arrested him were all being [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3658.7200000000003s)]
*  told when they were interviewed, they would say, this is above my pay grade. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3663.2000000000003s)]
*  They're telling me that I have to let him go. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3668.32s)]
*  They would be contacted by someone from the State Department or wherever and saying, let [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3671.36s)]
*  them go. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3675.84s)]
*  I saw that somewhat alluded to in the documentary of like, well, when the one guy, I'm going [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3676.5600000000004s)]
*  to botch this. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3682.16s)]
*  Never mind. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3682.72s)]
*  Bottom line is they generally alluded to that, but because they didn't read the book, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3683.2s)]
*  there wasn't that kind of in-depth takeaway at all. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3688.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, the documentaries only look like 90 minutes. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3690.24s)]
*  It's very short. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3693.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3694.16s)]
*  The book is- [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3694.48s)]
*  Draws a connection, but it doesn't prove out its points. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3695.12s)]
*  I couldn't quite understand. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like, well, where's the proof of it until you just explained it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3700.08s)]
*  Tom O'Neill, the guy who wrote that book, he's been on the podcast before. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3702.96s)]
*  He was my friend Greg Fitzsimmons' neighbor in New York. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3708.08s)]
*  He was writing this 20 plus years. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3712.56s)]
*  Greg was his friend when it was happening. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3716.96s)]
*  What he was doing is he was writing an article. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3721.04s)]
*  I think it was for Vanity Fair or Variety. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3724.16s)]
*  I forget, but the article was on the anniversary of the Manson killings. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3727.92s)]
*  It was supposed to be just like, hey, this is the anniversary. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3734.24s)]
*  Just write an article about the facts. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3738.16s)]
*  He starts going into the facts of the case and he's like, wait a minute. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3740.56s)]
*  He starts investigating and he can't investigate enough. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3744.88s)]
*  Then he gets in trouble because the deadline's passed. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3748.0s)]
*  Then he gets a book deal and the deadline passes on that. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3750.96s)]
*  He's just completely obsessed with getting to the bottom of this [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3753.52s)]
*  and absorbing more and more information and documenting it all. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3756.8s)]
*  He's got enough for many books. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3759.92s)]
*  I think I believe he's writing another book right now. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3762.56s)]
*  That is absolutely insane. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3764.96s)]
*  You know that the huge irony is that these drugs, as we both know, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3767.8399999999997s)]
*  these drugs can save lives. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3772.96s)]
*  I was just talking to Callie and Brigham, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3775.2s)]
*  who are involved in the Texas Ibogaine Initiative. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3778.7999999999997s)]
*  What's so fascinating is- [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3781.8399999999997s)]
*  Very different drug. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3782.96s)]
*  Okay, but what about psilocybin? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3784.3199999999997s)]
*  Like when I talk to- [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3786.56s)]
*  Also very different drug. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3787.3599999999997s)]
*  Is it really? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3788.7999999999997s)]
*  Very, very different drug. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3790.0s)]
*  Yeah, LSD is very different than all those. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3790.96s)]
*  They didn't use psilocybin or Ibogaine or any of that stuff? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3792.7999999999997s)]
*  I thought they did. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3795.3599999999997s)]
*  Not with that, but perhaps you could if you did it correctly, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3796.24s)]
*  if you knew how to manipulate people. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3800.3199999999997s)]
*  Jolly West was well-versed in manipulation. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3802.0s)]
*  I mean, this was the whole part of the CIA's program. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3806.24s)]
*  By the way, it's not just the CIA. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3810.8799999999997s)]
*  It's other intelligence agencies. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3812.3999999999996s)]
*  MI5 was doing it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3814.08s)]
*  The UK studies on psychedelics, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3816.7999999999997s)]
*  you could see the videos of British troops on acid. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3819.8399999999997s)]
*  They dosed up these British troops from- [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3825.12s)]
*  I want to say it's the 1950s. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3827.6s)]
*  Do you know that video, Jamie? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3829.36s)]
*  You know the video. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3830.48s)]
*  We've played it before. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3831.04s)]
*  But these guys are with full fatigues, just laughing, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3832.16s)]
*  leaning up against trees, laughing. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3836.48s)]
*  They gave them malice deed. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3838.56s)]
*  To what end? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3840.48s)]
*  Both of them want to find out what it does. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3841.44s)]
*  They thought it was a truth serum. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3843.2s)]
*  Turns out it's not. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3844.48s)]
*  Like, well, what can it do? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3845.52s)]
*  And then so they used people to try to figure out [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3847.28s)]
*  what can be done with it. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3849.92s)]
*  So this is 25 minutes- [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3851.68s)]
*  Let's put your headphones on real quick. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3854.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3855.44s)]
*  The first effects of the drug became apparent. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3856.0s)]
*  25 minutes later. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3858.32s)]
*  The effects of the drug became apparent. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3858.88s)]
*  The men began to relax and to giggle. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3861.12s)]
*  But this man was more seriously affected [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3863.84s)]
*  and had to be removed from the exercise. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3866.64s)]
*  After 35 minutes, one of the radio operators [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3869.36s)]
*  had become incapable of using his set. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3872.48s)]
*  And the efficiency of the rocket launcher team [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3875.6s)]
*  was also very impaired. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3877.92s)]
*  10 minutes later, the attacking section [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3881.12s)]
*  had lost all sense of urgency. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3883.28s)]
*  Notice the bunching and indecision [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3885.28s)]
*  as they enter a wood occupied by the enemy. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3887.68s)]
*  Almost immediately, the section commander [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3890.88s)]
*  tried to use a map to find the location [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3893.2s)]
*  of troop headquarters. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3895.2s)]
*  And a prisoner's escort had to have the way [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3896.4s)]
*  pointed out to him, although it was in plain sight, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3898.8s)]
*  700 yards away over open country. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3901.68s)]
*  50 minutes after taking the drug, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3905.28s)]
*  radio communication had become difficult, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3907.28s)]
*  if not impossible. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3909.6s)]
*  But the men are still capable of sustained physical effort. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3910.96s)]
*  This man nearly succeeded in felling this tree [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3914.56s)]
*  using only a spade. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3917.92s)]
*  However, constructive action was still attempted [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3920.48s)]
*  by those retaining a sense of responsibility [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3922.88s)]
*  in spite of physical symptoms. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3925.36s)]
*  But one hour and 10 minutes after taking the drug, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3927.76s)]
*  with one man climbing a tree to feed the birds, [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3931.04s)]
*  the troop commander gave up, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3934.08s)]
*  admitting that he could no longer [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3936.2400000000002s)]
*  control himself or his men. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3937.68s)]
*  Yeah, so this is one of the first experiments [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3940.96s)]
*  they did with LSD and soldiers. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3945.6s)]
*  Would you be trying to spray the air [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3949.04s)]
*  over the opposition? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3951.12s)]
*  I mean, otherwise, what? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3953.04s)]
*  Well, you can infect their food supply, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3954.32s)]
*  you can infect their water supply. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3957.76s)]
*  So using it against your enemy, so to speak. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3959.28s)]
*  You could do that. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3962.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3964.4s)]
*  I mean, there was also some experiments [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3965.68s)]
*  that they ran. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3967.28s)]
*  I think it was in St. Louis, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3968.64s)]
*  where they were using a fan, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3971.68s)]
*  and they were spraying things, aerosol spraying, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3973.92s)]
*  to see what kind of effect things would have on people. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3978.4s)]
*  Our government, if you give them the license, right? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3981.6s)]
*  I don't want to say our government. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3986.08s)]
*  Let's just stop saying that. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3987.36s)]
*  Let's just say human beings with unchecked power. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3988.64s)]
*  Human beings with unchecked power, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3991.84s)]
*  they have an imperative. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3994.4s)]
*  Like, what are they trying to do? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3995.36s)]
*  Well, they're trying to figure out what this stuff does, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3996.8s)]
*  and what's the best way to do it. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=3999.1200000000003s)]
*  You tried it out on soldiers. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4000.32s)]
*  Like, they've always done that with vaccines [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4001.92s)]
*  and a bunch of different experimental androgens. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4003.92s)]
*  They've dosed them up with steroids [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4007.6000000000004s)]
*  and all sorts of different things to increase aggression. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4009.36s)]
*  Methamphetamine was used during the war [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4012.32s)]
*  to get kamikazes to fly their planes into boats. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4014.8s)]
*  The Nazis did it. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4017.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4019.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4020.0800000000004s)]
*  I've seen that footage of him. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4020.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it was at the Olympics. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4022.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes, 1936 Olympics. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4023.28s)]
*  Just fucking rocking. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4025.28s)]
*  Just rocking. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4027.84s)]
*  I've heard that it did not happen. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4029.6800000000003s)]
*  They propped him up on that to the degree [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4031.52s)]
*  that he was able to subsequently convince Mussolini [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4034.6400000000003s)]
*  to jump into the mix. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4037.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4038.2400000000002s)]
*  Have you ever read Blitzed? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4040.32s)]
*  No. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  Do we have it here still, Jamie? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4043.36s)]
*  Norman Oehler wrote this insane book [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4047.2000000000003s)]
*  on the ubiquitous use of drugs during the Third Reich [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4049.52s)]
*  and how it caused them to go through Poland in three days [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4052.88s)]
*  because they stayed up for three fucking days on meth. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4056.4s)]
*  And they gave the most meth to the people [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4059.6000000000004s)]
*  that were driving the tanks because they were at the front. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4061.2000000000003s)]
*  So it was like they gave different doses [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4063.84s)]
*  depending on what your job was. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4066.0s)]
*  And they just methed up, ran through Poland, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4068.1600000000003s)]
*  and they caught these people just like in France. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4071.84s)]
*  Their soldiers were given wine. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4076.5600000000004s)]
*  So these people were like drunk. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4079.2000000000003s)]
*  And then the Nazis came through, methed up, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4080.96s)]
*  and just fucking killed everybody. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4083.2s)]
*  You know, I've heard that. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4085.2s)]
*  I don't know if this is true or not. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4086.16s)]
*  So I heard that similar things were given. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4087.76s)]
*  Forgive me for throwing this out there. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4091.44s)]
*  It could be total bullshit. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4092.56s)]
*  But to Hamas on the October 7th attack [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4093.44s)]
*  in order to be able to commit those kinds of atrocities. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4096.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4100.4s)]
*  I don't know either. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4101.44s)]
*  I've heard it through friends who are Israeli. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4102.16s)]
*  It could be bullshit. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4105.12s)]
*  But I would wonder if you have to commit those kinds of violent acts [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4106.32s)]
*  against another human being. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4112.48s)]
*  I would imagine you'd have to be altered in some capacity. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4115.599999999999s)]
*  I can't even fathom being able to. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4119.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4122.16s)]
*  I can't. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4122.88s)]
*  I can't wrap my head around it. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4123.599999999999s)]
*  Well, I think human beings are capable of great atrocities [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4124.16s)]
*  without any kind of drugs. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4126.5599999999995s)]
*  One-on-one like that though? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4128.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4130.24s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4130.88s)]
*  Yeah, they do it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4131.36s)]
*  I mean, look at Vietnam. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4132.08s)]
*  Look at the things that people did during Vietnam. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4133.76s)]
*  I don't think they dosed them up in Vietnam. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4136.16s)]
*  No, I guess you're right. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4137.92s)]
*  And in Vietnam, people were taking heroin and smoking weed, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4138.88s)]
*  and they were still doing that. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4142.400000000001s)]
*  People have an evil capacity to other people and decide. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4144.64s)]
*  You see it politically in this country. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4149.68s)]
*  People on the left will demonize people on the right. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4152.72s)]
*  People on the right will demonize people on the left. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4155.68s)]
*  It's just like it's a tribal thing that it's an echo of our past [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4157.84s)]
*  because essentially when we were small tribes of 150 people [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4166.320000000001s)]
*  and then you got invaded by a neighboring tribe, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4171.12s)]
*  you had to be able to commit extreme violence against the other. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4173.76s)]
*  And you had to be able to think of them as not you. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4177.280000000001s)]
*  That's not a person. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4180.400000000001s)]
*  That's them. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4181.92s)]
*  And you have to be able to go after them. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4183.52s)]
*  I can understand that broadly. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4185.84s)]
*  And that's encouraged by the group. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4187.36s)]
*  Okay, right, fair. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4188.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4189.6s)]
*  But some of it is just so visceral and hideous, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4190.16s)]
*  and I don't mean to bring the vibe down, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4195.04s)]
*  but it's one thing to kill another human being that I have to. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4197.44s)]
*  This is how we survive or whatever it is. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4202.08s)]
*  We're fighting Nazis and you don't have a choice. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4203.92s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4205.84s)]
*  But to be heads, just that kind of stuff, I just think. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4207.2s)]
*  Torture. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4212.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4213.44s)]
*  There's no... [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4214.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4215.32s)]
*  I often ask, this is going to a very unplanned place, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4215.82s)]
*  but I ask myself what I'm capable of if somebody hurt my kids [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4219.62s)]
*  or hurt my wife or hurt my mom. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4224.179999999999s)]
*  What would I be capable of doing? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4226.0199999999995s)]
*  I bet you'd be capable of extreme violence. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4227.78s)]
*  I think, oh, without question. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4229.7s)]
*  Because you're a human being. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4231.219999999999s)]
*  But I would be capable of it, but I don't like blood. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4232.179999999999s)]
*  I can't stand blood. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4236.5s)]
*  I don't like guts. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4237.219999999999s)]
*  It would make me sick. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4238.179999999999s)]
*  It would horrify me. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4238.9s)]
*  So I'm like, how would I... [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4239.62s)]
*  This is the shit that tortures me in the middle of the night [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4240.98s)]
*  when I can't sleep. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4243.06s)]
*  How far removed am I from this mentality? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4244.580000000001s)]
*  Am I just a few catastrophes away from losing my mind [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4247.3s)]
*  and becoming a lunatic? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4250.42s)]
*  Well, that's the appeal of the walking dead. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4252.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4254.34s)]
*  The walking dead, the zombies become inconsequential. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4254.820000000001s)]
*  The real problem is people. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4258.42s)]
*  Yes, that's so true. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4259.9400000000005s)]
*  And I could do a hell of a lot of horrendous things, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4262.1s)]
*  but I couldn't... [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4265.3s)]
*  Some of the torture methods, I don't know. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4266.660000000001s)]
*  How do you have the stomach for it? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4269.9400000000005s)]
*  Look at what they did during the Inquisition. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4271.54s)]
*  You can't say that that was drugs. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4273.3s)]
*  These were people that just decided [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4276.18s)]
*  they were going to torture people. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4278.1s)]
*  And they had... [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4279.9400000000005s)]
*  They othered people. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4284.34s)]
*  This is a really evil aspect of human nature. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4286.9800000000005s)]
*  How do you defend against it, do you think? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4290.5s)]
*  Seriously, if we all have it in us, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4293.46s)]
*  what is the antidote to that? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4296.26s)]
*  You have to have a strong army. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4298.18s)]
*  You have to have people that can defend you [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4300.9800000000005s)]
*  against people that want to do that to people here. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4303.3s)]
*  And then they have to have a strong ethical [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4307.22s)]
*  and moral foundation where they would never... [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4308.9800000000005s)]
*  Be compromised? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4310.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they have to be the good guys. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4312.02s)]
*  They have to think that they're the good guys [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4313.22s)]
*  and have a very strong ethical and moral foundation [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4314.580000000001s)]
*  that doesn't allow them to compromise that. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4318.02s)]
*  It's tough, though, because when people fight dirty, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4320.42s)]
*  it's such a massive disadvantage [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4322.820000000001s)]
*  that then you think, well, I'm going to lose [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4325.860000000001s)]
*  if I don't make this sacrifice in how I'm behaving [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4327.78s)]
*  or how I'm tackling this. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4330.259999999999s)]
*  Well, we like to think that we're the good guys, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4331.62s)]
*  but the biggest thing that's ever been done [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4333.3s)]
*  to human beings that's horrific is the nuclear bomb. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4337.38s)]
*  Like indiscriminate killing of civilians, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4340.74s)]
*  hundreds of thousands, boom, in one shot. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4344.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, the argument being that you drop it [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4347.46s)]
*  and then the war ends. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4349.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4350.82s)]
*  So it's the lesser of evils. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4351.3s)]
*  You know, you've sacrificed... [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4354.5s)]
*  I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of people [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4356.9800000000005s)]
*  in that moment, but did you save millions down the road? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4358.9800000000005s)]
*  Can you justify the behavior utilizing that logic? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4361.9400000000005s)]
*  I committed this atrocity, but I saved more lives. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4366.740000000001s)]
*  That's the slippery slope that I think about often is [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4369.06s)]
*  you were just talking about this the other day when... [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4373.06s)]
*  Be careful you don't become a monster [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4375.54s)]
*  when you're fighting monsters. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4377.700000000001s)]
*  And sometimes it's that fire fighting fire conversation. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4379.54s)]
*  You want to use water, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4383.860000000001s)]
*  but what if it doesn't work? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4385.3s)]
*  Sometimes you have to become a monster. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4387.22s)]
*  Sometimes you honestly, Joe, I hate to say it, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4388.66s)]
*  but sometimes you have to. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4390.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to defeat evil, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4393.14s)]
*  you have to become a monster because if you don't, [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4394.820000000001s)]
*  you won't beat it. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4397.06s)]
*  You have to do horrific things to beat horrific people. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4398.1s)]
*  You have to kill them, right? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4401.62s)]
*  Like if someone's invading and they're shooting guns at people [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4403.22s)]
*  and they show up at the beach and they pull up in boats [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4406.18s)]
*  and they start gunning people down, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4408.820000000001s)]
*  you have to do the same to stop that. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4410.18s)]
*  This does... [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4412.58s)]
*  You can't like bring out daisies and go, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4413.22s)]
*  hey guys, like I bake you these pot brownies. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4415.14s)]
*  Just like, let's just chill. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4418.26s)]
*  And try. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4420.1s)]
*  Let's just rethink this, man. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4420.740000000001s)]
*  Sebastian Younger said this to me once. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4423.46s)]
*  He's like, listen, if you aren't willing to talk [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4425.14s)]
*  to the worst enemy, you have to fight them. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4427.860000000001s)]
*  But it's when the talking doesn't work. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4429.860000000001s)]
*  And you see that all the time. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4432.58s)]
*  I see it in my own personal life, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4434.820000000001s)]
*  when all of my best intentions and my calmest demeanor [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4437.06s)]
*  and my most empathetic approach to something fails [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4441.22s)]
*  because you're just not dealing with somebody [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4445.46s)]
*  who is rational or well-intentioned. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4448.02s)]
*  And if you broaden that out... [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4449.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, then imagine a language barrier. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4452.5s)]
*  We have no idea what they're saying. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4454.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4455.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4456.26s)]
*  And then a cultural barrier where their culture believes [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4457.38s)]
*  that if they die, that they're going to go to heaven [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4460.42s)]
*  and that there'd be a martyr. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4462.900000000001s)]
*  And so they're willing to do that. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4464.18s)]
*  They're excited to die and to kill you with them [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4466.26s)]
*  because they believe that the real prize is not in this life. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4470.34s)]
*  It's in the next life. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4476.0199999999995s)]
*  It's insane that we could... [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4476.82s)]
*  But we're very vulnerable. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4477.86s)]
*  We're very vulnerable to this kind of thinking. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4479.7s)]
*  And I don't know why we're designed this way. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4481.94s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4484.66s)]
*  It's a distortion probably of tribal survival primate instincts. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4486.5s)]
*  You see it with... [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4492.82s)]
*  Have you ever watched Chimp Nation? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4493.54s)]
*  No, I was actually going to say animals don't have it, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4495.38s)]
*  but then here we are. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4497.62s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4498.42s)]
*  Really? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4499.38s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4499.860000000001s)]
*  I know lions will kill them. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4500.5s)]
*  They're territorial. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4501.700000000001s)]
*  But the capacity for torture, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4503.06s)]
*  I've never seen that in the animal kingdom. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4506.660000000001s)]
*  That kind of... [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4508.58s)]
*  You ever see a cat with a mouse? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4509.14s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, I guess I have. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4511.22s)]
*  Yeah, they torture mice. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4513.38s)]
*  They hold on to them and then they let them go. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4514.42s)]
*  And the mouse like, oh, Jesus, you're going to let me go. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4516.660000000001s)]
*  Like, not today, motherfucker. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4518.58s)]
*  And then they torture them and want to keep playing with them. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4520.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they have zero empathy. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4523.14s)]
*  Cats are the worst. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4524.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4526.740000000001s)]
*  They have zero empathy, especially house cats, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4527.46s)]
*  because they're well fed. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4530.26s)]
*  So they're not doing it for food. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4531.38s)]
*  They're just doing it because they have instincts to kill. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4532.9800000000005s)]
*  These instincts are being distorted, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4536.66s)]
*  because the real instinct that they have to kill [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4541.7s)]
*  is so that they could survive. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4544.5s)]
*  But when they're fully fed, they don't turn those instincts off. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4546.1s)]
*  Now they just have this kill drive that's never satiated. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4550.26s)]
*  And cats are the perfect killer. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4553.3s)]
*  They move so fast. They're so stealthy. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4557.46s)]
*  They have it from the time they're kittens. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4559.78s)]
*  You see them crawl up to each other, like very slowly, very... [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4561.38s)]
*  They jump on each other. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4564.74s)]
*  I'm thinking about our cat, actually, as you're talking. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4565.86s)]
*  When we lived in Miami, he would use the dog door [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4568.9s)]
*  and he would bring in iguanas. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4572.1s)]
*  Wow, yeah. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4573.7s)]
*  This big. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4574.34s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't it crazy? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4575.14s)]
*  My wife would be like, honey! [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4578.5s)]
*  You know, chasing this fucking iguana around the house. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4580.18s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4584.1s)]
*  Yeah, and he wouldn't kill it. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4585.06s)]
*  No, they're not trying to kill it. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4586.98s)]
*  They're having fun. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4588.1s)]
*  He was having fun. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4588.9s)]
*  You have a little murderer that you live with. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4590.34s)]
*  Yeah. Cute little bastard. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4592.0199999999995s)]
*  But yes. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4594.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what cats are. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4594.5s)]
*  And that's a part of their essence. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4596.18s)]
*  I mean, they are the cleanup crew. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4598.42s)]
*  They're there to make sure the populations don't get out of control. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4600.26s)]
*  God, you bring up such a great point. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4603.62s)]
*  Have you ever seen the numbers on cats, like domestic cats, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4604.9s)]
*  what they kill every year? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4607.7s)]
*  The birds, I know they kill a crazy amount of... [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4608.98s)]
*  Billions. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4611.46s)]
*  Billions? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4612.58s)]
*  Billions. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4613.22s)]
*  Billions of birds. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4614.18s)]
*  He's an indoor cat now? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4615.62s)]
*  I don't everybody know this. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4616.74s)]
*  Let's look at the numbers. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4618.5s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4619.46s)]
*  Because people... [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4619.86s)]
*  We brought it up before, but it's worth repeating because it's kind of crazy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4621.06s)]
*  So it sort of illustrates this point. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4625.38s)]
*  So this is like... [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4627.22s)]
*  Billions? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4628.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4629.54s)]
*  B. With B. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4630.26s)]
*  Like multiple... [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4631.38s)]
*  I didn't know that was that mean. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4631.86s)]
*  House cats. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4632.9s)]
*  Oh, it does. They don't have to be. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4634.0199999999995s)]
*  They kill hundreds. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4635.14s)]
*  Each cat. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4636.18s)]
*  Feral cats are ruthless. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4636.98s)]
*  House cats, feral cats, wild cats, any cat that's outside. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4639.7s)]
*  Yeah, they instantly kill. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4642.98s)]
*  Okay, here it is. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4645.54s)]
*  Domestic cats, the leading cause of bird deaths in the United States, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4646.66s)]
*  estimated to kill 1.3 and 4 billion birds annually. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4649.46s)]
*  This includes both pet cats and cats that roam outdoors and feral cats. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4654.26s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4658.58s)]
*  American Bird Conservancy estimates that free-ranging cats kill approximately 2.4 million. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4659.54s)]
*  It's hard to know what the real numbers are. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4664.5s)]
*  Of course, right. Yeah. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4666.5s)]
*  But they know it's in the billions. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4667.22s)]
*  It's in the billions. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4668.82s)]
*  But imagine how many birds there would be if cats didn't do that. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4670.18s)]
*  Like who's going to kill them? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4673.46s)]
*  The sky would be filled with birds. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4675.86s)]
*  You go outside, you just get shit on everywhere. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4677.299999999999s)]
*  I think Alfred Hitchcock movie. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4679.0599999999995s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4680.42s)]
*  I mean, when you do look back at the plague, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4681.139999999999s)]
*  and they started killing all the cats because they were associated with witches, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4683.78s)]
*  and that's when the plague was able to kind of run more rampant [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4687.46s)]
*  because the cats were keeping that rat population down and the fleas on the rats caused... [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4690.42s)]
*  Well, that's the coyote problem in California, right? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4695.299999999999s)]
*  Like people like, oh, I hate coyotes. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4698.259999999999s)]
*  Right. But do you hate coyotes more than you hate rats? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4700.099999999999s)]
*  Because coyotes are the reason why rats aren't everywhere. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4703.14s)]
*  You know, like where I used to live, like there was a lot of coyotes, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4706.34s)]
*  but I don't see very many rats. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4710.5s)]
*  And that's the reason why like the wolves, the little wolves, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4714.1s)]
*  which is what a coyote is, the small wolf, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4718.18s)]
*  they're rat killers and rabbit killers and everything else they get a hold of. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4720.740000000001s)]
*  It's obvious that they're playing a role in this control. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4726.18s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4731.38s)]
*  Because everyone in California just thinks they ate my Pomeranian. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4733.379999999999s)]
*  Oh, they probably did. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4736.66s)]
*  And they probably did. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4738.9s)]
*  I mean, as a child... [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4739.78s)]
*  They ate my daughter's puppy. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4740.5s)]
*  But a mountain lion ate one of my dogs when I lived in Colorado. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4743.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, there's cats are motherfuckers, you know? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4747.219999999999s)]
*  And predators, like at least predators are doing it for food. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4751.139999999999s)]
*  Well, let's say you don't hold it against, as a child, I lost a dog to a coyote. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4755.459999999999s)]
*  To this day, I don't hate coyotes. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4758.98s)]
*  It's like, well, the dog was in the yard and we didn't coyote proof the yard enough. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4762.1s)]
*  Let's fucking coyote proof the yard now. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4765.38s)]
*  Really coyote proof your yard either. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4767.780000000001s)]
*  I had a coyote kill a chicken in my yard. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4770.02s)]
*  We had a six foot tall, six foot tall, wrought iron fence. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4771.780000000001s)]
*  With the rollers on it. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4774.820000000001s)]
*  Did you have those? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4775.860000000001s)]
*  No, we didn't have the rollers. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4776.34s)]
*  But the coyote with the chicken in its mouth leaped to the top like a ballerina. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4777.22s)]
*  Like it was so elegant the way I was really impressed with its athleticism. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4782.42s)]
*  And as a person who like admires physical feats, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4787.780000000001s)]
*  I was like, well, that's very impressive because we got chicken in its mouth leaped up to the [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4791.46s)]
*  top of the fence, got its paws on it, went over just so gracefully and so adept. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4796.1s)]
*  It was really impressive. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4802.5s)]
*  Okay, fair. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4803.9400000000005s)]
*  This is like, I guess animals do have a propensity for cats in particular. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4804.900000000001s)]
*  I did not think of it that way. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4809.62s)]
*  That makes me feel a little better. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4811.22s)]
*  Because the cat thing is fucked up because they're not even doing it for food. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4812.34s)]
*  But it's like that thing inside of them has been, it's there. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4815.62s)]
*  You can't satisfy it with just food. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4820.26s)]
*  I mean, they literally are the clean up crew for nature. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4822.820000000001s)]
*  That's what they are in Africa. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4827.06s)]
*  When you see them, they're looking for the wounded antelopes. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4828.74s)]
*  They're looking for anybody who's old. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4831.46s)]
*  They're looking for anybody who just can't run fast enough. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4832.820000000001s)]
*  And that's what they do. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4835.46s)]
*  And that's how they keep the populations down. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4836.18s)]
*  This is the reason why they've reintroduced wolves into Colorado. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4839.14s)]
*  And that's the reason why they reintroduced wolves in Montana. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4842.5s)]
*  And the elk populations decreased significantly. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4845.860000000001s)]
*  Because the elk populations were out of control. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4848.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4850.18s)]
*  So they brought in wolves and the wolves like radically dropped the population down. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4850.74s)]
*  And they even do surplus killing where they'll kill a bunch of things where they can't eat. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4855.46s)]
*  But just that they can't help themselves. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4859.46s)]
*  They have the opportunity to kill. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4861.46s)]
*  And so they do. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4862.9800000000005s)]
*  So what is the antidote to this within the human population? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4865.46s)]
*  Because I see the necessity for survival. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4871.14s)]
*  But it can make you quite depressed if you let it. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4874.02s)]
*  It can make you a bit nihilistic. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4878.34s)]
*  And fighting for the hope and the good is so my mom says that to me all the time. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4881.46s)]
*  Because when I try to show her some of the things you and I talked about in the beginning, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4888.1s)]
*  and I'm like, don't you see? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4892.74s)]
*  And this is rigged. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4893.9400000000005s)]
*  And who's really pulling the strings? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4894.900000000001s)]
*  And these are bad guys. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4896.34s)]
*  And she's like, honey, I'm 76. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4897.3s)]
*  Like, leave me alone. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4900.42s)]
*  And that's fine. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4901.9400000000005s)]
*  I want to. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4902.74s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4903.38s)]
*  You know, she's like, I want to see the good in people. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4904.58s)]
*  Mr. Rogers, look for the helpers. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4908.18s)]
*  But you can fall into really becoming nihilistic about humanity [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4910.5s)]
*  when you witness these things and have these conversations. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4920.1s)]
*  And I try so hard to not go there in my head. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4923.22s)]
*  But it's hard not to. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4926.18s)]
*  Well, we are a primitive evolving species. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4927.38s)]
*  And we're still trapped with these primate bodies. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4932.5s)]
*  We're territorial primates with weapons. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4936.740000000001s)]
*  You know, and we're still trapped with the same instincts that got us to the dance, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4940.58s)]
*  the same instincts that caused us to create walled cities, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4945.780000000001s)]
*  which allowed us to survive. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4948.900000000001s)]
*  And then agriculture, which allowed us to develop surpluses. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4951.14s)]
*  And then people wanted those surpluses, nomads. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4954.9800000000005s)]
*  And they came in, the roving barbarians, the Mongolian hordes. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4957.3s)]
*  You know, this is like all part of our history. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4961.06s)]
*  And this is the battle of good versus evil. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4964.66s)]
*  And the battle of good versus evil, I think this duality has to exist. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4968.419999999999s)]
*  I think you have to have good to combat evil. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4972.419999999999s)]
*  And you have to have evil to keep good in check, like to enhance good [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4975.0599999999995s)]
*  and to force people to really to rise and to innovate [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4979.94s)]
*  and to figure out how to defeat evil without evil. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4986.099999999999s)]
*  And without the idea of these rovers, we never would have developed cities. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4989.0599999999995s)]
*  If we never developed cities, we never would have gone through the industrial revolution. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4993.62s)]
*  We wouldn't develop cities if we were just roving peaceful nomadic hunter gatherers. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=4996.82s)]
*  We would be the same. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5003.86s)]
*  It serves its purpose. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5005.14s)]
*  I've read all my Khalil Gibran. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5006.26s)]
*  It's like, oh, you know, the deeper your pain, like the more ability you have for empathy. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5008.34s)]
*  And I get all of it, but it's seemingly imbalanced now. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5014.26s)]
*  And I guess that's what I mean. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5018.66s)]
*  It's always like that. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5019.86s)]
*  But that's that is what causes people to strive to do better. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5020.66s)]
*  I hope you're right, Joe. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5024.74s)]
*  I think it is. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5025.94s)]
*  You're definitely one of those guys, which is which is why bringing it back to the very beginning. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5027.3s)]
*  I think that you're number one. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5032.74s)]
*  But I also think, you know, you're one out of quite a few. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5034.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I hope you're right. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5040.74s)]
*  You know, you have to have principles that you live your life by. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5042.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5046.66s)]
*  And be aware of evil. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5047.0599999999995s)]
*  But do your best to be good. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5050.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5052.179999999999s)]
*  And you see the fight without without evil. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5052.66s)]
*  Like you have no desire to be like, why? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5055.94s)]
*  Why be so why be wonderful? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5058.339999999999s)]
*  Why be kind and why? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5060.66s)]
*  There's no contrast. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5062.179999999999s)]
*  There's no nothing you're fighting against. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5063.46s)]
*  Like this is unfortunately what motivates. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5066.0199999999995s)]
*  What makes you choose, though? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5070.179999999999s)]
*  OK, so another thing that I've thought about often is like evil never stops going. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5071.54s)]
*  Have you ever heard that good has to decide when it gets out of bed in the morning? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5077.14s)]
*  Like you're on the freeway and someone's got to is broken down on the side of the freeway. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5082.1s)]
*  And it's like, do you are you late for something? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5086.900000000001s)]
*  Are you worried? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5090.26s)]
*  There are a million things that will influence whether or not I stop that day. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5091.22s)]
*  But a bad guy will always see an opportunity to go after that person. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5095.14s)]
*  Evil works tirelessly and good requires a sacrifice. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5100.660000000001s)]
*  You sacrifice yourself. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5105.22s)]
*  Evil is good. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5107.22s)]
*  Your mic just cut off. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5109.06s)]
*  Mine did? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5110.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5110.740000000001s)]
*  Do you disconnect the mic cable? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5111.240000000001s)]
*  Me? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5114.02s)]
*  No. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5114.52s)]
*  I think it's disconnected. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5115.02s)]
*  Too dark of a conversation. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5117.46s)]
*  It's like, that's it. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5118.740000000001s)]
*  No more of this dark shit. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5120.02s)]
*  Is it back now? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5122.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5123.22s)]
*  Well, that's weird. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5124.34s)]
*  I didn't even touch it. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5125.38s)]
*  It's happened before. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5126.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5126.9800000000005s)]
*  OK, this is evil. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5127.620000000001s)]
*  Evil's trying to stop me from saying the moment I'm saying there's more good than there is evil. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5129.9400000000005s)]
*  The mic disconnects. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5135.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think unfortunately, evil can co-op people. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5136.58s)]
*  Because good people can become evil when they experience so much evil that they have to [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5139.78s)]
*  become a monster and fight against monsters. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5144.74s)]
*  I'm seeing it even in the health space. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5146.98s)]
*  Sometimes I'll—Brigam is dealing with the FDA stuff right now. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5152.1s)]
*  And I was talking to him this morning and he's like, Gillian. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5156.1s)]
*  And he's talking about trying to compound peptides and there's a war on peptides and [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5158.74s)]
*  there's a war on stem cells. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5164.1s)]
*  And of course, it's like the cutting edge of medicine. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5166.02s)]
*  But he's describing what they're going up against in dealing with this. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5168.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's evil. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5172.660000000001s)]
*  Why would you want to prevent these life-saving treatments? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5174.660000000001s)]
*  Well, that's a perfect example. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5178.660000000001s)]
*  That's money. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5180.02s)]
*  And if money is the devil, that's a perfect example. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5180.9800000000005s)]
*  How much do you need though, Joe? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5184.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's not you though. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5186.18s)]
*  The problem is corporations—I'm sure you've seen this before. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5188.1s)]
*  Corporations behave like a psychopath. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5192.02s)]
*  Because corporations don't have humanity. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5195.3s)]
*  And when you have a corporation—which I don't know how we get away from not having [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5197.7s)]
*  corporations, so what's the solution there? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5201.860000000001s)]
*  But corporations have an obligation to their shareholders. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5203.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5207.3s)]
*  And sometimes you have to do fucked up things in order to make more money. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5207.78s)]
*  And that's—when you're in the business of drugs, like that's—look, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5212.18s)]
*  if you're in the business of making movies, I mean, what fucked up things can you do to [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5215.9400000000005s)]
*  make more movies and make movies that more people are going to see? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5220.42s)]
*  Really nothing. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5223.46s)]
*  It's like you just have to make them resonate with people. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5224.26s)]
*  But if you're selling drugs, boy, you can influence people. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5227.46s)]
*  You can lie about studies. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5230.74s)]
*  You can have your scientists perform studies and then throw out all the studies that don't [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5232.34s)]
*  jive with whatever you're trying to sell. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5237.38s)]
*  Combounding. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5239.7s)]
*  And then you can— [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5240.34s)]
*  Pharmacies kicking them out. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5240.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you compromise all these politicians and get them to repeat your narratives. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5242.9s)]
*  That should be illegal though. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5247.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5248.42s)]
*  That should be illegal. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5249.3s)]
*  You should be able to get rid of citizens united. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5250.42s)]
*  So how do you get it out? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5253.38s)]
*  You gotta reform campaign finance. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5255.06s)]
*  Do you remember many moons ago, I believe it was John Edwards, who was running on that [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5257.7s)]
*  many moons ago. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5262.82s)]
*  But as a kid, I didn't fully understand what that meant. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5264.1s)]
*  As an adult, no one's ever brought that—I mean, kind of brought any— [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5268.02s)]
*  Here's step one. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5271.22s)]
*  You gotta say they can't advertise. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5272.5s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5275.62s)]
*  Because not only is it not—advertising is not really the problem. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5276.66s)]
*  It's part of the problem. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5280.02s)]
*  But the real problem is when they advertise—and Callie Means talked about this extensively—now [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5281.06s)]
*  the media will not criticize them because they're responsible for an enormous percentage [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5286.34s)]
*  of their income. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5290.02s)]
*  70 plus percent. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5290.580000000001s)]
*  But the issue—I had this conversation recently and the issue's gonna be freedom of speech [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5291.54s)]
*  here. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5296.1s)]
*  It's gonna be a First Amendment fight. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5296.34s)]
*  But that's not a First Amendment thing. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5298.1s)]
*  They're gonna argue it is, Joe. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5299.9400000000005s)]
*  Because you could still do it on social media. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5300.18s)]
*  You could still make your own podcast if you're Pfizer. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5302.740000000001s)]
*  That's the angle they're gonna take. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5305.9400000000005s)]
*  I am sure of it. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5307.700000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5308.74s)]
*  But you can't advertise for cigarettes on television. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5308.9s)]
*  Why? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5312.099999999999s)]
*  Because we've decided— [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5312.42s)]
*  Kids, I think. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5313.219999999999s)]
*  I think it's kids. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5314.0199999999995s)]
*  I've heard this conversation. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5315.46s)]
*  And I'm trying to remember who one of the researchers was. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5317.94s)]
*  But Callie was there. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5320.26s)]
*  Mark Hyman was there. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5322.179999999999s)]
*  And they were having this exact conversation. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5323.78s)]
*  And one of the people on the other side was suggesting that they have already gamed this [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5325.86s)]
*  out. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5331.38s)]
*  And that's the way that they're gonna go. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5331.62s)]
*  Ironically, this is self-sabotage for the media itself because no one takes them seriously [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5334.740000000001s)]
*  anymore because they don't do that. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5340.02s)]
*  Because they don't criticize the pharmaceutical drug companies. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5341.9400000000005s)]
*  They don't talk about vaccine side effects. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5344.58s)]
*  They don't talk about pharmaceutical drug side effects. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5346.900000000001s)]
*  They don't. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5349.22s)]
*  They make you look like you're insane when you do. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5349.780000000001s)]
*  You're a crazy person. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5351.38s)]
*  I was on CNN talking about Ozempic one time. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5352.26s)]
*  And they essentially called me anti-science because I suggested that a lot of the drugs— [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5355.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, well, we give people statins and we give people blood pressure medication. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5360.66s)]
*  Don't look at the fucking data on statins, by the way. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5365.3s)]
*  I was initiating that conversation. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5368.9s)]
*  And I was called anti-science. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5372.82s)]
*  That's not even anti-science. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5375.38s)]
*  They don't understand the data. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5376.9s)]
*  They won't even allow you to express that on the show anyway. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5378.58s)]
*  They're never again invited on CNN. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5383.54s)]
*  Because they're compromised. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5387.3s)]
*  It's not really news. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5388.58s)]
*  It's only the news that they feel compelled to talk about due to their financial interests. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5390.26s)]
*  Yeah, they buy the narrative across the board. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5396.1s)]
*  But the problem with that, look at the ratings on CNN. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5397.22s)]
*  They're fucking collapsing. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5399.46s)]
*  And they're in a spiral. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5400.900000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5402.58s)]
*  Because no one trusts them anymore. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5402.9800000000005s)]
*  So the public trust has been eroded because of their own desire to make more money. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5405.22s)]
*  There's an opportunity where a network wanted me to compete against these GLP-1 drugs. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5410.42s)]
*  And everyone loves the idea. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5417.780000000001s)]
*  But the top concern is, oh, what if Gillian wins? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5420.02s)]
*  And then it'll be a catastrophe. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5424.820000000001s)]
*  So the ad sales department is like, I don't know if we can do this. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5426.820000000001s)]
*  We can't call it Gillian versus we can't call it that. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5430.18s)]
*  What are we going to call it? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5432.42s)]
*  I don't know how we're going to position this. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5433.38s)]
*  And I was like, we don't even need to bash it. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5434.820000000001s)]
*  Let me just do my job. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5437.62s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5438.660000000001s)]
*  But they're even afraid. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5440.26s)]
*  Like, God forbid, I won. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5441.860000000001s)]
*  And was able to do it naturally. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5443.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you think there's an argument for GLP-1 drugs, though, for people who are morbidly [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5446.02s)]
*  obese? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5450.580000000001s)]
*  Because I kind of do. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5450.9800000000005s)]
*  OK. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5451.9400000000005s)]
*  So here's where I've gotten to on all medications, largely. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5452.34s)]
*  It's a cost-benefit analysis. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5458.820000000001s)]
*  So if you brought an individual who was morbidly obese and already had [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5461.06s)]
*  atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5466.42s)]
*  and you said, we've tried everything, they're a death store. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5471.38s)]
*  And this is arguably the last step. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5474.58s)]
*  Well, in that case, the downsides of the medications are far less than not trying it. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5477.54s)]
*  So in that instance, you could twist my arm for sure. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5485.22s)]
*  But if you gave me my way, I would prefer to look at what the medications like Ibogaine [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5489.62s)]
*  or psilocybin could do for the psychological component, the addictive component. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5497.86s)]
*  One treatment. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5502.9s)]
*  Doesn't go on forever. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5504.34s)]
*  And then, because diet and exercise do work. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5505.7s)]
*  What's stopping them from engaging in those habits consistently is all the stuff we talked [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5508.98s)]
*  about in the beginning, the psychological component, the physical addiction. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5514.18s)]
*  So no one's ever tried it, though. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5517.38s)]
*  So there's no way to actually know. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5519.46s)]
*  And you can't. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5521.3s)]
*  It's almost impossible to do the research on it, which is, again, why the Texas Ibogaine [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5523.06s)]
*  Initiative is so important. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5527.46s)]
*  Because you can begin this kind of research, although it is in veterans and addiction and [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5528.82s)]
*  so on. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5532.34s)]
*  But would that be the first step? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5532.66s)]
*  And when I've asked the people in the space, like Matt Shepard, for example, who is at [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5534.82s)]
*  Shepard Pratt and one of the guys that's the foremost experts on psilocybin and treating [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5540.18s)]
*  addiction, he's like, yeah, theoretically, it would work great. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5545.78s)]
*  Theoretically. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5548.98s)]
*  So for me, if we got all the way to this place and I had no choice, that's like saying, Jill, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5550.42s)]
*  if someone had stage four cancer, would you do chemo? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5556.26s)]
*  I mean, I guess so. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5558.42s)]
*  But I'd like to if there was an alternative way forward or if we could prevent it to begin [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5559.54s)]
*  with, that would be ideal. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5563.94s)]
*  So you could twist my arm to that point. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5565.06s)]
*  I think there's something to be said for, again, what Brigham is doing at Ways to Well, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5567.22s)]
*  which is why being able to compound the GLP-1 drugs allows you to titrate the dose. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5570.5s)]
*  So when people argue with me on this matter, they'll suggest that a titrated dose, a lesser [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5577.38s)]
*  amount of these drugs can be effective with significantly less side effects. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5583.38s)]
*  But when they're trying to block that and you can't even explore it. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5587.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's all weird because I think the problem also is competition, right? [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5591.38s)]
*  If Ibogaine becomes ubiquitous and these clinics become everywhere, the real issue becomes [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5597.7s)]
*  how much does that compete with the pharmaceutical drug market's value? [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5604.42s)]
*  How much does that decrease their ability to profit? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5609.62s)]
*  And it's probably significantly. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5613.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, if it impacts antidepressants alone, that's significant. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5615.46s)]
*  And if one treatment could have the impact on obesity that it does on opioid addiction, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5620.1s)]
*  GLP-1s are the most profitable drug of all time. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5630.42s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5633.38s)]
*  If they do allow the use of Ibogaine and then also they allow the use of psilocybin, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5634.82s)]
*  if more people start taking it, more people are not going to buy whatever the pharmaceutical [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5640.18s)]

*  You're always going to have fools. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5649.06s)]
*  You're always going to have people that just want to, what do I take? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5650.900000000001s)]
*  I'll take it. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5653.54s)]
*  There's always going to be people like that. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5655.14s)]
*  And those people are there to give you a lesson without you having to fall prey [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5657.46s)]
*  to the folly that they have fallen prey to. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5663.62s)]
*  I think that's the same with a lot of addictions, particularly gambling addiction. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5667.54s)]
*  I'm in Vegas all the time and I don't gamble. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5671.86s)]
*  I've played blackjack for fun, but like 20 bucks here, I don't get it. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5674.82s)]
*  But I see it. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5680.74s)]
*  I see it. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5682.0199999999995s)]
*  I see that crazed look in that. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5682.74s)]
*  I think gambling addiction is one of the weirder ones. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5685.139999999999s)]
*  I've been around it a good portion of my life and it's the sweaty fucking faces. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5688.099999999999s)]
*  This need to gamble is really nuts. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5695.7s)]
*  And that's another part of the human reward system that's been hijacked. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5699.06s)]
*  Intermittent rewarding is the most powerful. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5703.38s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5705.860000000001s)]
*  It's the study, have you ever seen it with like the rats where they push the button, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5706.660000000001s)]
*  no food comes out. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5710.26s)]
*  Push the button, food comes out. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5711.06s)]
*  So the ones that get the intermittent food reward will sit there and push that damn button [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5712.820000000001s)]
*  until they collapse of exhaustion. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5717.22s)]
*  The ones that push for a little while get nothing, give up. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5718.900000000001s)]
*  The ones that push until they get food every time, get full and give up. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5721.14s)]
*  Slot machine logic, it's the same thing. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5724.1s)]
*  Yep. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5726.1s)]
*  It's that intermittent reinforcement. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5726.580000000001s)]
*  It's exceptionally powerful. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5728.42s)]
*  Easy to manipulate. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5729.54s)]
*  We're weird creatures. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5730.74s)]
*  I know. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5732.26s)]
*  And it's again, it's all our survival instincts get hijacked. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5733.46s)]
*  But if you gave them an alternative path when they are ready for help, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5736.9800000000005s)]
*  when the horse is ready to drink and you had an alternative method that we're seeing work. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5742.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5748.58s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5749.78s)]
*  We have to have freedom of the use of these alternative methods. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5750.42s)]
*  And I think naturally those would overcome. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5753.3s)]
*  They would succeed. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5756.9s)]
*  I think you'd still probably have gambling addicts. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5758.1s)]
*  You still probably would have people that want to take all the pharmaceutical drugs, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5760.34s)]
*  like whatever the doctor wants to prescribe to them. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5764.42s)]
*  But it would be less and less. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5766.1s)]
*  And they don't want that, which is why you're seeing the pushback from the FDA with peptides [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5767.860000000001s)]
*  and all these different things is because they're concerned that if you give people [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5772.42s)]
*  a bunch of things that are going to make them healthy, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5775.620000000001s)]
*  they're not going to take as many pharmaceutical drugs. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5777.14s)]
*  Which is why there's no model for prevention in health care. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5779.860000000001s)]
*  It's not profitable at all. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5783.14s)]
*  But it's ridiculous. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5786.42s)]
*  There's a peptide called cerebralizing that they give to stroke patients in other parts [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5787.46s)]
*  of the developed world that can have a massive impact as well on cognitive function and can [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5794.18s)]
*  be neuroprotective. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5799.06s)]
*  You can't even buy it here. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5800.66s)]
*  Literally. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5802.9s)]
*  I had to find it in Austria, ship it into the country and Brigham and Dr. Rexford, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5803.86s)]
*  I was like, now what do I do with this? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5809.78s)]
*  Brigham had to walk me through how to use it on freaking FaceTime. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5813.14s)]
*  You just snap it. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5816.74s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5817.94s)]
*  It is insane. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5819.54s)]
*  It's pretty crazy. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5820.66s)]
*  And I like it. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5821.46s)]
*  By the way, there's a new stroke drug that I actually just sent my friend Rich [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5823.3s)]
*  because our friend Keith Robinson, I don't have his number, but he suffered from a stroke. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5827.38s)]
*  And there's some new drug that I'll send this to Jamie. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5831.7s)]
*  These UCLA scientists have developed. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5836.74s)]
*  Oh, you got it already. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5840.18s)]
*  They developed first drug rehabilitation to repair brain damage. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5841.22s)]
*  Drug replicated the recovery of movement control produced by rehab in mice. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5845.54s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5850.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5851.54s)]
*  So this is March 18th. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5851.94s)]
*  New study by UCLA health has discovered what researchers say is the first drug [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5854.34s)]
*  to fully reproduce the effects of physical stroke rehabilitation [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5859.3s)]
*  in model mice following from human studies. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5864.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5868.02s)]
*  So which is wonderful. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5868.9s)]
*  This is the benefit of psych of pharmaceutical drugs. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5870.9s)]
*  There are some pharmaceutical drugs that are wonderful. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5874.26s)]
*  So the goal is to have a medicine that stroke patients can take [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5876.9800000000005s)]
*  that produces the effects of rehabilitation. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5879.3s)]
*  Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael, the study's lead author and professor and chair of UCLA neurology. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5883.06s)]
*  Rehabilitation after stroke is limited. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5888.900000000001s)]
*  It's actual effects because most patients cannot sustain the rehab intensity needed [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5890.9800000000005s)]
*  for stroke recovery. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5894.74s)]
*  Further stroke recovery is not like most other fields of medicine [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5896.26s)]
*  where drugs are available to treat the disease such as cardiology, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5900.1s)]
*  infectious disease or cancer. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5902.98s)]
*  Carmichael said rehabilitation is a physical medicine approach [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5904.5s)]
*  that has been around for decades. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5907.62s)]
*  We need to move rehabilitation into an era of molecular medicine. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5908.98s)]
*  So this is why you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5913.139999999999s)]
*  It's always like that though. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5916.66s)]
*  Everything is a U-shaped curve. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5918.179999999999s)]
*  There's drugs that the pharmaceutical drug companies make that help people [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5920.0199999999995s)]
*  and heal them and fix them and save their lives. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5923.54s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5927.0599999999995s)]
*  It's great. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5928.419999999999s)]
*  It's like, but it is that Goldilocks is... [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5928.9s)]
*  Just like you have to keep your kids from eating all the sugar. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5932.1s)]
*  Completely. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5934.820000000001s)]
*  I just got whooping cough and Joe, I literally thought I was going to die. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5935.9400000000005s)]
*  I ended up at week seven. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5942.740000000001s)]
*  I called my internist and I was like, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5945.38s)]
*  I think you need to check me in the fucking hospital. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5946.900000000001s)]
*  This is insane. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5949.06s)]
*  I think I'm going to die. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5949.860000000001s)]
*  And they hit me with the horns. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5950.820000000001s)]
*  And the long story short is I am vaccinated for it, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5952.820000000001s)]
*  but I guess my vaccination or my booster is old. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5955.22s)]
*  I don't even remember the last time I got it. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5959.54s)]
*  My wife is vaccinated. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5961.3s)]
*  My kids are vaccinated for it. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5962.42s)]
*  My mom is vaccinated for it. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5963.78s)]
*  Everybody in my circle is vaccinated. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5964.9800000000005s)]
*  No one got it. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5967.9400000000005s)]
*  I strongly recommend getting your DTaP vaccine because whooping cough, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5969.3s)]
*  it was a hundred days of it. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5976.18s)]
*  So for my point being, I don't want the COVID vaccine. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5978.26s)]
*  I don't want the COVID vaccine and I don't need it. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5982.26s)]
*  But in any universe for me personally, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5985.22s)]
*  I would, if I would have known I was behind on that booster, [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5988.26s)]
*  it's like everything has a cost benefit analysis. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5991.54s)]
*  Everything. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5994.1s)]
*  It's like the dose is what makes the poison. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5994.74s)]
*  Everything is that U-shaped curve and approaching it with nuance [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=5997.38s)]
*  is really the only intelligent way forward to make the best decisions for yourself. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6002.26s)]
*  But you need the right information to do that. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6005.94s)]
*  And we need to have actual access to data. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6007.78s)]
*  And this is a real problem that we've had in the last few decades [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6010.82s)]
*  because there's been this revolving door between the FDA and pharmaceutical drug companies. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6015.94s)]
*  So people that had, I think it's like seven out of eight heads of the FDA [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6020.82s)]
*  went on to work for pharmaceutical drug companies. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6024.82s)]
*  Revolving door, a hundred percent. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6026.74s)]
*  Which, so you've developed these relationships with these pharmaceutical drug companies [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6027.86s)]
*  where you're like, they're funding the studies, they're funding all, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6031.86s)]
*  and then you leave and then you go to work for them and you get a nice cushy job. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6035.139999999999s)]
*  So you kind of like look sideways. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6038.339999999999s)]
*  I can make it worse. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6042.179999999999s)]
*  I was, when I was at the Senate testimony, I can't remember how many months ago that was, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6043.459999999999s)]
*  but CaliMeans had us meeting with different senators and their aides. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6048.58s)]
*  And a kid came up to me and I of course brought that up. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6052.099999999999s)]
*  And he's like, it's so much worse than that. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6054.099999999999s)]
*  And I was like, elaborate. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6056.179999999999s)]
*  What do you mean it's so much worse than that? [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6057.62s)]
*  And he said essentially they develop the drug, have stock in the company, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6059.7s)]
*  go to work at the FDA, approve the drug and go back to the drug company. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6064.419999999999s)]
*  So yeah, I was like, oh, there's another step. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6069.780000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6075.22s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6075.7s)]
*  It should be completely illegal. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6076.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6079.54s)]
*  I mean, want to talk about a conflict of interest. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6079.860000000001s)]
*  That's the biggest conflict ever. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6082.02s)]
*  And you're dealing with billions of dollars in profit. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6083.46s)]
*  I was working on a book or have been working on a book [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6088.18s)]
*  where it looks at each and every law that was put into place with good intentions. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6091.22s)]
*  In a word, the hell is paved with good intentions. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6097.46s)]
*  And how each and every one was co-opted by big food, big ag or big pharma [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6100.02s)]
*  to wreck complete havoc and destruction. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6105.14s)]
*  And that's what you see. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6108.26s)]
*  That's what you see. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6109.3s)]
*  And you're going to keep seeing that if nothing gets changed. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6110.1s)]
*  And that's what's encouraging about this administration. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6112.66s)]
*  So the thing that I was most excited about was Bobby Kennedy. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6116.34s)]
*  When Bobby Kennedy united with Trump, I was like, okay, I'm in. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6120.42s)]
*  If he can get in there, you can see real change that's going to affect the way our lives are [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6124.580000000001s)]
*  forever. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6131.06s)]
*  That's going to change things. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6132.18s)]
*  It's going to give people a real understanding of what's going on behind the scenes, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6133.38s)]
*  why you've been lied to, why all these drugs are everywhere, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6138.26s)]
*  why you're seeing poor health outcomes, why we're the richest nation in the world, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6141.620000000001s)]
*  but also the sickest. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6145.540000000001s)]
*  And across the board with education, we're the richest nation in the world. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6148.26s)]
*  We have terrible education scores. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6152.1s)]
*  Why? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6154.34s)]
*  Since we developed the Department of Education, have our scores plummeted? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6154.74s)]
*  What is that? [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6160.0199999999995s)]
*  And again, road to hell, good intentions. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6160.82s)]
*  100%. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6162.9s)]
*  I was speaking with Kelly and he's like, don't pull punches because you want to be diplomatic. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6163.54s)]
*  But I am finding myself defending Kennedy, who by the way, I've met twice. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6172.099999999999s)]
*  I have no, I don't work for this administration. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6177.78s)]
*  I have no personal affiliation. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6181.0599999999995s)]
*  It's just right and wrong. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6183.78s)]
*  There is a huge problem that needs to be addressed and this administration wants to address it. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6186.0199999999995s)]
*  And yet you are seeing the resistance. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6191.7s)]
*  You are seeing the opposition flood the zone with hysteria. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6194.18s)]
*  24 fucking 7 and it's crazy. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6199.38s)]
*  It's constantly taking people off piste. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6203.54s)]
*  Like, oh, I actually did an interview the other day on News Nation where the host is like, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6206.42s)]
*  well, he promised results on autism by September and that's unrealistic. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6211.38s)]
*  And I was like, who gives a fuck if it's unrealistic? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6215.22s)]
*  Aren't you glad we're looking at it? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6217.38s)]
*  It's genetic. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6219.38s)]
*  I'm like, do you really believe that? [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6219.9400000000005s)]
*  Why would anybody say that without doing decades of research themselves? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6221.7s)]
*  I cannot. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6226.5s)]
*  Do you really think? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6228.58s)]
*  Do you know California's it's now some insane number like one in 12 boys? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6229.86s)]
*  It's higher in California, obviously than anywhere else in the country. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6236.18s)]
*  And boys in particular over girls. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6239.62s)]
*  But the reality is that we don't know. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6242.5s)]
*  Well, they also think that one of the reasons why it's boys over girls is like in girls, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6245.78s)]
*  it's like less obvious. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6250.0199999999995s)]
*  It's less diagnosed. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6251.86s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6253.3s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6253.86s)]
*  I'm not sure if that's true either because that's the argument. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6254.98s)]
*  Also, it's like, oh, autism has always been here. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6257.46s)]
*  It's just it just hasn't been diagnosed correctly. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6259.62s)]
*  That was debunked though by the Mind Institute at UC Davis was like, no, the bullshit. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6262.42s)]
*  It was one in 150 20 years ago. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6267.86s)]
*  People don't want to admit they did that to their kids. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6270.98s)]
*  And so they will defend it to the death. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6274.18s)]
*  Just like people who have turned their kids trans don't want to admit that these [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6276.0199999999995s)]
*  are chemical castration drugs. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6280.099999999999s)]
*  They don't want to admit it. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6282.099999999999s)]
*  They don't want to admit that they possibly have contributed to mental disease, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6283.14s)]
*  their mental health disease, to anxiety and depression and suicide. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6286.5s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6291.22s)]
*  Would you rather have a live boy or a dead girl? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6291.86s)]
*  Like what? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6295.0599999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6295.86s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6296.74s)]
*  But it's a closed system. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6298.179999999999s)]
*  And what I mean by that is even if I did the gimme, oh, you're right. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6299.62s)]
*  Autism is genetic. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6304.74s)]
*  Well, what about the rise in early onset cancer diagnosis, the rise in obesity, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6305.86s)]
*  the steady increase of infertility year after year after year? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6310.42s)]
*  We went from adult onset diabetes to type two diabetes because children have type two diabetes. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6315.86s)]
*  Now, it's come on. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6321.0599999999995s)]
*  How far you want to push it? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6323.54s)]
*  People are not stupid. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6325.7s)]
*  They're not. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6327.54s)]
*  You can capture them to a point. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6328.5s)]
*  But when the evidence is overwhelming, we are sicker than ever. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6331.3s)]
*  And the resistance is mind blowing to this guy every day. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6335.62s)]
*  Oh, well, now, you know, he fired the guy that's tracking gonorrhea. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6340.74s)]
*  I mean, where fucking got them for God's sake? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6347.139999999999s)]
*  Hopefully that guy will get his job back. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6351.62s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he's also tackling the grass rule and trying to get to the bottom of [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6353.94s)]
*  autism and getting poison out of baby formula and removing soda from snaps. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6358.74s)]
*  It's just like, where is the perspective for the general public to read through the media bullshit? [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6364.58s)]
*  Well, the problem is it's gone tribal. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6371.299999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6373.219999999999s)]
*  And when you have an us versus them thing going on, which is what we do here in this country, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6373.7s)]
*  I keep seeing people online saying in these dark times. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6379.62s)]
*  Are these times so dark? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6383.86s)]
*  What is happening? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6384.98s)]
*  You know, it's dark. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6387.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6388.0199999999995s)]
*  If you're living in Gaza, it's pretty fucking dark. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6388.26s)]
*  If you live in Ukraine, pretty dark. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6390.18s)]
*  But here, have things gone dark? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6392.18s)]
*  Everything is spondy. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6395.86s)]
*  Like this totalitarian regime. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6396.34s)]
*  What's totalitarian? [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6399.14s)]
*  That they're cutting fraud and waste? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6400.5s)]
*  Have you paid attention to the fraud and waste? [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6402.42s)]
*  Have you paid attention to the fact they spent $250 million on transgender animal studies? [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6404.0199999999995s)]
*  Where's your fucking money going? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6409.62s)]
*  You're not concerned with this unchecked spending that this government has been able to do for a [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6411.86s)]
*  decade upon decade and these millions of NGOs? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6416.9s)]
*  Do you know there's an NGO in India for every 600 people? [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6420.339999999999s)]
*  I have heard it's the CIA. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6426.099999999999s)]
*  I've watched that episode with my friends. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6427.78s)]
*  There's 3.3 million NGOs in India. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6429.54s)]

*  If you can prove that this is also the problem with charities, [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6454.42s)]
*  this is the dark truth of charities, is that most charities, the money goes to bureaucracy. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6459.139999999999s)]
*  A huge percentage of it goes to overhead. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6464.179999999999s)]
*  In fact, most charities, the vast majority of the money never gets to the charity. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6466.74s)]

*  It wasn't even. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6484.5s)]

*  It's both. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6487.86s)]
*  Well, my friend, Colleyon Noir, he brought this up and I was never aware of it until he said it. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6488.58s)]
*  He went to San Francisco and he saw the rampant, and he's a lawyer. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6493.62s)]

*  what is the problem? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6500.9s)]
*  There's not enough funding. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6501.46s)]
*  And a guy over there going, no, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6502.82s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6505.38s)]
*  There's a business now. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6506.5s)]
*  So these people that are working in the homeless, whatever the organization, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6508.099999999999s)]
*  they're making a quarter million dollars a year. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6513.46s)]
*  Half a million in some cases. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6514.98s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen Anna Kasparian talk about this, but she [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6517.3s)]
*  can elaborate on this subject matter to the point that you literally want to forcibly remove [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6520.9800000000005s)]
*  Gavin Newsom from all of this. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6528.9800000000005s)]
*  It is staggering. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6531.14s)]
*  And some of them half a million bucks and nothing. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6533.06s)]
*  They're doing a great job. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6536.5s)]
*  Just imagine if they weren't there, how much homeless we'd have. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6537.620000000001s)]
*  We'd all be homeless. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6539.780000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6540.5s)]
*  You've seen him talk about- [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6542.02s)]
*  Everyone would be homeless, so just relax. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6542.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I just had this conversation actually. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6544.660000000001s)]
*  I was talking to Corolla and he was telling me that Gavin Newsom had told him back in the day [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6548.26s)]
*  that the face of homelessness was not addiction and mental illness. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6552.58s)]
*  It was women and children. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6556.9800000000005s)]
*  And there's a loophole. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6560.26s)]
*  A friend of mine who's a reporter with the New York Times looked into it because she's like, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6561.780000000001s)]
*  why didn't you push back on that? [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6567.3s)]
*  Because he's right. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6568.66s)]
*  She goes, no, no, no, no, no, I looked into it and it's women and children. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6569.780000000001s)]
*  Then she ended up getting to the bottom of the loophole. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6572.1s)]
*  And the way that he was able to put forward that narrative is that homeless [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6575.14s)]
*  is a person without a stable address and that's predominantly women and children. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6579.46s)]
*  But unsheltered is what we consider homeless, the people in the streets and the tent camps. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6583.46s)]
*  And arguably that is largely- [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6589.700000000001s)]
*  So what is, I don't understand, what's the definition? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6591.62s)]
*  So Newsom was saying to Corolla, like, you're so insensitive and the face of- [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6594.900000000001s)]
*  Do children don't own homes? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6601.14s)]
*  He was saying that women, like the mom that owns two jobs, that's who I'm trying to save. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6602.82s)]
*  We don't need to tackle addiction and we don't need to tackle mental illness because this is [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6608.58s)]
*  about the underprivileged individual, the female single mom with two kids who, you know, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6614.5s)]
*  this is the face of homelessness. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6620.98s)]
*  And Corolla was like, you're a sociopath. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6622.34s)]
*  It's addicts and people with mental illness. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6624.66s)]
*  And I ended up then in a debate with this journalist who's lovely, named Molly, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6629.3s)]
*  and she's like, well, the statistics say that homelessness is in fact women and children. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6635.62s)]
*  But when I challenged her and sent her San Francisco, whatever, we go back and forth, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6639.86s)]
*  and she ended up coming back to me after doing the homework and there is a distinction [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6644.34s)]
*  between homeless and unsheltered. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6648.66s)]
*  So homeless are people with unstable addresses and that is women and children. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6652.42s)]
*  How, why? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6658.9800000000005s)]
*  In a temporary, I couldn't quite extrapolate what- [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6660.5s)]
*  So is it like divorce? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6665.22s)]
*  I guess it's like in temporary housing or in an apartment somewhere, but unsheltered, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6666.9800000000005s)]
*  the people on the street that you and I would go, homeless. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6675.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6679.62s)]
*  In the tent camp outside on the sidewalk. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6680.5s)]
*  So they're playing semantics. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6683.22s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6685.22s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6686.1s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to get at. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6686.9800000000005s)]
*  Gross. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6688.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6688.820000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6690.1s)]
*  I cannot stand the guy. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6690.820000000001s)]
*  If you see these tech communities, you see clearly that you're dealing with drug addiction [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6691.860000000001s)]
*  and mental illness. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6696.740000000001s)]
*  But don't believe what you see with your own eyes. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6697.38s)]
*  That's the game across the board. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6701.540000000001s)]
*  Don't believe your common sense. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6704.26s)]
*  Common sense would dictate all the things we talked about. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6707.540000000001s)]
*  Autism is increasing. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6710.02s)]
*  We shouldn't give sex change. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6711.46s)]
*  We shouldn't sterilize 12-year-olds. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6712.42s)]
*  They all, but don't believe any of that. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6713.9400000000005s)]
*  Don't believe that people who are homeless need help psychologically, need some way to [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6716.18s)]
*  treat the addiction. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6723.06s)]
*  Obviously, there are more intelligent people like Schellenberger that have a plan for this, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6723.860000000001s)]
*  despite the fact that he didn't get into the governor's office, which is a shame because [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6728.9800000000005s)]
*  he would have done far better than what California is dealing with now. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6733.9400000000005s)]
*  But it's this constant game and manipulation of the facts all the time. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6737.3s)]
*  And this is where, if I could do one thing in my job, it's teaching people how to [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6743.3s)]
*  defer back to their common sense. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6751.3s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6754.42s)]
*  Common sense is not that common, right? [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6756.74s)]
*  No. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6759.14s)]
*  It's also people are tired because they have a poor diet and they're not eating well. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6759.62s)]
*  And so they don't have the time to be thinking about this stuff. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6764.1s)]
*  They don't have the mental energy to research these things. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6766.1s)]
*  They're overwhelmed with bills and debt and maybe relationship problems. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6769.38s)]
*  There's so many problems that people have already. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6777.22s)]
*  To get them to look at external issues that maybe don't affect them personally on a day-to-day [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6779.54s)]
*  basis, it's very difficult to get people to focus on that. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6784.740000000001s)]
*  So then they vote with what they think is their virtue. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6787.46s)]
*  Blue no matter who. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6792.34s)]
*  Vote Democrat no matter what. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6793.46s)]
*  That's not helping you. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6795.780000000001s)]
*  And then when you abandon it and leave, you're called a traitor. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6797.54s)]
*  You're a traitor to the party. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6801.62s)]
*  You must get that a lot. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6803.94s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6804.82s)]
*  Well, I went through all of it. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6805.86s)]
*  But then when you finally decide it doesn't matter anymore, you become immune. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6806.82s)]
*  So I was, it's interesting. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6811.78s)]
*  Back in the day when I, my friend used to refer to me in this capacity, she'd say, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6814.0199999999995s)]

*  to help people. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6830.5s)]
*  And then the very same person with the very same belief system and the very same strategies [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6831.22s)]
*  in dealing with the problem became the ultimate enemy. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6837.06s)]
*  The ultimate fat shamer, the ultimate science denier. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6839.86s)]
*  And it just goes to show you how the narrative shift. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6843.94s)]
*  It's tough to call me a transphobe because I fall under that acronym umbrella. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6846.18s)]
*  Despite the fact that gay is different, very different than trans. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6852.26s)]
*  I've never really understood the acronym either. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6854.900000000001s)]
*  What's a trap? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6856.74s)]
*  It completely. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6857.7s)]
*  But you can't say like, go ahead. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6859.06s)]
*  I'm a homophobe. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6861.78s)]
*  Like come at me, bro. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6862.74s)]
*  You're literally gay. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6864.42s)]
*  It's a tough one. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6865.46s)]
*  You know, I'm married to a woman. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6866.1s)]
*  It's tough to like, you can try. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6868.900000000001s)]
*  I haven't been hit with a racist card, although I'm waiting for it. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6870.42s)]
*  I don't know, maybe because my kid is Haitian and she gives me a pass. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6874.58s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6878.42s)]
*  But you get certain protections simply because you're a card carrying member of the club. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6880.1s)]
*  But I got hit with everything outside of that, you know, transphobe, not ish, ish fat shamer [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6888.02s)]
*  and anti-science and ableist and privileged and all that stuff. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6894.02s)]
*  Yeah, but all that stuff is losing its meaning. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6898.26s)]
*  The problem is you keep calling people, you call everyone a racist. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6900.82s)]
*  It doesn't mean anymore. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6904.1s)]
*  You're crying wolf so many times that people don't listen anymore. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6904.82s)]
*  Like a real racist is horrific. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6907.94s)]
*  You run into a real racist like, oh my God, that's horrific. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6910.98s)]
*  But, you know, if you just call everyone a racist, if you go math is racist, like, okay, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6915.219999999999s)]
*  math racist, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6920.66s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6924.339999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6925.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, I haven't seen that one. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6925.719999999999s)]
*  Exercise is racist. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6927.299999999999s)]
*  I've seen that. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6928.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6929.379999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6930.179999999999s)]
*  Wonderful. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6930.66s)]
*  All right. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6931.139999999999s)]
*  MSNBC. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6931.7s)]
*  Wonderful. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6932.58s)]
*  All right. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6932.98s)]
*  I liked that. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6933.379999999999s)]
*  I like that one a lot. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6934.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6935.62s)]
*  I will tell you though, I don't think that it is losing as much power as I had hoped. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6936.02s)]
*  And I reference Elon Musk and here's why. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6942.660000000001s)]
*  It's seemingly working. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6946.740000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of people that think he's an anti-Semite. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6948.5s)]
*  I'm like, you sure about that? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6952.900000000001s)]
*  Well, they think he's a Nazi. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6955.860000000001s)]
*  More than just an anti-Semite. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6957.620000000001s)]
*  Like an actual Nazi. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6958.9800000000005s)]
*  And these are reasonable people. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6960.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6962.5s)]
*  And here's the irony. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6962.820000000001s)]
*  He's on the spectrum. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6963.860000000001s)]
*  So this thing, he didn't even realize what he's doing. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6965.46s)]
*  The heart gesture. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6968.34s)]
*  My heart goes out to you. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6969.78s)]
*  But Joe, what about the video, the montage of all the liberals, including AOC, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6971.299999999999s)]
*  engaging in the same sig-hale. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6977.7s)]
*  Tim Walsh, I love you all. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6981.7s)]
*  It's like a thing that people have to stop doing. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6985.54s)]
*  But that's- [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6987.7s)]
*  You got to do it like this. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6988.259999999999s)]
*  You got to have two hands, touch your heart and then- [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6990.259999999999s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6993.219999999999s)]
*  When I was getting in trouble with CNN during the vaccine days, the COVID days, [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=6994.42s)]
*  they would use a photograph of me from the UFC weigh-ins. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7000.1s)]
*  Because when I go to the UFC weigh-ins, I say, welcome to the weigh-ins, everybody. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7003.3s)]
*  So they had this photo of me from the side with my arm. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7007.9400000000005s)]
*  That's the one they used all the time. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7010.9800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7013.78s)]
*  People buy that shit and they are still buying it. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7016.02s)]
*  And that scares me. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7019.54s)]
*  And in an argument on Piers Morgan, this is it, raise my voice a little bit. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7021.86s)]
*  I was like, well, I don't know. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7027.139999999999s)]
*  I don't think he's an anti-Semite. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7028.179999999999s)]
*  Number one, he's friends with the Jews. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7029.38s)]
*  Number two, he hires Jews. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7031.46s)]
*  And number three, he hasn't killed any Jews. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7032.58s)]
*  And they were- [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7034.0199999999995s)]
*  He has a necklace around his neck that he's given to one of the mothers of the hostages. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7034.42s)]
*  It says bring them home. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7037.78s)]
*  I remember him going after October 7th and talking about the videos that he'd seen. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7039.38s)]
*  But the guy was like, oh, that's your benchmark. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7044.099999999999s)]
*  He doesn't kill Jews. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7045.94s)]
*  And I was like, no, that's yours. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7046.82s)]
*  You're the one comparing him to Hitler who killed six million Jews. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7048.42s)]
*  So if you're going to draw that comparison, zero, six million. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7052.42s)]
*  So shut the fuck up. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7055.78s)]
*  It's all dumb. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7057.9400000000005s)]
*  But it's all a trick because what they're really doing is going after him [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7059.06s)]
*  because he's trying to go after USAID. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7063.7s)]
*  I see that. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7067.06s)]
*  That's their slush fund. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7067.54s)]
*  But can I tell you how many reasonable people? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7068.42s)]
*  I have friends that I have to argue about it with. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7073.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7075.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7076.18s)]
*  That's when I tell you, I don't know that it's actually losing its power. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7076.74s)]
*  It is. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7081.219999999999s)]
*  It's just not losing its power with really fucking dumb people. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7082.26s)]
*  And you're going to have a certain percentage of really fucking dumb people. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7085.54s)]
*  And they're either going to have to catch up or we're going to have to overwhelm them [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7088.099999999999s)]
*  with a lot of logic. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7091.7s)]
*  That. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7092.98s)]
*  And that takes time. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7093.46s)]
*  And it takes a lot of these kind of conversations and they get out there and they get clipped. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7094.42s)]
*  And maybe you and I said something here that will be taken out of context and used against you, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7098.5s)]
*  which is always really fun. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7102.9s)]
*  That's my favorite. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7104.66s)]
*  Let me just take like a snippet of it. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7105.94s)]
*  See? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7107.94s)]
*  Told you. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7108.34s)]
*  She's a this. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7108.9800000000005s)]
*  She's a that. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7110.42s)]
*  I know. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7111.38s)]
*  It's this reductionist thing where they try to define you by a string of words. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7112.02s)]
*  Forget about your whole life. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7117.46s)]
*  They did that to Candace Owens. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7118.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7120.34s)]
*  Oh, she's disgusting anti-Semite. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7120.66s)]
*  So I listened to her. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7123.14s)]
*  I listened to her answer, all that stuff on her show. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7124.5s)]
*  And then I listened to her debate it with Rabbi Schmolley and I thought, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7127.7s)]
*  okay, let's see what a bitch she is. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7131.46s)]
*  And I listened to everything she said and I checked it all and watched it in context. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7133.54s)]
*  And then I actually sat with her and I was like, all right, I can open the door. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7137.3s)]
*  I like Candace a lot, but Candace says a lot of wild shit. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7140.66s)]
*  She does. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7143.38s)]
*  It's not accurate. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7143.86s)]
*  Like, she thinks dinosaurs are fake. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7144.82s)]
*  I hear you. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7146.66s)]
*  I get it. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7148.26s)]
*  That is like self-inflicted. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7150.82s)]
*  That's a self-inflicted wound. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7152.9s)]
*  But do you think that I'm like, are you a Holocaust denier? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7154.5s)]
*  No, I'm not a Holocaust denier. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7158.58s)]
*  And it's still to this day. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7160.34s)]
*  She's a Holocaust denier. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7161.3s)]
*  Well, that's my friend Darrell Cooper who was on my podcast, you know, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7162.58s)]
*  because he said hyperbolically that Winston Churchill was one of the main villains of World [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7165.94s)]
*  War II because he started blockades and forced Hitler into action and starved the German people. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7174.58s)]
*  Like, it's like what he said was really unfortunate the way he said it the way he said it. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7182.1s)]
*  But he was trying to say that Winston Churchill did some things that if he hadn't done them, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7186.9s)]
*  World War II wouldn't have gone the way it went. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7193.0599999999995s)]
*  But the problem is when you say that and it gets taken out of context, people say, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7195.78s)]
*  oh, he's a Holocaust denier, a Nazi sympathizer. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7198.74s)]
*  But then you listen to his podcast. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7202.98s)]
*  He's got this like, I think it's like 30 hours called Fear and Loathing in New Jerusalem. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7204.34s)]
*  And it's the most gut-wrenching tale of the persecution of Jews in Eastern Europe. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7209.38s)]
*  Just the beginning of it. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7215.86s)]
*  I tell everybody, just listen to the first like 40 minutes of it. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7216.58s)]
*  It's so heartbreaking. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7219.54s)]
*  This is not the words of a homophobe or excuse me, of an anti-Semite that would say those things. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7221.7s)]
*  Reductionist things that people love to do. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7228.34s)]
*  But even still, here would be my argument to that. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7231.3s)]
*  Let's say he was. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7234.66s)]
*  If you're inclined to believe that, let's say that was his argument and that Hitler wasn't bad and [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7237.7s)]
*  it was Churchill, then you're an asshole and an idiot. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7243.78s)]
*  Then there's no hope for you. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7247.860000000001s)]
*  This gatekeeping of information. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7249.86s)]
*  But he's neither an asshole or an idiot. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7251.06s)]
*  And he's being called an asshole and an idiot by people who don't consume his work. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7253.3s)]
*  Of course. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7257.3s)]
*  I'm saying worst case scenario. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7257.9400000000005s)]
*  Because I see this a lot with the gatekeeping of information. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7260.26s)]
*  And God forbid you don't fact check everybody on everything. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7263.46s)]
*  Which has been something that I've gotten a bit of. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7266.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, well, you nodded your head and you said I see your point. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7268.900000000001s)]
*  I'm like, well, sometimes I see their point. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7271.3s)]
*  And sometimes I don't know. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7272.82s)]
*  And I can't fact check everything. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7274.02s)]
*  And I'll talk to somebody else who has a differing opinion. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7275.46s)]
*  But people can think for themselves as well. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7277.94s)]
*  There's just a lot of bad faith actors out there. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7282.179999999999s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that do that. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7285.299999999999s)]
*  This taking people out of context and trying to use this reductionist perspective and label people [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7287.46s)]
*  with these pejoratives that are inescapable. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7292.74s)]
*  Like, it's the racist, homophobe, anti-Semite, all those. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7294.98s)]
*  Those are inescapable. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7300.179999999999s)]
*  And once you get hit with those, that's your fucking sticker on your forehead for the rest of your life. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7301.299999999999s)]
*  And that's what they're trying to do to you. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7307.38s)]
*  Because they're trying to silence you. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7309.3s)]
*  Because they want to win. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7311.78s)]
*  And this is a real problem with human beings when it comes to ideas. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7312.82s)]
*  Is that if I believe something and you believe something differently, [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7316.179999999999s)]
*  I don't want to listen to you. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7319.62s)]
*  I want to beat you. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7321.0599999999995s)]
*  I want to overwhelm you with talk. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7322.9s)]
*  I want to pierce Morgan you into submission. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7325.0599999999995s)]
*  I want to yell at you. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7327.62s)]
*  Not pierce the human, but the show. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7328.58s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7330.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7331.46s)]
*  You want to yell at them. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7331.78s)]
*  And you want to win. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7332.9s)]
*  You want to dunk on them. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7334.179999999999s)]
*  And this is why I don't engage with people on social media. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7335.54s)]
*  I just think it's the worst way to communicate. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7338.34s)]
*  And when I see people doing it, I genuinely feel bad for them because I think they're mentally ill. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7340.5s)]
*  When people are dunking on people constantly on social media, I'm like, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7345.06s)]
*  well, that's a sign of mental illness. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7348.42s)]
*  There's something wrong with you. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7350.9s)]
*  But you don't realize that yet. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7351.94s)]
*  This shit's been around for 20 years now. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7354.82s)]
*  And you're still engaging in that kind of behavior on social media? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7357.06s)]
*  It's stupid. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7360.82s)]
*  It gets clicks. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7361.7s)]
*  That's what I think it is. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7363.7s)]
*  That's also part of the problem. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7364.9s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7365.94s)]
*  I get enough attention. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7366.099999999999s)]
*  I get enough attention so I don't need to reach out and try to get more. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7367.78s)]
*  By the way, that's what you're supposed to do when you get a lot of attention. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7372.5s)]
*  You're supposed to rise above with great power, great responsibility. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7374.98s)]
*  You're supposed to try to be nicer. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7379.139999999999s)]
*  What are my core tenets in life? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7381.62s)]
*  Be as nice as possible. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7383.62s)]
*  And here's the shocker. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7385.0599999999995s)]
*  I find people are nice to me almost entirely. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7386.66s)]
*  Very rarely are people not nice to me because I'm nice to everybody. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7391.78s)]
*  If you're nice to everybody, guess what? [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7395.219999999999s)]
*  People are nice to you. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7397.7s)]
*  And even people I disagree with. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7398.74s)]
*  Disagree with fundamentally. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7402.099999999999s)]
*  But you're listening to them though. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7403.86s)]
*  That's exactly what you're trying to say. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7405.7s)]
*  One of the conversations I've referred to a couple of times is the one I had with Matt Walsh. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7408.259999999999s)]
*  There's no universe so I'm going to change Matt Walsh's mind about gay marriage. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7414.0199999999995s)]
*  But at least I want to understand them. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7418.259999999999s)]
*  And I also am hoping that some people who are in the middle of this argument and could be influenced [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7422.0199999999995s)]
*  might go my way. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7428.42s)]
*  I cannot remember if this was a TED talk or where this information or this story was put out in the [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7430.34s)]
*  world. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7435.78s)]
*  But it was the story of a black man who ended up befriending a grand wizard of the clan. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7436.1s)]
*  Daryl Davis. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7443.14s)]
*  He's a friend of ours. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7444.26s)]
*  He's been on the podcast a couple of times. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7444.98s)]
*  Daryl's a musician. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7448.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7449.38s)]
*  And became the guy's godfather, the guy's kids? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7450.820000000001s)]
*  Not just one. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7453.38s)]
*  No, he's got more than a hundred of these KKK guys to give him their robes. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7454.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7461.780000000001s)]
*  And convert and change them over. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7462.26s)]
*  That's what I want. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7464.18s)]
*  Just by love. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7465.14s)]
*  Just with love. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7466.18s)]
*  That's what I'm hoping. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7466.9800000000005s)]
*  In those conversations, that's power. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7468.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7470.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, Daryl's a really amazing person. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7471.46s)]
*  A shining example of what's possible. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7474.42s)]
*  When you just show people. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7476.34s)]
*  Like he's like, man, you're different than all the others. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7477.780000000001s)]
*  Actually, I'm just a human. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7480.0199999999995s)]
*  I just have more melanin in my skin. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7482.179999999999s)]
*  And you are unfortunately, you have been trapped by an ideology. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7484.34s)]
*  You have other people simply by their looks. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7488.82s)]
*  And you haven't learned this lesson that we were supposed to be taught by Dr. King in [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7492.98s)]
*  the 1960s. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7496.82s)]
*  Judge a man by the content of the character. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7498.179999999999s)]
*  It must have been your show actually where I heard it. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7500.34s)]
*  But it changed the way that I approach 99% of my conversations. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7502.5s)]
*  I thought, OK, if I listen with an intent to hear and an intent to understand and I [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7510.179999999999s)]
*  can expose people to the things they're uncomfortable with in a way where we find common ground, [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7516.66s)]
*  I may not change their mind, but at least you're in some cases you hopefully can. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7522.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7527.54s)]
*  And at least you're modeling. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7527.86s)]
*  But it takes so much time. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7529.94s)]
*  It's like Indiana Jones, when the guy starts throwing the whip and he just pulls the gun [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7532.74s)]
*  out and just shoots him. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7538.66s)]
*  It's like, I just want to shut the fuck up. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7540.099999999999s)]
*  That's what a lot of people like, especially today in this like everybody wants to take [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7543.22s)]
*  a Zempik. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7546.98s)]
*  You want a quick fix. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7547.54s)]
*  You don't work out for fucking six years to lose 50 pounds. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7548.26s)]
*  No, I want to just lose 50 pounds in a month. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7551.46s)]
*  And this is the quick fix thing of today's society. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7554.34s)]
*  And when you're offered this pill that makes you smarter instead of reading books, like, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7558.18s)]
*  yeah, I'll take that pill. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7563.22s)]
*  You know, like this is the argument that I've said to people when they always talk about, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7564.900000000001s)]
*  you know, I don't have time for exercise. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7569.3s)]
*  Like, I'm not interested in my body. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7571.3s)]
*  Like, this is stupid. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7573.06s)]
*  It's vain. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7574.26s)]
*  It's just not. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7574.74s)]
*  I'm like, listen, if I gave you a pill, just give you a pill and that pill made you fit [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7575.22s)]
*  and healthy and muscular. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7580.58s)]
*  You wouldn't take that pill? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7581.7s)]
*  Improved your self-confidence. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7582.66s)]
*  Why would you not want a body that works way better? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7583.14s)]
*  Improved your mood. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7585.7s)]
*  Yeah, of course you would. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7587.22s)]
*  Your sex life would get better. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7588.18s)]
*  All of those things. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7590.02s)]
*  Of course you'd take it. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7590.66s)]
*  That's a defense mechanism, though. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7591.3s)]
*  You know that. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7592.74s)]
*  It's a fear that they would be incapable of following through on what's required. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7594.259999999999s)]
*  So they defend against it. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7599.299999999999s)]
*  It's the same shit you see with the people that are overweight and like, I don't care. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7600.66s)]
*  Or they make fun of their weight and like they become the funny fat guy. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7604.82s)]
*  It's a defense mechanism. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7608.74s)]
*  Oh, I have a lot of friends like that. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7609.7s)]
*  A lot of comedians. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7610.9s)]
*  It's like their entire act, like being fat. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7611.78s)]
*  I know. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7614.58s)]
*  Big part of it. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7614.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7615.78s)]
*  There was a guy, I went to kill Tony last night and there was a comedian that was up first. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7616.099999999999s)]
*  And he was 412 pounds. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7620.82s)]
*  The guys were doing what they obviously do. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7622.66s)]
*  But there was a part of my heart that was splitting. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7625.14s)]
*  Of course. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7628.9800000000005s)]
*  Because I was like, deep down, he's hurting. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7629.46s)]
*  Deep down, this fucking guy's hurting. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7631.46s)]
*  Deep down, it's not funny. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7633.06s)]
*  I know, right? [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7634.34s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7635.54s)]
*  I was dying. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7636.18s)]
*  I was dying inside for him. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7637.3s)]
*  Also, if you're 420 pounds or whatever he is, like boy, the road to becoming healthy is [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7639.14s)]
*  hundreds of pounds away. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7645.46s)]
*  And that is so daunting. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7647.14s)]
*  Especially when you have the pull of addiction. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7649.14s)]
*  And that's the big problem. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7652.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7653.860000000001s)]
*  And then you get eat intuitively. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7654.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7656.820000000001s)]
*  Which is impossible, by the way. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7657.700000000001s)]
*  Because the food is designed to override your satiety. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7659.46s)]
*  If I eat intuitively, I eat only pizza. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7662.5s)]
*  I have some french fries in there. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7668.740000000001s)]
*  I think some fries. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7670.34s)]
*  That's 100%. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7671.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7671.780000000001s)]
*  Pizza, fries, and ice cream. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7672.02s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7674.660000000001s)]
*  And Coca-Cola would be my whole diet. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7674.9800000000005s)]
*  But the whole, the entire food system. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7676.900000000001s)]
*  All of the ultra processed foods is designed to override your body's signaling of satiety. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7680.26s)]
*  It's fucking impossible. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7687.860000000001s)]
*  And then you couple that with the psychological vulnerabilities and it's a powder keg. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7689.780000000001s)]
*  You sound like an Afro-Zempik. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7695.14s)]
*  That's exactly what I am. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7697.7s)]
*  Oh my god, I'm going to get that tattoo, man. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7699.62s)]
*  Afro-Zempik dragon believer. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7702.26s)]
*  All of the night. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7703.860000000001s)]
*  I got the sticker, by the way. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7704.900000000001s)]
*  It's on my suitcase. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7706.58s)]
*  Fuck yeah, I like that. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7708.18s)]
*  Afro-Zempik. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7709.06s)]
*  It's really kooky. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7710.58s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7712.34s)]
*  But the only way out is through conversations. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7712.900000000001s)]
*  The only way out is to educate people or enlighten people or expose people to other ideas. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7716.9800000000005s)]
*  You're not really going to educate them, but you will expose them to other ideas. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7723.3s)]
*  And I think over time, the good ideas will win. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7726.18s)]
*  It's just it's been so many years of bad ideas. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7730.5s)]
*  And it's so indoctrinating. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7734.5s)]
*  And it's so difficult. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7736.820000000001s)]
*  And then also it's your identity. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7737.7s)]
*  Your identity is just whatever it is, whether you're Matt Walsh or whether you're a 420 pound [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7739.06s)]
*  trans person, your identity is embedded in whatever you think of yourself as being. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7744.820000000001s)]
*  And it's very difficult to take wisdom from someone that you think of as the enemy. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7750.580000000001s)]
*  That's so true. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7754.580000000001s)]
*  And breaking that identity, in particular when it works against someone. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7755.620000000001s)]
*  So one of the things that people can't believe in a reality they haven't experienced. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7760.740000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7765.46s)]
*  And so one of the ways that I used to utilize fitness was to give them an experience that [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7766.1s)]
*  they didn't think they were capable of. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7773.06s)]
*  So all of a sudden you've got the funny fat guy who just ran that mile without stopping. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7774.5s)]
*  Or who just did the push up on the hands and the feet or just did 10 pull ups in a row or even two. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7779.22s)]
*  But once they look at their achievement, it's like, holy shit. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7784.5s)]
*  I didn't know I was capable of this. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7789.700000000001s)]
*  And then you shatter that prison of limiting beliefs and you open up an infinity of possibility. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7791.62s)]
*  You also have to find a tribe. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7797.7s)]
*  You have to surround yourself with other people that are trying to prove themselves. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7800.34s)]
*  So if other people around you are trying to improve themselves, then it will encourage [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7803.78s)]
*  you to be a part of that group and you all do it together. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7807.46s)]
*  Completely. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7810.1s)]
*  And then help each other if you fall off the wagon and pick each other up and like [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7810.74s)]
*  reinforce positive behavior. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7814.98s)]
*  You see all of that with, you know, back in the day, I used to get so caught up in the fights [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7817.94s)]
*  about diets and fat diets and fat workouts. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7822.179999999999s)]
*  And as I've matured or like to think that I have matured, I don't even engage in that shit anymore. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7825.54s)]
*  It really doesn't matter what workout you're doing. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7831.78s)]
*  If you're doing it with a qualified professional or if it's if people are showing up for CrossFit [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7834.259999999999s)]
*  because they love CrossFit and they love the community, great. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7840.5s)]
*  If they're showing up for Pilates because they love the community and they're showing up for it, [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7842.74s)]
*  great. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7846.419999999999s)]
*  As long as they're showing up for something and the person teaching them a great CrossFit coach [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7846.98s)]
*  matters. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7853.299999999999s)]
*  That's a big difference between you herniating three discs and getting into the best shape of [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7854.74s)]
*  your life. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7859.299999999999s)]
*  So I would simply say look for a qualified expert. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7859.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7862.419999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm I'm beyond the what's the best diet and what's the best who gives a fuck as long as [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7863.62s)]
*  you're is your if you're in a positive environment that's getting you to show up for it day after day [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7869.94s)]
*  something's better than nothing. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7876.66s)]
*  And you're focusing on improving. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7877.86s)]
*  Yes. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7879.78s)]
*  And that comes with community. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7880.74s)]
*  That's what people love about CrossFit is the whole community of people. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7883.38s)]
*  You go there, you're all working out together. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7886.5s)]
*  I used to love that about yoga class. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7888.0199999999995s)]
*  Go to a bunch of people. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7890.179999999999s)]
*  I knew them all like, hey, what's up? [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7891.3s)]
*  You know, but you don't talk until after it's over. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7895.22s)]
*  It's one of those things like you're really discouraged talking before but like you're all [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7897.139999999999s)]
*  sweating together. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7901.7s)]
*  Like you're going through it together. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7902.58s)]
*  There's no other way, you know, and then you get out the other end. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7904.26s)]
*  You're like, wow, I wouldn't have done that by myself. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7907.54s)]
*  I would have quit at like 40 minutes, but I did the whole 90 minutes and now I feel better. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7909.38s)]
*  And then the rest of the day is easy. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7914.1s)]
*  That's why I think community is such an integral part of treating addiction because you have that [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7915.860000000001s)]
*  supportive group to keep you accountable, to show up, to feel like you're a part of something. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7923.06s)]
*  And we've seen it work for you and work against you. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7927.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it's also an integral part for an evil army. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7929.54s)]
*  Unfortunately, you have to believe that you have to kill these heretics. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7934.1s)]
*  How do we tip things over to make your side be more attractive? [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7943.9400000000005s)]
*  You have to make your side kinder and more empathetic and also more admirable. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7948.34s)]
*  Yes, you're right. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7954.26s)]
*  The rewards have to be there and admirable is one. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7956.26s)]
*  Yeah, you have to like wish you had those characteristics and go, why don't I? [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7959.3s)]
*  Maybe I can, you know, and just also realize you're not who you used to be. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7964.42s)]
*  Okay, if you were a fat alcoholic gambling addict, you don't have to stay that way forever. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7969.780000000001s)]
*  You just you don't have to. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7975.700000000001s)]

*  You are trapped with behavior and ideas that were not self-serving. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7979.06s)]
*  They're not good for people around you. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7983.14s)]
*  You probably stole things to feed your addictions and you feel you have terrible self-worth and [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7985.14s)]
*  terrible self-image, but that's not you. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7991.38s)]
*  That's who you have been. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7994.5s)]
*  You are who you are right now. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7996.02s)]
*  So if you choose right now to be positive from here on out and you're going to have [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=7998.5s)]
*  some mistakes and fuck up along the way, but find a group. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8003.22s)]
*  This is why Alcoholics Anonymous is so important. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8005.860000000001s)]
*  You get around these people and you all agree. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8008.580000000001s)]
*  They're all like and you have sponsors and you help each other. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8011.22s)]
*  Like this is the whole idea of community. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8014.42s)]
*  We are not solitary individuals. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8016.58s)]
*  We're just not. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8019.22s)]
*  We are a collective organism experiencing itself in individual ways. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8020.5s)]
*  I agree with you. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8027.3s)]
*  I do. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8028.42s)]
*  I just I want I sometimes see evil winning out more often than not. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8029.46s)]
*  Well, because that's what's in the news and that's also what's in your algorithm, [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8035.54s)]
*  you know, and that's why you have to stay off social media. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8038.74s)]
*  You're. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8040.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8043.38s)]
*  I feel so much better. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8044.42s)]
*  I've been off social media like almost entirely for like a few. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8045.46s)]
*  I don't like really weaned off about two weeks ago. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8050.18s)]
*  I really followed my wife's footsteps because like she just got off and she's like, [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8054.9800000000005s)]
*  I feel so much better. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8058.74s)]
*  I'm like, damn, that's crazy. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8059.54s)]
*  And so I'm like, let me try it. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8061.54s)]
*  And so I tried it for a day. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8062.9800000000005s)]
*  I was like, wow, I feel so much better after this day. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8064.02s)]
*  And then I tried a couple of days and then I'm like, oh, it's real. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8066.42s)]
*  Like there's, you know, sugar Sean O'Malley, UFC champion. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8070.58s)]
*  He said he goes, I get a low level anxiety when I'm scrolling through social media. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8074.5s)]
*  I'm like, right. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8079.7s)]
*  What is that? [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8080.74s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8081.62s)]
*  But that shit's real. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8082.66s)]
*  It's also you realize like you're just distracting yourself with this stupidity. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8084.1s)]
*  That's but when you don't freaking show. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8087.38s)]
*  But when you don't do that, your mind feels better. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8089.9400000000005s)]
*  It really does feel better. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8092.82s)]
*  So I will occasionally like I'm on the toilet. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8094.58s)]
*  I like scroll through Twitter, find out what is everybody mad at. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8097.46s)]
*  And then I'll put it away, you know, and then sometimes I'll go days [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8100.74s)]
*  without looking at it at all. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8103.94s)]
*  And then sometimes like, hey, like I got a text the other day like, hey, man, are you okay? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8105.46s)]
*  I was like, well, what? [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8109.62s)]
*  And they're like, oh, people are mad at you on Twitter. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8110.74s)]
*  I'm like, okay, that's not the real world, bro. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8112.419999999999s)]
*  I don't even know what they're mad at. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8114.82s)]
*  Like, no, don't reach like a friend of mine sent me something that people are. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8116.339999999999s)]
*  I go, don't send me that shit. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8119.94s)]
*  I'm not looking at it. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8121.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8121.94s)]
*  Aren't you immune to that by now though? [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8122.5s)]
*  You have been forged in fire. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8124.98s)]
*  Fuck's sake. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8128.419999999999s)]
*  What are they going to say to you at this point that you're even going to care about? [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8129.219999999999s)]
*  The thing is, it's not me. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8131.94s)]
*  It's them. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8133.3s)]
*  They think that I'm upset at this thing because they would be upset at this thing [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8134.26s)]
*  because they don't get attacked. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8138.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8139.860000000001s)]
*  So like my sister used to send me things like that. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8140.18s)]
*  I'm like, don't send me that shit. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8142.02s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8143.7s)]
*  Like, you know, I know my wife used to do that for a little while because she would worry [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8144.42s)]
*  and want me to kind of like temper my behavior. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8148.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8150.900000000001s)]
*  My business partner would do the same thing like, oh, I really know. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8151.46s)]
*  Could you just stay in the pocket here on the fitness stuff? [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8154.1s)]
*  But I found that the more I would lean into that, it didn't matter how many attacks would [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8158.98s)]
*  come my way because you would resonate with the people that got it. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8167.139999999999s)]
*  And that ended up working better for me personally and professionally. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8171.0599999999995s)]
*  But you're right. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8174.5s)]
*  It is their concern of how they would feel if people called them those things or came [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8175.7s)]
*  for them with the pitchforks and torches. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8180.0199999999995s)]
*  By the way, the worst thing you could do is fight back, which is really crazy. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8181.78s)]
*  The worst thing you can do is like interact with people that are attacking you. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8185.219999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8187.78s)]
*  Which is really kind of, but that's everyone's instinct. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8188.74s)]
*  Everyone's instinct is to go, well, I'll tell you what I think now. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8191.22s)]
*  You get caught up in it. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8195.38s)]
*  Yeah, you get caught up in it. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8196.74s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8197.38s)]
*  The only time I find myself doing that these days and I'm going to stop it [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8198.66s)]
*  is when my son will challenge me on something and then my mother is like, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8202.26s)]
*  we're debating something. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8206.58s)]
*  She's like, honey, you're litigating this with a 13-year-old. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8207.539999999999s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, OK. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8211.94s)]
*  And you know why? [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8214.5s)]
*  Because I still care what my kids think about me. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8215.14s)]
*  Instead of you, but the rest of the world, I don't give a fuck. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8218.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8221.62s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8221.94s)]
*  Well, you do, but also you can't control what people think. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8223.38s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8227.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8228.18s)]
*  The only thing you could do is be undeniable. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8228.5s)]
*  That's so well said. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8231.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8233.7s)]
*  That is so well said. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8233.94s)]
*  That's all you have. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8235.06s)]
*  And so what happens with haters is they challenge you to become more undeniable. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8235.78s)]
*  And so that's good. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8240.5s)]
*  That's what their job is. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8241.38s)]
*  They make you steal many arguments. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8242.66s)]
*  All the losers of the world, they challenge you to become a bigger winner. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8243.46s)]
*  They really do. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8247.86s)]
*  I've learned how, especially in the health space, when I would [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8249.300000000001s)]
*  be active in a conversation about fitness or nutrition or what have you, [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8254.1s)]
*  you learn how to bulletproof yourself in that conversation. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8258.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8261.94s)]
*  Because people will fight so hard to keep their bad habits. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8262.18s)]
*  God, it is insane. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8266.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8268.66s)]
*  And there's also so much infighting in every industry, which bombs me out. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8269.140000000001s)]
*  And that's when I just was like, what am I doing? [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8273.060000000001s)]
*  That's an attention thing, right? [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8275.220000000001s)]
*  They're upset that you're getting the attention that they think they deserve. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8276.58s)]
*  She doesn't even know what the fuck she's talking about. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8280.1s)]
*  Like, blah, blah, blah. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8281.86s)]
*  But you know what's... [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8282.9s)]
*  You see a lot of that in the health space. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8283.38s)]
*  You do, and I hate it. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8284.74s)]
*  And it's super disappointing because we can share ideas and we can, as you said, [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8286.02s)]
*  admit when we're wrong and learn and grow and what have you. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8293.3s)]
*  But the real enemy is not another frigging doctor or another PhD with a different opinion. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8297.14s)]
*  We've seen who the real enemy is. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8303.7s)]
*  And it's big pharma when it's got bad intentions or big food with bad intentions or big ag. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8305.38s)]
*  It's not going to be like the guy who has a different opinion on cholesterol. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8311.619999999999s)]
*  For fuck's sake. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8316.179999999998s)]
*  It's not even... [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8317.539999999999s)]
*  It's just that that guy with a different opinion on cholesterol is getting a lot of attention. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8318.66s)]
*  And then these people are comparing them. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8322.5s)]
*  They're comparing themselves to that person. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8324.82s)]
*  Why don't I get this attention? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8326.74s)]
*  And the way to get the attention is to dunk on that person, to say awful things. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8328.82s)]
*  And then people dunk on you. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8333.14s)]
*  And then now your life is conflict. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8334.5s)]
*  Okay. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8336.9s)]
*  Good job. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8337.7s)]
*  When they do, I like to sit down and see if there's truth there, like you said. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8338.9s)]
*  I've not been immune to some of Lane Norton's assaults. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8345.62s)]
*  And you know what? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8349.38s)]
*  We sat down and I was like, listen, Lane, the things you're going after me on are not from me. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8351.3s)]
*  It's from this PhD, that PhD, this PhD, and the American Medical Association. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8355.62s)]
*  And I had him on my podcast. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8359.7s)]
*  By the time we were done, he won me over. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8362.26s)]
*  I was like, I believe you. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8364.58s)]
*  I think you're right. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8366.74s)]
*  I'm changing my position on this. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8367.380000000001s)]
*  Sometimes, you're right, it's because someone is getting attention or there's envy there. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8371.380000000001s)]
*  And I would simply say you can intuit when a criticism might be legitimate. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8377.220000000001s)]
*  And when you're seeing it over and over and over again, and it's a similar thing, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8381.94s)]
*  there's something to look at there. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8386.1s)]
*  But outside of that, when you know it's bullshit... [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8387.78s)]
*  There's also the problem with bots. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8389.94s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8392.74s)]
*  The vast majority of Twitter might be bots. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8393.380000000001s)]
*  An FBI analyst that used to analyze big data sets, he looked at Twitter and he said, [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8397.460000000001s)]
*  it might be about 80% bots. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8405.140000000001s)]
*  Kara Swisher said that to me. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8407.060000000001s)]
*  I was blown away. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8408.9s)]
*  No, Kirsten it is. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8410.1s)]
*  And she would know. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8412.5s)]
*  And she was showing me stuff, bot farms and shit all along the wall. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8413.94s)]
*  Yeah, and then you're just engaging with the machine. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8418.82s)]
*  They shape narratives. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8423.3s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8424.74s)]
*  Rogue states and different people use it. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8425.7s)]
*  And I'm sure there's publicity firms that use it, I'm sure. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8428.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8433.22s)]
*  I don't either, but without question. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8434.74s)]
*  But you could use it with AI. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8435.86s)]
*  You could easily have one computer that would run many, many accounts. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8438.34s)]
*  And you could program it to have variations on a theme. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8444.34s)]
*  But you see it sometimes when there's a lot of social media influencers that get co-opted. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8447.54s)]
*  And one of the things that you see is a very similar message. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8454.740000000002s)]
*  And they use very similar phrasing. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8458.740000000002s)]
*  Sharp as attack was one of them. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8461.220000000001s)]
*  And you saw that over and over again with Biden. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8462.900000000001s)]
*  Like sharp as attack. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8465.300000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8466.18s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8467.300000000001s)]
*  So they were getting influenced and they were getting paid. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8468.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8470.740000000002s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8472.34s)]
*  I'm sure, of course you would have. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8473.220000000001s)]
*  But I remember when I was talking to Senator Johnson and he was exposing me to the Trusted [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8474.82s)]
*  News Initiative. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8480.58s)]
*  And this is the whole, the newscasters that have the exact same script and say the exact same thing. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8482.1s)]
*  But in freaking broad daylight, there's guys, we have clips of all of you saying the exact same thing. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8489.699999999999s)]
*  It's so clear. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8499.38s)]
*  It's a narrative. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8500.34s)]
*  And when he told me, he was, God, this was, this blew my mind. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8501.54s)]
*  He went pre-COVID to, he was talking about this event at the Milken Institute where Fauci and I, [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8506.580000000002s)]
*  oh my God, I'm gonna screw this up. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8515.86s)]
*  But I think it's this guy Rick Bright. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8517.060000000001s)]
*  Forgive me because this may be wrong. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8518.660000000002s)]
*  But the group of people, definitely Fauci, were talking about what it would take to get a global [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8520.18s)]
*  vaccine program. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8526.02s)]
*  Fauci says probably going to take a pandemic. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8527.220000000001s)]
*  And this is like five months before COVID. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8528.9s)]
*  Just put my tin hat on and roll myself in tin foil and jump all the way down the rabbit hole. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8534.26s)]
*  But then Averill Haynes said, well, what are we going to do about misinformation at this event [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8539.46s)]
*  that she put on shortly after that? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8544.5s)]
*  And he said that's where they came up with the Trusted News Initiative right in time. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8546.34s)]
*  They came up with a new term and that term is malinformation. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8552.1s)]
*  Do you know what malinformation is? [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8556.5s)]
*  Malinformation is true information that might do harm. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8558.34s)]
*  Did not know this. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8562.42s)]
*  So there's misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8563.460000000001s)]
*  I have not heard that. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8569.060000000001s)]
*  Malinformation was something they were trying to promote during the Biden [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8570.42s)]
*  administration as being dangerous. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8572.980000000001s)]
*  And it's essentially the truth. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8574.5s)]
*  I knew the, we've got to reconsider the First Amendment. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8576.900000000001s)]
*  I've seen all those clips of, that is some scary shit. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8581.460000000001s)]
*  Senator Kerry, Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, and do we criminalize people who are promoting this [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8585.699999999999s)]
*  misinformation? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8593.06s)]
*  But I did not hear malinformation. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8593.779999999999s)]
*  Did you ever see the CEO of NPR doing a Ted Talk saying that sometimes the truth gets in the way of [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8594.98s)]
*  getting things done? [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8601.3s)]
*  Oh, God, no. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8602.179999999998s)]
*  But I heard, I've heard them all say that. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8603.38s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8607.859999999999s)]
*  It's an infantilization, infantilization of the public because they're too stupid to [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8609.14s)]
*  handle the truth. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8615.14s)]
*  They're dumber than you. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8615.939999999999s)]
*  You, you're the purveyor of information and you need to give them the information that [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8616.9s)]
*  gets things done. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8622.58s)]
*  And sometimes you have to lie to them. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8623.779999999999s)]
*  Like vaccines are safe and effective. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8625.539999999999s)]
*  You, oh my God, what did you post? [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8627.779999999999s)]
*  I think it was the cover of the New Yorker that said something about doing away with [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8629.699999999999s)]
*  the First Amendment. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8633.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8634.66s)]
*  And I... [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8635.699999999999s)]
*  Wonderful idea. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8636.18s)]
*  I... [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8637.3s)]
*  Wait, what the fuck are you talking about? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8641.14s)]
*  It's not like a number 14, by the way, or number five is a number one. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8644.5s)]
*  The First Amendment. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8650.02s)]
*  It's in the way. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8653.380000000001s)]
*  It's in the way. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8654.18s)]
*  That, to me, when you're having this debate about Kamala versus Trump, I'm like, how do [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8655.060000000001s)]
*  you guys have this selective outrage about what's flipping your shit? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8664.18s)]
*  I want to process for Kilmour and Braco Garcia, who, you know, probably beats his wife and [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8668.9s)]
*  is a suspect. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8677.14s)]
*  I get it. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8677.86s)]
*  I want to do... [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8678.42s)]
*  Seems like he's got MS-13 tattooed on his knuckles. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8678.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8681.7s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8682.26s)]
*  And there was a deportation order. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8682.98s)]
*  Just say it. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8685.38s)]
*  Like, so you can't... [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8685.94s)]
*  You see the photographs that his wife puts out where she covers his knuckles in every [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8686.58s)]
*  picture? [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8690.26s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8690.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8691.22s)]
*  Yes. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8691.86s)]
*  Hilarious. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8692.5s)]
*  I mean... [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8693.14s)]
*  So I was saying, oh my God, they deported a Maryland man and a father, because that's [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8693.86s)]
*  what I was reading the news. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8697.7s)]
*  Same. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8698.66s)]
*  And then you get into it and you're like, oh, wait a minute. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8699.220000000001s)]
*  Oh, hold on. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8701.7s)]
*  And then they released the dashcam footage, the police footage of when they arrested him. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8702.42s)]
*  Not dashcam. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8708.740000000002s)]
*  You know, whatever the cops are wearing. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8709.54s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8711.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8711.86s)]
*  I thought the exact same thing. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8712.26s)]
*  It's crazy, but it's just like, you can't just go on narratives because these narratives [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8714.820000000002s)]
*  are just designed to make the Trump administration look like monsters. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8720.58s)]
*  I was giving an interview to this woman from the New York Times and she's like, but don't [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8724.26s)]
*  you see this? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8728.820000000002s)]
*  And I was like, I do see it and I don't understand it and I wish it would be different, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8729.300000000001s)]
*  but then you get into the lesser evils. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8733.300000000001s)]
*  I wrote her back and I was like, I don't agree with my previous position based on the current [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8734.980000000001s)]
*  information available to me now. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8739.94s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like he was a gang member. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8742.02s)]
*  But then there was that gay hairdresser that seems like he just got roped up. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8743.86s)]
*  I know. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8747.94s)]
*  And what I have learned so far, because I've really been trying to get to the bottom of [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8748.580000000002s)]
*  that one because I don't understand why the left isn't leaning on that one. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8752.42s)]
*  The other guy beats his wife, suspected trafficker. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8755.78s)]
*  You want to be outraged. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8759.06s)]
*  This guy is a gay hairdresser. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8760.74s)]
*  I guess he committed, I was listening to Tim Poole talk about this, immigration fraud. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8762.02s)]
*  So listen, that guy's a tough one. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8768.66s)]
*  He doesn't belong in an El Salvador prison. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8771.54s)]
*  I agree with you completely. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8773.460000000001s)]
*  Also, he's not even from El Salvador, which is really crazy. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8774.66s)]
*  Now, okay, hold on. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8777.460000000001s)]
*  Here would be the argument there. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8778.66s)]
*  I think if I'm understanding it correctly is that if somebody can be deported, but they [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8781.939999999999s)]
*  are withheld because of asylum, correct me if I'm wrong here, because they worry going [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8789.3s)]
*  back to their home country is dangerous or deadly like Killmore or Brego Garcia, because [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8794.34s)]
*  he's not a gang member, but he's afraid of being killed by other gangs that aren't MS-13. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8800.179999999998s)]
*  You caught that one, right? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8804.98s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8806.099999999999s)]
*  So it's like, I can't go home because the other gangs will kill me, but I'm not a gang [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8806.58s)]
*  member. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8810.9s)]
*  Nevertheless, there's a deportation order on him, so I believe that they can just send [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8811.38s)]
*  him to a third country, and that's not illegal. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8815.859999999999s)]
*  That's something I heard. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8819.539999999999s)]
*  Okay, but just violating immigration fraud when you're a gay hairdresser. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8820.58s)]
*  You don't throw him in a fucking concentration camp. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8826.18s)]
*  You could not be more right about that, but tell me then why is the left not hanging there? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8827.539999999999s)]
*  Why is he not the poster child, that guy? [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8833.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's his knuckles. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8835.859999999999s)]
*  People don't agree that that's what that means. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8838.5s)]
*  Oh, dude, I've talked to a guy who's a gang expert. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8840.66s)]
*  Two separate courts agreed. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8845.3s)]
*  I talked to a guy who's a gang expert to explain it to me. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8846.74s)]
*  He's like, yeah, this is how it works. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8849.539999999999s)]
*  There's also an informant who confirmed that he's... [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8850.9s)]
*  Well, there's different versions of MS-13, but that's what it means. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8852.98s)]
*  Like marijuana, smiley face, Jesus, and then the skull. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8856.18s)]
*  I'm just saying when I've looked online... [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8862.26s)]
*  How is this the left poster child, though? [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8863.86s)]
*  Okay, you can look online, but I mean, I talked to a gang expert that told me that [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8866.26s)]
*  it was explaining to me, and there's a bunch of different versions of gang tattoos. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8869.86s)]
*  There's two courts that determined he was an MS-13 gang member. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8872.980000000001s)]
*  The cops had an informant that was an extremely reliable source that said he is MS-13. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8878.74s)]
*  The guy, the wife was like, he beats me, and then withdrew, I guess, but had filed a report. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8885.220000000001s)]
*  He had a protection order in 2021. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8891.94s)]
*  The cops pulled the guy over with eight guys in the car going from Texas to Maryland, I think, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8893.7s)]
*  or from Maryland to Texas, no luggage, no tools, and suspected him of trafficking. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8898.74s)]
*  Again, I will simply say, if your... [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8905.46s)]
*  Didn't apply for a... [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8908.1s)]
*  Why are they hanging their hat on this one and not the gay hairdresser? [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8908.9s)]
*  I'm asking you that. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8911.46s)]
*  Would that be your sacrificial lamb? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8913.619999999999s)]
*  Because I heard Glenn Greenwald talk about the gay hairdresser, [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8916.1s)]
*  and that one seems the most compelling. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8919.06s)]
*  I agree completely. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8920.74s)]
*  But there's no logic in this world anymore. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8922.02s)]
*  I... [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8924.02s)]
*  It's all kooky. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8924.5s)]
*  Like whatever gets traction, you know? [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8925.539999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's because he's got kids. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8928.34s)]
*  Oh, it's a father, Maryland father. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8929.62s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8932.26s)]
*  I keep saying wrongly deported Maryland father. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8933.380000000001s)]
*  Wrongly why? [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8936.66s)]
*  Tell me what's wrong about it. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8938.02s)]
*  He had a deportation order, 100%, and then said, I am worried that the other gangs will kill me. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8939.460000000001s)]
*  And so that's when they withheld the deportation order. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8949.06s)]
*  But he can be deported to another country, legally. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8953.3s)]
*  That's the part that if he's not a gang member, [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8956.5s)]
*  why is he worried about being killed by other gangs? [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8959.14s)]
*  I would just... [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8961.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8962.26s)]
*  Like this is a common sense piece that we... [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8962.5s)]
*  The whole thing's kooky. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8966.02s)]
*  I'd hang my hat on the gay hairdresser guy. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8966.9s)]
*  It's kooky. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8969.46s)]
*  I agree with you. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8970.1s)]
*  It's also like imagine, you know, inheriting this problem. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8970.82s)]
*  Like you've had open borders for four years, [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8977.06s)]
*  and they've let thousands and thousands of potential criminals in here, if not millions. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8979.22s)]
*  They've let millions of people, [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8983.86s)]
*  who knows how many of these people are suspected terrorists? [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8985.539999999999s)]
*  It's not just one. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8989.859999999999s)]
*  It's not zero. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8991.3s)]
*  Okay, so what's the number? [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8992.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8993.619999999999s)]
*  How many of them are gang members? [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8994.419999999998s)]
*  Is it zero? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8996.019999999999s)]
*  No, it's not zero. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8996.74s)]
*  So they let in gang members. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8997.619999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=8999.539999999999s)]
*  How many of them are in the cartel? [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9000.66s)]
*  It's not zero. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9002.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, what the fuck do you do? [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9002.9s)]
*  What do you do if you want to clean up this mess that has been en masse for four years? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9005.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9010.9s)]
*  Flooded, open borders, not just open borders, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9011.779999999999s)]
*  but like busing them in, flying them in, giving them debit cards, giving them phones. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9014.34s)]
*  Oh my god, interest-free loans in California, [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9022.18s)]
*  loopholes that Gavin Newsom has created to give them healthcare. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9024.98s)]
*  Billions of dollars in healthcare. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9028.26s)]
*  My friggin 35-year-old brother can't get a home loan and can't get healthcare, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9028.9s)]
*  but his tax dollars, like this is- [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9034.1s)]
*  He needs to change his name in Mexico and walk across the border. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9035.460000000001s)]
*  I told him a couple of times, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9037.7s)]
*  I was like, Greg, you know, burn the passport, babe. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9040.5s)]
*  This will work, you know. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9042.9s)]
*  He's half Latin, he's my half brother, he could get away with it, he looks the part. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9044.34s)]
*  It is bananas. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9047.54s)]
*  It's all a political ploy, and the idea that they're not doing it to get votes is crazy, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9051.14s)]
*  because that's what they're doing. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9056.1s)]
*  There's a reason why a vast majority of them get moved to swing states, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9057.54s)]
*  like they're doing it on purpose. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9061.14s)]
*  I, okay. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9062.9s)]
*  And Elon has been talking about this, [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9063.86s)]
*  and it's one of the other reasons why they call him a Nazi. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9065.7s)]
*  I've had this conversation with intelligent people, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9068.74s)]
*  and they're like, well, there's no evidence that they're voting. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9072.5s)]
*  Okay, but if we were to game this all the way out, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9075.46s)]
*  if I was to hit Elon's points that I believe I understand, [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9079.54s)]
*  first of all, I think they can vote in some states in local elections. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9082.34s)]
*  Yes, in New York. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9085.06s)]
*  Karen Bass becomes Gavin Newsom, becomes, God forbid, the President of the United States. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9086.98s)]
*  So there's a reason we've got this whole grassroots thing going on, I'd imagine. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9091.46s)]
*  And then I'm told that when they sign up for benefits, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9095.62s)]
*  they potentially can reach out to them to vote. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9097.86s)]
*  That could be conspiracy theory, though. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9102.42s)]
*  Very much so. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9103.94s)]
*  I'm talking out of my ass. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9104.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9105.7s)]
*  Right, but it's not a conspiracy that they're giving them Social Security numbers. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9106.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9109.62s)]
*  Oh, did not know that. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9110.1s)]
*  Yeah, because if you, there's a woman who was explaining [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9111.54s)]
*  when she was working for the Social Security office what they would have her do. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9115.86s)]
*  So they would have them get permanent disability. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9121.220000000001s)]
*  And the way they get permanent disability is just to have to say you have a back problem. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9125.22s)]
*  So if you have a back problem, then you have permanent disability. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9129.06s)]
*  And if you get permanent disability, then they start labeling them as a client. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9131.779999999999s)]
*  If you label them as a client, then they get money forever. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9135.06s)]
*  And so if then you have people like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all these people saying, [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9139.859999999999s)]
*  we need to give these people a road to citizenship. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9145.46s)]
*  Okay, well, then you potentially have millions and millions of people. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9148.34s)]
*  Now, if the Democrats are in charge, they can change the rules and make it so that these people [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9151.54s)]
*  have a road to citizenship. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9156.5s)]
*  Then they can vote on elections. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9157.94s)]
*  So now you've imported millions of people that are going to vote for sure for the people who gave [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9160.02s)]
*  them the money, not for the people who hired Tom Holman to kick everybody out. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9165.140000000001s)]
*  Here's another question. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9169.060000000001s)]
*  Why are you not requiring identification to vote? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9170.820000000002s)]
*  Because it's racist. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9173.220000000001s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9175.7s)]
*  Not only are you not requiring it. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9175.94s)]
*  In California, you're not allowed to show it. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9177.380000000001s)]
*  It is illegal to show your identification when you vote. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9179.3s)]
*  There's only one reason why you would do that is because you want fraud. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9184.179999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9189.06s)]
*  When I ask people who are on the other side, I'm like, game this out for me. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9189.46s)]
*  Steal man this argument. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9193.46s)]
*  Is he Kathy Holtzschul's logic about that? [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9195.46s)]
*  No. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9197.859999999999s)]
*  A lot of these black kids, they don't even know what a computer is. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9198.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, I have seen that. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9200.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9201.3s)]
*  And I saw the black guy making fun of her. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9201.939999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9203.859999999999s)]
*  They're just like running around the computer. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9204.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9206.34s)]
*  Which is the most racist thing that you could possibly say. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9208.26s)]
*  By the way, every fucking kid has a computer. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9212.9s)]
*  They all have phones. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9215.62s)]
*  Did you see that video? [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9216.42s)]
*  I think it came out of PragerU where they were saying like, well, you know, black people don't, [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9217.220000000001s)]
*  they don't have access to ID and they can't figure out same thing. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9223.7s)]
*  It's the most disgustingly racist thing that you can say. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9227.380000000001s)]
*  What about poor white people that live in West Virginia? [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9231.220000000001s)]
*  It's so gross. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9234.1s)]
*  Dirt poor. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9235.06s)]
*  Staggeringly gross. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9235.7s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9237.38s)]
*  Okay. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9239.46s)]
*  How about this one? [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9239.619999999999s)]
*  I've also been told that the more people you have in a census, [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9240.42s)]
*  it doesn't matter if they're legal citizens to get more representation. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9244.259999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you get more seats. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9246.98s)]
*  Well, then effectively you can make a president a lame duck if you've got. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9247.699999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9250.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9250.98s)]
*  And that's why California is losing seats because people are escaping. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9251.46s)]
*  Escaping is the perfect word. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9256.339999999998s)]
*  That is what it is. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9256.9s)]
*  It's escaping. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9257.699999999999s)]
*  I go on record as saying I am pro-legal immigration. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9258.5s)]
*  Well, I'm the grandchild of immigrants. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9263.06s)]
*  My whole family came from Italy and Ireland. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9265.38s)]
*  Unless you're a Native American. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9268.099999999999s)]
*  When you appreciate the ways in which legal immigration enriches a community, [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9271.699999999999s)]
*  stimulates the economy, and you can control the flow, and as Gadzad likes to explain, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9277.539999999999s)]
*  they support their host community when they're brought in legally. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9284.179999999998s)]
*  When it's illegal, it overwhelms the infrastructure. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9288.42s)]
*  You bring in criminals. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9291.3s)]
*  You don't know who's here. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9292.259999999998s)]
*  Suicidal empathy. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9293.619999999999s)]
*  Brilliant. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9296.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9296.74s)]
*  He's such a genius. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9297.06s)]

*  For many years now. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9300.98s)]
*  And I mean, he's an absolute genius. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9302.34s)]
*  He articulates it like no one else. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9304.5s)]
*  And he's, you know, seeing the rise of anti-Semitism in Montreal right now at a staggering rate. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9306.259999999998s)]
*  I have to admit that I. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9313.22s)]
*  He's a guy that escaped Lebanon for the same reasons. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9314.34s)]
*  I do tend to lean. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9317.3s)]

*  I reached out to him and I was like, all right, I got to tell you, I've always leaned [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9323.779999999999s)]
*  more pro-Israel and you opened my mind to a few things and I. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9327.699999999999s)]
*  Don't become a monster. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9332.82s)]

*  Anti-Semites. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9334.98s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9335.539999999999s)]
*  I'll be. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9336.34s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9336.58s)]
*  It's like the horrors that you're seeing in Gaza, it's like, okay, you're fighting Hamas. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9337.38s)]

*  and simply thought like you can't gatekeep information and people are, [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9474.34s)]
*  if somebody is going to believe that if this was in fact the truth, right, [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9477.38s)]
*  and he was this guy that was saying Hitler was innocent and or not innocent, [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9480.74s)]
*  but the lesser evil with regard to Churchill versus Hitler. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9484.18s)]

*  of hid his anti-Semitism early on and that early on during his rise, he would keep it confide, [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9494.9s)]
*  like the really rampant anti-Semitism, he keep it confined to these like smaller meetings. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9502.02s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9506.34s)]

*  A lot of it. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9666.18s)]
*  A lot of evil. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9667.06s)]
*  A lot of horrible consequences and a lot of lessons that we really learn but then unlearn. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9668.74s)]
*  And that's what people are terrified of with this like Hitler apologist perspective. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9673.78s)]
*  Like don't unlearn this one huge fucking lesson that, you know, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9678.66s)]
*  look, a guy like Hitler can exist. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9684.82s)]
*  They can rise to power and become monsters and destroy countless lives. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9687.46s)]
*  Like it's impossible to really quantify the amount of damage that guy did. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9692.74s)]
*  Don't unlearn that. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9698.66s)]

*  I get that. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9700.58s)]
*  But don't also label someone as someone who didn't learn that when they're talking about it openly. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9701.06s)]
*  Discussing. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9707.699999999999s)]
*  I mean, Daryl talks about what a fucking psychotic drug addled monster Hitler was all the time. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9708.58s)]
*  Like it's a part of his stuff. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9714.5s)]
*  You would have to actually consume his work and Douglas admittedly never listened to him. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9716.18s)]
*  He was just taking this narrative, this like very reductionist narrative that's very [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9720.900000000001s)]
*  incorrect and just saying it over and over again and saying it on Bill Maher to applause breaks. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9727.94s)]
*  But it's not what he's saying. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9732.660000000002s)]
*  I saw that. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9733.54s)]
*  It's stupid. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9734.02s)]
*  I did see that. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9734.660000000002s)]
*  I was kind of disappointed by it. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9735.54s)]

*  It's disappointing. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9742.26s)]
*  I hear you. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9743.140000000001s)]
*  Do you find that you fall victim to that sometimes? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9744.18s)]
*  I see myself do it on occasion where you hear a narrative and I don't dig deeper on it. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9746.58s)]
*  And I've been guilty of it a couple of times. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9752.98s)]
*  I apologized to Bobby Kennedy when he came here because I said I believed everything about you. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9757.06s)]
*  Before I read your book, I thought you were this kook who doesn't believe in vaccines. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9761.460000000001s)]
*  And he's an anti-science guy and a conspiracy theorist. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9765.78s)]
*  And then I read the real Anthony Fauci. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9768.82s)]
*  I was like, oh, that book's fucking. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9770.66s)]
*  Nuts. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9774.26s)]
*  It is. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9774.82s)]
*  And by the way, again, said it before, say it again, he would be sued if it wasn't true. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9775.460000000001s)]
*  And it is true. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9780.02s)]
*  And what he did during the just what he did during the AIDS crisis. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9780.98s)]
*  And I know that they they gave him a blanket pardon from everything from 2014. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9784.58s)]
*  Weird. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9789.460000000001s)]
*  Where did they choose that date? [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9790.26s)]
*  Where they choose that date when Obama decided to get rid of gain of function research. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9792.26s)]
*  And this motherfucker was like outsourcing it. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9796.98s)]
*  Yep, he was. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9799.300000000001s)]

*  Go to that page again, because it's kind of hilarious. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9810.02s)]

*  That might be how they tricked him into putting this page out there. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9818.18s)]

*  Obama put a moratorium on it. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9823.94s)]

*  Wuhan is home to China's foremost SARS research lab, which has a history of conducting gain of [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVP2dwURrD0&t=9876.58s)]
