# Joe Rogan Experience #1569 - John Mackey
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 24, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHXIQhvI8cw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Hello John.
*  Hey Joe.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  Likewise.
*  Thank you for welcoming me to Austin and thanks for the food.
*  No one's ever brought me food here.
*  I'm a grocer, that's what I do.
*  I know but you brought me actual frozen meat so thank you very much.
*  Frozen meat, some vegan cheese.
*  Yeah that will go to friends.
*  It's really good.
*  It's really good.
*  Does it taste good or is it good for you?
*  Both.
*  It's just made strictly out of almonds.
*  That's all that's there.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah taste it.
*  It's a cream cheese with chives in it.
*  It's delicious.
*  I really just like almonds.
*  Can I just have almonds?
*  You can but you'll like the cheese.
*  Give it a try.
*  I know you're an open minded man.
*  Yeah I am.
*  I'll try your vegan cheese.
*  Okay.
*  But you're sending me mixed signals.
*  You gave me frozen elk meat and vegan cheese.
*  I'm covering all bases.
*  What I want to talk to you about, well first of all you have a book out.
*  The book is Conscious Capitalism.
*  That book that's out is Conscious Leadership which is a sequel to, you already have that
*  book.
*  Right but I have this one right here.
*  Yeah because I brought that today.
*  And Conscious Leadership, a sequel to Conscious Capitalism.
*  For a lot of people that's an oxymoron.
*  It's jumbo shrimp or military intelligence.
*  Conscious Capitalism.
*  Today in this day and age, this very strange time, there's a large, I shouldn't say a
*  large segment but it's a very squeaky wheel.
*  There's a segment of our culture that thinks that capitalism is evil.
*  Yeah I'm not in that classification.
*  In fact I think the opposite.
*  I think capitalism is the greatest thing humanity has ever done.
*  It's been capital, if you go back just 200 years ago when capitalism was really getting
*  going, 94% of the people alive on the planet earth lived on less than $2 a day.
*  And that's adjusted for inflation.
*  94%.
*  Today it's under 10%.
*  If you go back 200 years ago, the average lifespan was 30.
*  Now it's 72.6.
*  Advanced countries it's about 80.
*  Illiteracy rates 200 years ago where 88% of the world couldn't read.
*  Now it's down to 12%.
*  But can you attribute that solely to capitalism?
*  Or wouldn't you attribute that to innovation and technology?
*  That's the right name for capitalism.
*  Karl Marx called it capitalism.
*  What it really is, a better name which we talked about in Conscious Leadership, is innovationism.
*  Continuous innovation is how humanity progresses.
*  But it's business that takes the innovations of science and puts them into forms that create
*  value for other people.
*  So it's been capitalism or innovationism that's lifted humanity out of the dirt, that's transforming
*  our world.
*  Even as we speak, it's amazing just what's happened in the last, in my lifetime it's
*  astounding all the progress that humanity's made.
*  And we're going through a tough year right now, so it doesn't work in a perfect linear
*  line.
*  But the trend lines are clear.
*  The book I always try to get everybody to read is Steven Pinker's book, Enlightenment
*  Now.
*  You ever take a look at that book?
*  I haven't, but I'm a big fan of a lot of his work.
*  That book just documents, it's just unbelievable how he documents progress since the Enlightenment.
*  It's incredible.
*  The problem that a lot of people have with capitalism is they attribute capitalism to
*  greed.
*  They attribute greed and the problems of the world and environmental destruction and ignoring
*  climate change.
*  They attribute that to capitalism.
*  They think that the way out of this is socialism, some type of socialism.
*  But in my opinion, the people that are saying that, I don't think there's anything wrong
*  with contributing and contributing to a better community in terms of making healthcare more
*  affordable or free, making education more affordable or free.
*  Human beings need incentives in order to perform.
*  That's just human nature, whether we like it or not.
*  If you want a system that allows for a continual progress of innovation, like constant innovation,
*  you've got to give people incentives to do that.
*  Just the human animal strives to achieve for whatever reason.
*  Totally agree.
*  I mean, it's not like socialism hasn't been tried.
*  In the last 100 years, 42 countries have tried socialism and there have been 42 failures.
*  Isn't it amazing that it's still popular?
*  Because people just believe, well, because a new generation doesn't know their history.
*  And they just believe it hasn't been done right yet.
*  This time, give me the power and I'll make sure it gets done right.
*  But it can't be done right.
*  It's intrinsically flawed.
*  And they fall back on the Scandinavian argument.
*  What about Sweden and Denmark and Norway?
*  If you look at the Economic Freedom Index, those are some of the most capitalistic countries in the world.
*  In the Economic Freedom Index, for example, Denmark's listed one place below the United States.
*  It's like number 12.
*  Sweden's like number 20.
*  United States is like number 13 or 14.
*  So Iceland is the freest of those Scandinavian countries.
*  So Sweden's held up as an example.
*  But what people don't realize is the corporate income taxes in Sweden are only 21 percent.
*  They have no inheritance taxes at all.
*  They have universal vouchers for education.
*  So free competition in education, not a monopoly.
*  They are probably in a lot of ways more capitalistic than Americans are.
*  So what is it that they point to when they point to these Scandinavian countries?
*  What are they using as an example of them being a shining light of socialism?
*  In some sense, they're still stuck in the 60s when Sweden did an experiment with socialism before it moved away from it.
*  They're still living in the 60s.
*  And yet they tried it and their economy tanked.
*  What did they try? How did they try it?
*  They socialized industry.
*  They had government-owned the means of productions in most of these large corporations.
*  And they had very high business taxes.
*  And a lot of people like Bjorn Borg is a good example.
*  He was driven out of Sweden or Ingmar Bergman driven out for unbelievably high taxes.
*  So, hey, just like you've been driven out of California.
*  Yeah, I wasn't driven out of it because of that.
*  If California was still open the way Texas is, I would have stayed.
*  I saw the writing on the wall with many things.
*  One of them was that they were closing restaurants and bars and comedy clubs.
*  And they weren't closing them in other states.
*  And I didn't think that they were recognizing that there's an impact health-wise.
*  There's also a health impact if you destroy the economy.
*  And that impact, like you're not people that get COVID, most people survive.
*  When your economy tanks and 40 plus percent of your businesses are gone,
*  I don't think economically you're going to bounce back nearly as well.
*  I think it's a very dangerous place to be.
*  Like Los Angeles right now, if you're a business owner, it's a dangerous place to be.
*  Because all of a sudden governors are acting like autocrats.
*  And there was a recent ruling where he lost in court
*  because he's passing legislation on his own.
*  He's making mandates on his own that the rest of the state doesn't agree with.
*  And they're not going through the normal process.
*  And they've stopped him from doing that now.
*  But look, they still just put, they imposed a curfew in Los Angeles of 10 p.m.
*  Just random curfew.
*  Like how is that stopping?
*  All you're doing is limiting people.
*  You're limiting, you're not, there's no emphasis whatsoever
*  on strengthening people's immune system or on health.
*  And all this emphasis on tanking the economy.
*  All this emphasis on closing businesses down.
*  And I just saw the writing on the wall.
*  I'm like, this place is fucking doomed.
*  I think you're telling the truth there, Joe, I agree.
*  I just can't believe that, see before,
*  it didn't matter that much who your governor was or who your mayor was.
*  When everything was going well, people didn't think about it that much.
*  You would be like, oh, the mayor, whatever the fuck his name is, he's kind of goofy.
*  Who cares?
*  Let's go to work.
*  And you would just do your normal thing, go, this is America.
*  How bad can they fuck this up?
*  And then you realize in time of crisis when they assume these powers that they
*  never had before.
*  And then you realize how insanely hypocritical they are.
*  Well, thankfully, the governor of California, not my governor anymore,
*  I got a Texas license now.
*  Give me some knuckles.
*  Congratulations.
*  Thank you.
*  But when they caught him at that restaurant, the French Laundry,
*  eating with no mask on, inside, no social distancing.
*  All the things that he tells everybody to do,
*  tells everybody to put a mask on in between your bites of food.
*  And then he's not doing it himself.
*  You're like, okay, this is exactly like his aunt, Nancy Pelosi,
*  when she got busted going to a beauty parlor with no mask on while they were all
*  closed down.
*  It's rules for you, but not rules for them.
*  It's disgusting.
*  Right.
*  I mean, is it really about the COVID or is it about the rules?
*  Well, human beings love telling people what to do.
*  They do. They really do.
*  And if they have a reason where they can justify that,
*  that it seems feasible, like COVID, then they just start imposing those rules.
*  And if people are frightened, they're more likely to go along with those rules, too.
*  Imagine if instead of doing what they did,
*  imagine if they spent a lot of time telling people how to strengthen their
*  immune system. Imagine if they distributed free vitamins.
*  Imagine if they put money into keeping these hospitals
*  well-staffed, hired more people,
*  and maybe even possibly tried to talk about opening up alternative
*  hospitals if there was some overflow, but allowed people to go to work.
*  Told people, look, wear your mask, social distance, take care of your health,
*  do all these things.
*  But we can't fucking tank the economy for nine months and not expect disaster.
*  Well, we actually have some good examples out there.
*  And even though it gets a lot of criticism, the way Sweden handled it
*  is probably, again, more aligned with how America might have handled it
*  in the previous decades.
*  Is that comparable, though, because Sweden is so small in comparison.
*  I mean, you have Stockholm, you have some cities,
*  but you have all these like small villages and people are generally healthier
*  there, too.
*  I think it's comparable in the sense that
*  in general, people are the best judges for what's best for themselves.
*  I mean, government can give advice.
*  They made recommendations to people in Sweden.
*  They just didn't coerce them.
*  They just didn't force them to have a curfew here.
*  Their kids went to school and
*  people in general, people can make good decisions for themselves
*  and their families are the ones that should be making the decisions,
*  not the government.
*  100 percent. I couldn't agree more.
*  And that is the difference between the way Texas approached this
*  and the way California did.
*  That's what drove me out of California.
*  Yeah, the high taxes are stupid, but I like living there.
*  Those friends were there because where is it more beautiful
*  in the whole world than California?
*  It's an amazing climate.
*  It's it's it's just very, very incredibly beautiful place.
*  I love I love from fires to.
*  Well, that's true.
*  I love to I love to visit California, but I wouldn't want to live there.
*  The the comedy community there is pretty awesome.
*  It's the comedy store and the improv.
*  I mean, it's just two of the best clubs in the world.
*  And they're right in this one city and the community of comedians is just fantastic.
*  And the fact that was L.A.
*  Was it the Silicon Valley, so to speak, of comedy?
*  Maybe better. Yeah, because Silicon Valley is I mean,
*  there's other parts of the world that have technology hubs, right?
*  There's not really another comedy hub other than New York.
*  Chicago? Not really.
*  No, no. Chicago is Second City, which is a improv hub.
*  It's different.
*  You know, there's a great history of sketch comedy out of there, of course.
*  You know, Second City is where, you know, Belushi came from
*  and a lot of great sketch comedians came from.
*  But as far as stand up, it's really L.A. and New York.
*  It used to be Boston had a big part of it.
*  And Boston still has a small community.
*  Austin has right here.
*  Austin, Texas has a small community that's always been very good.
*  Like Kenison and Hicks.
*  Hicks actually came out of here.
*  Have you done stand up in Austin here? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I did Stubbs Barbecue last week.
*  And then I did Vulcan Gas Company the week before.
*  So, yeah, I'm I'm getting rolling again.
*  Ultimately, I'm going to open up a club here.
*  So you still love doing stand up.
*  It's the most fun.
*  It's the most fun, John.
*  I know I'm not interviewing you, but when you were like a kid,
*  were you like were you the class clown? No.
*  I came later. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You were a good boy.
*  No, no, I wasn't a good boy at all.
*  Most of my friends thought I was crazy.
*  They never thought I was going to be a comedian.
*  Like if you talk to the people that I went to high school with.
*  You told me earlier that that comedians as a general rule are kind of screwed up.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. 100 percent.
*  Yeah. As a general rule to want to do that, to want to humiliate yourself,
*  get on stage and the failure,
*  the bombing is some of the most intense emotional pain
*  a person can ever subject themselves to or be subject.
*  Is it worse than like getting rejected by a girl that you're in love with?
*  It's like sucking a thousand dicks in front of your mother.
*  That's how I usually describe it.
*  But it's different and worse because some guys would probably like doing that.
*  There's some people that are like, watch, mom, this is who I am.
*  And then they would they would enjoy it.
*  Get over it. Yeah. Get over it, mom.
*  No one likes bombing.
*  Somebody might like sucking a thousand dicks for their mom.
*  No one likes bombing.
*  It's just an awful feeling because.
*  You're demanding attention and you don't deserve it.
*  And the audience is like, you don't deserve this attention.
*  And you know you don't deserve it.
*  So you have this like deep self-hate, but you have to get through that
*  to get good at it.
*  It's an inevitable part of the whole process of doing stand up.
*  You kind of sync up with the audience.
*  Can you kind of tell what's going to land that night?
*  You change your your show, so to speak, as you pick up the feeling in the audience.
*  You move around a little, depending upon how you feel and how they feel.
*  But, you know, you have an act and your act is.
*  But you have a lot of different things, a lot of things you could do.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of things you talk about.
*  I mean, as you like say, I don't think this joke's going to land
*  with this particular audience.
*  You just you go through you go through them.
*  They need to hear this.
*  It's you know, it's it gives you an opportunity to try to figure out
*  a better way to word it or a better way to justify your position
*  or a better or a softer way to land it.
*  You know, it's like there's like there's a lot of different weird things
*  that are going on when you're doing comedy.
*  Comedy is kind of like mass hypnosis.
*  That's what it's like.
*  You know, I do a lot of public speaking.
*  So I have learned that there's, you know, and you have to sync up with the audience.
*  And I can I can just tell whether this is going to land well
*  with this particular group or whether it's not.
*  And I sort of adjust on the fly.
*  I still have a speech I'm going to give, but I do alter it as I go along.
*  I shorten some stuff, lengthen other stuff,
*  and I substitute if I think that's going to bomb out.
*  So I think public speaking, like what you're doing when you're standing up
*  and talking about a very particular subject is almost more open ended
*  because you really never know what kind of crowd you're going to get,
*  whether they're going to be in a good mood or a bad mood,
*  whether they're bored or hot or cold.
*  When you go to see comedy, generally people go there because they want to have fun.
*  So they have a good perspective when they get there.
*  Like, I've come here to have fun and laugh.
*  I hope these comedians are funny.
*  Like you go there with a little bit of a smile on your face when you sit down.
*  Like, here we go. It's going to be fun.
*  Yeah. And so they have a predisposition to want to laugh.
*  And yes, they're not going there to judge you.
*  They're going there to laugh.
*  And some people are. But those people are, you know, that they are.
*  They already didn't like you before they went there.
*  Or, you know, there's some people that think they're going, oh, I want to go
*  home and heckle, I'm going to show them what's up.
*  There's this kind of people.
*  But in generally, clubs kick those people out.
*  Really, most people that come to comedy clubs, they go because it's fun.
*  Look, I still love comedy as a as an audience member.
*  I enjoy it as a customer. It's fun.
*  I love watching great comedians. It feels good to laugh.
*  I love I love their creativity.
*  Do you learn a lot from other comedians?
*  Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. You learn what makes you laugh.
*  You like sometimes I'll see someone performing and it'll give it'll inspire me.
*  I'm like, wow, that guy really put a lot into that or wow, her writing is so
*  so clever and it'll make you it'll fire up your neurons.
*  It'll get you excited. You do your all your own writing.
*  Yes. Yeah, I do all my own writing.
*  Is that common or unusual?
*  Or most most comedians do that.
*  Yeah, there's only a few comics that like occasionally.
*  Am I giving you any material right now?
*  No, not yet. OK.
*  Maybe it'll happen.
*  Occasionally, comedians will write taglines for each other.
*  Like Michelle Wolf gave me a great tagline after we did a show together.
*  The other night, she gave me a really nice tagline.
*  I was like, oh, right.
*  Right when she said, what was it? That's nice.
*  Is it secret? I'll tell you later.
*  I have to have to pay to go to the club.
*  No, I'll tell you. I just don't want to say it off.
*  I didn't know you censored yourself when you were doing not censoring myself, John.
*  Why are you making me uncomfortable?
*  Make me sensitive.
*  It's it's often a particularly good place to do comedy
*  because there's a great history of standup comedy in Texas.
*  Like Kinnison, who's arguably one of the greatest of all time.
*  You know, this is where he cut his teeth.
*  This is where it all went together for him.
*  So Austin, like when I first started doing standup,
*  I was selling out in Houston before I was selling out anywhere
*  because for whatever reason, they had this longing for that kind of raw
*  comedy that you really it's hard to get in a lot of places
*  that are maybe a little bit too politically correct.
*  Like there's certain places where they're they're so woke.
*  They're almost like they want to laugh, but they want to call you out
*  on your comedy almost as much as they want to laugh.
*  And they don't want to get criticized for laughing on something
*  that they shouldn't laugh at, right?
*  We were talking about this before the show.
*  They should go in disguise.
*  Yeah, right. Like a Groucho Marx. Exactly. Exactly.
*  Glasses and mustache.
*  Well, you get some great disguises today, you know, like the prosthetics
*  and all the stuff that they can do today.
*  Now, if you want to go to a comedy show and just laugh the most horrible shit.
*  Maybe some of them are doing that.
*  It's I don't think they are, John.
*  I don't think people think that far in advance.
*  Maybe like a very, very small percentage of the population.
*  Have you been to a lot of standup comedy?
*  I haven't. No, I confess.
*  Just been working my ass off for.
*  I think it would be interesting for you just from the perspective
*  of the fact that you do a lot of these public speaking gigs, you know,
*  like I think you would.
*  I think whenever you get the chance to see someone else
*  perform in a different way, like I like going to see musicians
*  because I have zero talent.
*  I have no musical talent at all.
*  So when I go to see a musician, I can just enjoy it solely as an audience member.
*  I don't have to remove myself from the like like as a fellow comic.
*  I'll judge someone's delivery or timing, even though I'm trying to just enjoy it.
*  There's always going to be a part of you that's like, oh, this is kind of clunky.
*  Like, why is he setting it up like this?
*  But when you go to see music, I could just enjoy someone performing.
*  I think I get something out of that.
*  I'm going to give it another try.
*  I'll tell you. I'll tell you when I'm in town next.
*  The back to the subject of capitalism,
*  capitalism and Marxism and socialism.
*  This right now, we're in a wave of this, right?
*  It's become more popular now.
*  I would say over the last, particularly during the Trump administration,
*  the concept of socialism, at least, has become more more publicly discussed
*  than any time that I can remember in my life.
*  Why do you think that is?
*  I think it's because the generation that's coming up is, I mean,
*  you have to understand the academic community is is.
*  I always say the intellectuals have always been the enemy of business,
*  enemy of certainly the enemy of capitalism.
*  And but why is that?
*  I think because in a in a market society,
*  which has been rare in history, we haven't mostly had market societies,
*  but they're not very important in a market society.
*  The intellectuals aren't very important.
*  Generally not as important.
*  Are they the ones that inspire the minds of the people that create
*  and maybe innovate in the industry?
*  They don't have the same social status that the entrepreneurs have.
*  Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos.
*  So you think it's an ego issue?
*  The social status issue?
*  Think about it this way. You're going to school, OK?
*  And people that end up teaching in the universities
*  were always the smartest kids in the school generally.
*  And they and they did well in school.
*  I mean, smart in terms of doing well in school.
*  And they go on to college and then they they go and get a Ph.D.
*  And then they that's all they've known is school.
*  That's that's been their universe. Right.
*  And they excelled at it.
*  And they were smarter than the other kids in school.
*  And now these other kids, they go to college and they get a degree
*  in business and they're in a fraternity and and they make a lot of friends
*  in relationships and they and they make more money than the intellectuals do.
*  And that seems like that's completely unfair.
*  It's an unjust world that this less smart people are making more money
*  than the smart people do.
*  And they have more status in the society.
*  And I think I think that's under under underlying it is a resentment
*  or an envy of a society that doesn't judge them to be as important
*  as they judge themselves.
*  That's interesting.
*  But I think it's a very flawed perspective.
*  And first of all, the term smart is a weird term.
*  I said smart in terms of school.
*  I didn't say in terms of street smarts or ability to do things,
*  to connect with people.
*  There's emotional intelligence.
*  I'm merely saying they're good at taking tests, writing papers,
*  abstracting thoughts, essentially.
*  Yeah, but this is what I'm saying. That just the term smart.
*  It's almost like the problem is it's like a blanket term, right?
*  It's like drugs.
*  You know, it applies to a bunch of different things
*  that don't necessarily seem to be related.
*  But the people that are interested in that pursue that.
*  The fact that they can understand that there's an intact like
*  Elon Musk is a great example.
*  If you don't think Elon Musk is intelligent, you're either do not.
*  You're in. You're not very intelligent yourself.
*  You don't think Elon Musk is intelligent.
*  You're delusional or you're a liar or you're in denial.
*  It's one of those things.
*  There's something wrong with the way you think.
*  He's clearly intelligent.
*  But there's people that call him a fool.
*  And like the guy's running like four different businesses
*  simultaneously, they're all successful.
*  And he's innovating with when it comes to space travel in a way
*  that you would assume that someone have to dedicate most of their life
*  just singularly to that task to be able to figure out past NASA
*  how to shoot a rocket up into space and have it land and then reuse it.
*  No one's been able to do that besides him or up until he did it.
*  And I think Jeff Bezos' company is doing the same thing.
*  Yeah. To Blue Origin. Yeah.
*  They're they're obviously two of the great entrepreneurs
*  of this particular era.
*  But I don't think Jeff Bezos is actually engineering these things.
*  But if you think about it, the intellectuals have always disliked business.
*  They've always discriminated against the merchant classes,
*  the Jews in the West, Chinese in the East.
*  There's really been no historical period where intellectuals praised business,
*  maybe a little bit around the time of Adam Smith,
*  up until probably Ricardo and Malthus wrote in the early 19th century.
*  That is for the most part, business people have been seen.
*  They're disruptive.
*  They change things. They upset the status quo.
*  They innovate.
*  Well, a lot of people don't like innovations. It's threatening.
*  It changes. It changes social status.
*  It changes wealth relationships.
*  That it's almost like capitalism is like a genie that got out of the bottle.
*  And they're trying very hard to stuff the genie back in the bottle
*  as much as they can.
*  And I think if you think about it that way,
*  you'll understand we're never going to win the intellectuals over.
*  I mean, I speak in universities all the time and the students,
*  I'm an entrepreneur, I self-identify that way.
*  Students love when I talk about conscious capitalism.
*  I say you can do good and you can do well.
*  There's no contradiction here. You're not.
*  You're the good guys here. You're not the bad guys.
*  Do you debate people about this? I do.
*  I've debated a number of socialists.
*  And what is their primary argument?
*  Their primary argument is, is that business is greedy and selfish.
*  And it's about motivations,
*  that business people have the wrong motivations.
*  In a lot of ways, conscious capitalism is an answer to that.
*  It's a complete answer to that, because in the book
*  and in Conscious Leadership as well, we're basically arguing that business
*  isn't primarily about maximizing profits.
*  Business is primarily about creating value for other people.
*  And through creating value for other people, you do make a profit.
*  But it's the value creation that comes first.
*  The profits come second in exchange. Right.
*  And it's almost if you are creating value, then you are profitable.
*  And then you can reinvest those profits and you and you have this upwards spiral.
*  So that's that business has this potential for higher purpose.
*  It's not primarily about greed.
*  Greed is found in human nature, Joe.
*  It's not just found in business people.
*  There are plenty of greedy governmental officials,
*  plenty of greedy politicians, greedy lawyers.
*  Greed is endemic to the human nature.
*  Business people either have no more or no less than it.
*  It's just part of who we are.
*  Has anyone ever laid it out in a way that's very compelling?
*  Like when you have these debates with socialists and someone has anyone
*  ever laid it out in a way where they have a point where you see their point?
*  You always the best way to do a debate is completely understand
*  the other side's position. Yeah.
*  I understand it as good or better than they understand it.
*  And so I've read widely in socialistic literature.
*  I think I do understand it.
*  It's it's it's a type of utopianism.
*  It's it's an attempt to change human nature.
*  If we would all be if we would all love each other and if we'd all share equally,
*  then the world would be a better place.
*  And hey, guess what?
*  It probably would be if if we were naturally that way,
*  but we're not naturally that way.
*  We we look first generally for ourselves and our own families
*  and then our and our growing circle of relationships that we develop.
*  We want we don't it's not natural to.
*  It's natural to want your own children to have advantages.
*  That's that's just human nature to want your children to flourish
*  because you raise them, you love them.
*  And somehow or another to say that's unfair is cutting against human nature.
*  People are always going to look for for advantages or privileges,
*  so to speak, for their children.
*  People don't like when people have advantages and have and have victories
*  because then someone has to lose.
*  And when someone loses, they equate that someone losing with a bad feeling,
*  with that person being victimized.
*  So here's a big idea.
*  We talk about unconscious leadership.
*  We have a chapter called Find When When When Solutions.
*  The metaphors that we use to think about society tend to be very binary.
*  Good versus evil, light versus darkness, win versus lose.
*  And so they tend to think of business as a win, lose game.
*  Somebody wins and somebody else is losing.
*  But the beauty of capitalism is it's a win, win, win game.
*  It's an infinite game.
*  It's a game because the customers are winning or they wouldn't trade.
*  The employees are winning.
*  How are the customers winning?
*  They're getting products and services at a and and
*  and there's competition to make those services and products better.
*  The employees are winning because they have jobs and opportunities
*  to grow.
*  Benefits are paid and they do that voluntarily, not forced to work
*  for any particular company.
*  They do it because they think it's in their best interest.
*  When for the employees, the suppliers who are trading with the business,
*  they're winning as well.
*  They wouldn't make the exchanges.
*  Investors are winning or they wouldn't make the investments.
*  And the larger society is winning because business is the engine
*  that creates all the money that goes into nonprofits and governments.
*  Without business, there is no government and there is no
*  and there is no nonprofit sector because those are ultimately
*  supplied through what business creates.
*  So business is a win, win, win game.
*  All of these stakeholders are winning.
*  And that's why capitalism lifts society up.
*  Socialism is an attempt to reverse that back to a win, lose game.
*  And that's why it always fails.
*  And that's why capitalism always wins.
*  How is it an attempt to bring it back to a win, lose game?
*  And what were it?
*  It the ones that are winning, so to speak, the business people
*  are clamped down so they're not allowed to win.
*  It's like we're going to take your success and we're going to redistribute it.
*  So that is again, you said earlier on incentives matter,
*  but we're going to take away the incentives for business to really flourish and succeed.
*  They should do it from altruistic reasons.
*  And we may do some things for altruistic reasons,
*  but you cannot build a society around it.
*  When you're talking about win, win, win, this is a very in many ways.
*  It's I see what you're saying.
*  But there are things that are negative that are associated with profit
*  and innovation and particularly expanding industry, right?
*  Particularly environmental impacts.
*  Like when you talk, when you say win, win, win, like there's there's very rarely
*  when you're especially when you're dealing with creating and designing and building things.
*  You've got a negative impact in some way, environmentally.
*  Two points.
*  First of all, historically, socialism has been far worse, worse polluter than in capitalist countries.
*  Well, if you just look at the environmental destruction that the Soviet Union left behind it,
*  it was a complete disaster.
*  Right. But that's this is socialism done wrong, John.
*  We're going to do it right here.
*  Who has done it right, Joe?
*  No one's done it right.
*  But the Soviet Union is a bad example.
*  No, Stalin was.
*  Yeah, but all of Eastern Europe.
*  There's no incentive to protect the common good in socialism.
*  And they don't.
*  When the government has a monopoly of all decision and power making,
*  they don't tend to look out for the environment.
*  That's one of the myths.
*  You also take away agency from people and you take away their desire to improve and do better.
*  And without incentive, people just don't perform the same way.
*  But the beautiful thing about business, let's concede a partial truth to what you said,
*  that there will be unintended negative consequences, as you say, environmentally.
*  Well, that's why you have to regulate business to a certain extent.
*  That's why you have to make people responsible for their environmental pollutants.
*  And because business innovates and has an incentive to innovate,
*  business can innovate and create solutions to those environmental problems.
*  And let me stop you there for a second.
*  When you say make people responsible for their environmental pollutants,
*  then we're going to have to deal with another aspect of capitalism.
*  And that's the effect the special interest groups and lobbyists have on politicians,
*  because they create laws that shield these big businesses from consequences from these negative actions.
*  So by saying that they have to clean up their problem,
*  the only way that's ever going to happen is if they're not protected,
*  if they don't use that influence and money.
*  Totally agree.
*  So this is where I think a lot of people have a valid argument against capitalism.
*  The capitalism is kind of fucked over our our our system of government in a way,
*  because money has gotten so deeply involved with super PACs and lobbyists.
*  And there's so much money involved that it changes the way we we govern things.
*  Is that a flaw of capitalism or is that a flaw of government?
*  I think it's a flaw of government, but that government has been influenced by capitalism,
*  by capitalism's desire for universal growth, for constant growth.
*  The sad truth is that humanity is not perfectible.
*  We can never create the perfect system.
*  And the attempt to create the perfect system, the perfect seem to me the good.
*  Capitalism is not perfect.
*  It does not because human choices and what people want varies.
*  People to capitalism will sell cigarettes to people because that's what people want.
*  It gives them pleasure, but it's bad for their health.
*  But they're they're they're giving people what they want.
*  It's the same thing in any type of externality.
*  That's not that's not deliberately done to harm the society.
*  It's sort of a byproduct.
*  Right. But this is why win, win, win doesn't really work.
*  It's not really win, win, win.
*  It's win most of the time.
*  But with some negative consequences that are better than the alternative.
*  Right. But what you strive for is to is to take those externalities or those negative
*  consequences and try to through good government to to minimize them or lessen them.
*  I'll give you an example. So you used to live in L.A.
*  Well, when I went to L.A. back in the early 80s, it was like going to New Delhi today.
*  I couldn't see my lungs hurt less than 24 hours.
*  But through good regulations, the air in L.A. is a fraction as polluted as it was 40 years ago.
*  We have been able to clean it up.
*  That is an example of how you can take the worst impacts of industrialization and
*  ameliorate them or lessen them.
*  What do you think about the government of L.A.'s decision or the government or governor of
*  California, rather, his decision to eliminate all sales of combustion engine cars after 2035?
*  It's easy to.
*  My first thought is, is that a lot of times people make these proclamations in the future
*  that they'll never be around to see the ultimate that actually realized, meaning that it'll
*  be somebody else's problem then.
*  So it's a politician will make promises and claims for the future that they won't
*  themselves ever deliver on.
*  So I think that's well intentioned in terms of lessening environmental externalities from
*  the internal combustion engine or from carbon production.
*  However, is it realistic?
*  Is it possible?
*  I don't think so.
*  Well, there's also people that argue that's not even well intentioned.
*  If you look at the actual impact of dragging minerals out of the ground to make these
*  batteries, that the production of electric cars, it's not a zero impact on the environment
*  at all. It's like there's profound impact.
*  There is. There's no escape.
*  You know, humanity ever since humanity has been around, Joe, it's had a negative impact
*  on the environment.
*  Right.
*  If the hunters and gatherers wiped out most of the large animal species that they could
*  that were wild, they did it everywhere they went.
*  They did it in Europe. They did it in North America.
*  They did it in Australia.
*  Agriculture is when you take under a lot of land under cultivation, you're going to mow
*  down the jungles and they're going to graze cattle.
*  That's going to have a negative impact on the environment.
*  There's no escaping human humanity's impact on the environment.
*  It's always going to be there because guess what?
*  We're part of the environment.
*  The question is, how do we...
*  You can create the win-win-win.
*  You just can't create perfection.
*  We solve some problems and when new problems come up, every generation has to begin to
*  solve the problems of the problems that the parents couldn't solve.
*  I agree with you that capitalism is a better alternative.
*  And I agree because of all the things that we talked about, that it gives more incentive,
*  that having innovation and having these incentives creates better alternatives for people
*  in terms of how to live their life.
*  It gives them in terms of medicine and in terms of what's going on in the medical
*  industry, saving far more lives, fixing far more people that have been injured.
*  And I agree with all those things.
*  I think that sometimes we tend to want to put things in these very simplistic packages
*  like win-win-win.
*  And I don't necessarily think that's a...
*  Win-win-win is an ethical framework that you can use to think about situations like you
*  and I've met today.
*  So we can create win-wins between each other, you know, reciprocity.
*  I...
*  You...
*  In fact, we're probably doing that right now.
*  I have a new book that I love people to read.
*  And you gave me some vegan cheese.
*  And you're not paying me anything to come on your show.
*  And I usually get a lot of money when I speak.
*  So it's a win-win.
*  We're both gaining or we wouldn't be doing this.
*  Who pays you to speak?
*  Like generally, is it these business conferences?
*  Mostly.
*  So people want to learn about...
*  Mostly business conferences.
*  So people want to learn how you get it.
*  Trade shows.
*  Mostly...
*  One guy told me one time, he said...
*  He was really honest.
*  He said...
*  This was a few years ago.
*  And he said...
*  And there were like three pretty well-known business speakers, including myself.
*  And I said, how did you get all three of us?
*  And he said, you're all three were a lot cheaper than Hillary.
*  And the point is...
*  And cleaner.
*  And he told me, he said, look, it's simple.
*  We have a trade show.
*  They're mostly going to be on the floor.
*  This is the one time I can get everybody in around the industry, because they'll
*  come in to hear you speak or they hear the other speakers.
*  So we're paying you to put to put butts in the seats so we can hold our trade show
*  together.
*  So that's a win-win.
*  It's good for me.
*  They're paying me money.
*  It's good for them.
*  We're getting butts in the seats.
*  And we're paying you to put butts in the seats.
*  It's good for them.
*  We're getting butts in the seats to listen to their trade shows feel.
*  And also you want to give people...
*  I want to get my message out there.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to get my message out there about conscious capitalism.
*  This message, is this something that you have sort of developed over the years of
*  arguing with people about it?
*  No, it's mostly from what we did at Whole Foods, because I had no background in
*  business, right?
*  I'm an entrepreneur.
*  I didn't...
*  You guys started here, right?
*  In Austin.
*  That's right.
*  I first started here over 42 years ago.
*  Jesus, you look great.
*  How old are you?
*  67.
*  You look very good.
*  Well, thank you.
*  I tell you right now.
*  See?
*  Look, win-win-win.
*  We're in a win-win relationship.
*  You're eating all that Whole Foods food.
*  I'm eating all that healthy Whole Foods.
*  That is one thing that you guys did do that's very interesting, right?
*  You created a market where, like, if you tell people, I go to Whole Foods, you know,
*  people are like, oh, well, you care about your health.
*  Like, it's synonymous with healthy foods, even in the name.
*  Whole Foods.
*  That was our brand when we were up and comer.
*  And then when we got really rich, America loves the up and comer.
*  But then once you have become really successful, you're making a lot of money.
*  They start to turn on you.
*  Oh, no.
*  Well, we became Whole Paycheck.
*  Who said that?
*  I don't know.
*  But whoever did, I wish they...
*  I never saw it.
*  I never saw that until right now.
*  You just shit on yourself in a way that I never...
*  All I heard was Whole Foods.
*  I never heard Whole Paycheck.
*  Then your team didn't do good research.
*  I have no team.
*  So is this when you sold to Amazon?
*  No, no, the whole paycheck thing has been around for a long time.
*  Oh, because Whole Paycheck, meaning because it's so expensive.
*  Yes, because initially when we were up and comer, you if you shop at Whole Foods,
*  you were showing everybody you were sort of you were with it.
*  Yes. And you were hip and cool.
*  And then the narrative went sour because it's like
*  you're a fool for shopping there because you can get the same food cheaper elsewhere.
*  So you're going to Whole Paycheck.
*  So the narrative turned negative, so to speak.
*  I still see that pretty much all the time, although since our merger with Amazon,
*  we've cut our prices many, many times.
*  How did you do that?
*  Amazon allowed Whole Foods to think long term again.
*  We needed to cut our prices.
*  But when you're a public company, if you're selling something for a dollar
*  and you say, you know what, we need to sell this for 90 cents
*  and you start selling it for 90 cents in the short run,
*  you just cut your sales 10 percent because you're not selling any more of it.
*  Over the long term, people will realize, man, I can get a good deal for 90 cents.
*  They used to pay a buck for it.
*  And they start to shop with you more and your sales will go up.
*  But when you're a public company and the market's very short term oriented,
*  you pay a heavy price in the short term for reducing your prices.
*  And Amazon is willing to think long term and let Whole Foods do that.
*  Because Jeff Bezos got that long money, son.
*  He has a long money because he's had he's had a lot of
*  brilliant ideas and put together a pretty, pretty good team.
*  Yeah. What keeps that guy working when you when you have one hundred and fifty
*  in the bank, one hundred and fifty billion?
*  What keeps you going?
*  Well, most of it he has it in doesn't have it in the bank.
*  He's got it in stock.
*  A few in the bank.
*  He's got a few in the bank, probably.
*  I feel like he could probably relax.
*  I mean, I think I think the same thing that keeps me going at age 67.
*  I mean, building something is great fun.
*  Building Whole Foods, I don't I mean, I've got plenty of money, Joe.
*  I don't need to work. I just like it.
*  Do you still run Whole Foods?
*  Like, what's your relationship?
*  They're still CEO, still CEO.
*  So you still work long hours?
*  I don't work as long today as I did when I was in my 20s and 30s.
*  There's no question about it, because I was putting a lot of 80 hour weeks
*  and year after year after year after year.
*  Now you're building.
*  You know, it wasn't work. It was play.
*  Yeah, I was having a blast.
*  It was fun.
*  Elon Musk has famously said that if you're in a tech startup
*  and you're not working 120 hour weeks, you won't succeed.
*  Yeah, I never been in a tech startup, so I can't speak for that.
*  The grocery business wasn't quite that hard, but we did put a lot of 80 hour.
*  That seems like not a lot of time to sleep.
*  And I'm a great believer in sleep.
*  Sleep is like how many hours are left?
*  How many hours are in a week?
*  Well, let's see. There's 24 hours, 168 hours a week.
*  160 hours. He's only got 48 hours to sleep.
*  That is ridiculous, Elon.
*  So that's I don't know if you all you did was 48 hours.
*  Divided by seven, that's almost seven hours a night.
*  If all you did was work and sleep, I don't know when he eats.
*  Maybe you have to eat when you're
*  definitely have to eat.
*  I would recommend eating.
*  And you got to go to the bathroom sometime.
*  I got to scratch that out.
*  So you sleep seven hours a night and just stay at work.
*  Yeah, I don't actually think you have to put a lot of energy in to build anything.
*  Yes. But if you're doing it right, we talk a lot about conscious
*  capitalism is about higher purpose.
*  If you have a purpose that's animating you,
*  it doesn't feel like work. It feels like play.
*  It also attracts people to you that share that same purpose.
*  This is something that I find very frustrating in people that don't recognize
*  that it is incredibly difficult to build a successful business when they just want
*  to tax the shit out of people and take all that money.
*  Like, do you think it's easy to make something like Whole Foods?
*  Do you think it's easy to make a company like Tesla?
*  Do you think it's it's not easy?
*  It's an insanely difficult task.
*  That's why most people don't do it.
*  But when someone does do it and they have become successful,
*  then other people start looking at it and go, well, they have all this money.
*  They should contribute more or they should do this.
*  Or, you know, you're talking about
*  some people have suggested some extraordinary tax rates
*  in order to get us out of this current recession.
*  And then I talked to business people and they say that is the exact wrong approach
*  because that's actually going to stifle business and business is the only thing
*  that's going to bring us out of this.
*  If you incentivize businesses to take risks and to be open and to make more
*  profits, then more people are going to get jobs than the economy bounces back.
*  But if you give them a gigantic tax burden,
*  they're going to be less likely to take chances.
*  They're not going to be able to survive.
*  And people on the outside who've never built a business like Whole Foods,
*  they don't seem to see that.
*  They don't see it.
*  The reality is, is that
*  people like an Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos,
*  they are they're good capital allocators, so to speak.
*  They're not going to waste that money.
*  That money is going to be reinvested
*  to create new and more dynamic businesses that will help.
*  The innovations will help our society move forward.
*  When you just redistribute that money, it there's no more additional innovation.
*  It's just it's just being consumed.
*  This whole idea that it's consumption that drives the economy is fundamentally a myth.
*  It's mostly creativity and innovation that drives the economy.
*  So we need to keep that money in the hands of our most creative people,
*  which are entrepreneurs, creative business people.
*  And for some reason, I probably I think because of envy, it seems so unfair.
*  Again, we are in a win lose model.
*  If Jeff Bezos has one hundred and fifty
*  billion dollars, then that's unfair in some sort of cosmic way.
*  That's unfair.
*  And they believe that some are another others have less.
*  So there's like this fixed pie and Jeff took a big piece of it or or Elon Musk has
*  taken a big piece of it, but it's not a fixed pie.
*  That's the wrong metaphor.
*  Innovationism is continually growing the pie.
*  And in fact, humanity is demonstrably better off because of the capitalist,
*  because of the innovation.
*  Let me play devil's advocate, because this is the way they look at it.
*  They would say, well, when you get to that sort of a position like a Jeff Bezos,
*  we have one hundred and fifty billion dollars, you can exert your influence on
*  people in a way that's detrimental to society.
*  You've achieved too high of a position.
*  You have too much power and you will probably lose use that power to loosen
*  regulations, to bribe politicians or influence politicians and to get laws
*  passed that are better for your business and stifle competition.
*  I think that's a powerful argument.
*  And if and when it happens, you have to push back against you have to resist it.
*  I think most business people are not doing that.
*  I think I don't see that Jeff's trying to pass or I don't see.
*  I don't see Jeff trying to pass laws.
*  No, I don't think he is.
*  I'm not saying he is.
*  If he was, boy, would they come after him?
*  Because he's balling so hard.
*  They'd be like that motherfucker.
*  He doesn't have enough.
*  But I know that before when Whole Foods was we were a public company for 25 years
*  and we we had the government go after us a few times for they tried to stop our.
*  We tried to make an acquisition of a company called Wild Oats back in 2007.
*  We actually made the acquisition, but the FTC tried to stop it.
*  We ended up going into court with them and we actually won in court.
*  And very interesting, the FTC has their own court.
*  And after we won in the federal courts, they said, well, now we want to take you
*  into our court, the administrative court.
*  Oh, terrific. They have their own court.
*  They have their own court.
*  Don't you wish you had your own court?
*  Take you to Whole Foods court, motherfucker.
*  I'll take the FTC to the Whole Foods court.
*  Right. But, you know, the people's court.
*  You don't win in the FTC court.
*  You don't win in that court.
*  So how many people have won in that court?
*  I think when I looked at it at that time, this back in 2007, I think 46 of the 48
*  previous cases, this is from memory, so I could be wrong, had lost.
*  They should go to court.
*  So someone should take them to court.
*  But here's the thing. I asked our attorney.
*  So, OK, we're going to lose in this court, in their court.
*  Then what happens?
*  This is well, then you appeal that back to the federal courts.
*  And then after that, if they want to, they would go to the Supreme Court.
*  If they'll take it.
*  I said, how much is it going to cost me to just fight them in their own courts?
*  They said it's going to cost you 30 million dollars in legal fees,
*  not to mention a lot of executive time.
*  It's like, man, 30 million and we know we're going to lose.
*  And then we have to spend another 30
*  million dollars to go to the appeals and beyond that.
*  The lawyers love it, by the way.
*  Of course, they want you to do it like divorce lawyers.
*  Yes, exactly. They love it.
*  How people fight. You guys should not talk.
*  Don't talk. Don't try to work this out because you don't try to try to steal
*  your money. He's going to try to steal that money.
*  He's a piece of shit. Look at him. Look at him.
*  So again. So what did you do?
*  You went up settling.
*  We ended up. Yes, we ended up.
*  They let the merger go through and we agreed to sell off a bunch of stores.
*  And that was that was the best we could do.
*  How many stores you have to sell off?
*  We put up about.
*  Thirty for sale, I think, and we only about about I don't know,
*  I think five or six, we sold off five or six when someone is involved in that kind
*  of a fucked up scenario where you bring them to FTC court where no one wins.
*  If you do win, like ultimately a Supreme Court,
*  they should take it out of the salary of the people that forced you into doing that.
*  It should be worth it for you to go to war.
*  Those rich guys should make the government do that with all their power.
*  Yeah. You know, if the rich guys are so
*  powerful, how come we have such high tax rates?
*  Because you make a lot of money, but don't you shield it?
*  Didn't Donald Trump pay like 700 bucks in taxes?
*  I don't know what he paid in taxes because we never actually saw as we just heard
*  what the New York Times said he paid, but we don't really know for sure
*  because we never really saw the taxes.
*  The New York Times would never lie, but
*  of course not.
*  Isn't that funny that that's a funny thing to say now?
*  Boy, that used to be like if you said that in 1980, people would agree with you.
*  Depends on how you say it to today.
*  Well, there's a lot of dummies that think
*  the New York Times never lie today, but they've been caught lying, unfortunately.
*  There's a problem with journalism in particular today,
*  and it's that it's not just journalism now, it's a business that is sort of in a
*  very fucked up place where sensationalism is very important to the business model.
*  Yeah, the click through is to click dates.
*  It's very important.
*  It's very important.
*  Nobody's buying physical copies anymore, so they can't just rely on subscriptions.
*  Did you see that recent documentary, The Social Dilemma?
*  Yes, I did.
*  That was kind of creepy.
*  I had Tristan Harris on the podcast a couple of weeks ago.
*  Yeah, really? Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's very disturbing because you see how this all plays out.
*  And you're seeing it right now online with the election results.
*  We are.
*  Yeah.
*  Civil War.
*  It looks like we're heading to a civil war.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you have like the real wacky sections of both.
*  You know, you have the QAnons on one side and the Antifa's on the other side.
*  And it's so nuts.
*  Like it is crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy.
*  That Sidney Powell lady, she seems unhinged.
*  We'll see what she can deliver the goods or not.
*  I'm very curious to see how this all plans out or pans out rather.
*  But it just.
*  You know, it just seems like the most divided I can ever remember this country
*  being definitely in my lifetime, the most divided, which is exactly what they were
*  talking about in The Social Dilemma, and they were literally saying that what's
*  happening with these algorithms, what's happening with these echo chambers
*  that people are involved with in social media, what's happening with the way it
*  influences the mind to gravitate towards these things that upset people and to
*  rile people up and get people more and more interested in these
*  particularly polarizing subjects like we're headed towards almost like a civil war.
*  Yeah. You know,
*  of course, I do.
*  Well, I think The Social Dilemma is a good movie and a lot to learn from.
*  And I do think it overstates it.
*  And in our book Conscious Leadership,
*  we talk about cultural intelligence in the book, particularly the very last
*  part of the appendix, and we talk about how there there are three major types
*  of worldviews that exist in the United States that are clashing with each other.
*  The first one is more of a traditional worldview
*  of heritage values that that
*  might be traditional Christianity or traditional Judaism combined with
*  belief in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution,
*  sort of very traditional values.
*  And
*  and then you have the modernist worldview, which is science, rationality,
*  capitalism, success, getting ahead.
*  And that's the second.
*  And now we have a progressive worldview that hasn't been around that long.
*  But it's it's a third major worldview.
*  And I think statistically, we think about 30 percent of the population is in
*  the traditional worldview.
*  About 50 percent is in the modernist worldview and about
*  20 percent is in the progressive worldview.
*  And these all these worldviews are struggling with each other to dominate,
*  to have their values become the law of the land.
*  And everybody must conform to their values because their values are correct.
*  So that's that we think that's the essence of this cultural struggle going on.
*  And we we need and we argue in the book that there's a fourth we call
*  post-progressivism, which basically recognizes all the values have good
*  things about them and they have some bad things about them.
*  Right.
*  So they have dignities and disasters.
*  And if we're going to if we're going to get through it, we need conscious leaders
*  who will be able to take the best things about each one of these worldviews and
*  integrate them together so that we can give each of the worldviews enough to feel
*  like this is a society worth belonging to.
*  If we try to cram one set of values down
*  everybody else's throats and force that into law, we're going to have a civil war
*  because Americans are going to stand for it.
*  I like that perspective that there are good things and bad things about these
*  sides. And that's one of the things we're talking about, like that we're so polarized
*  today and something you're talking about with capitalism because you're saying,
*  hey, John, it's not perfect.
*  And capitalism is a modernistic
*  sort of part of the modernistic worldview.
*  And it's not perfect.
*  There are problems and challenges with it, but the dignities of it are tremendous.
*  And we can't throw out the baby with the bathwater just because it's not perfect,
*  because there is no perfect solution to any of these problems.
*  We're going to muddle our way through like we always do.
*  Is now when you look at the positive
*  aspects of all these different schools of thought and you look at progressivism,
*  which is the one that is probably the most on the rise today.
*  Why is it the most on the rise?
*  What do you think when you say you look at
*  you might say that you can see each of these worldviews
*  comes out of the previous worldview.
*  So if you go back 200 years ago, 250 years ago, the modernist worldview was just being
*  born, the founding fathers of our country were early modernist people like Franklin
*  and Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton.
*  These were early modernist.
*  But almost everybody else was a traditionalist and that we created the
*  foundation to create really the world's first modern society, which was the United
*  States. Now, progressivism in a way is a reaction to the disasters of modernism.
*  Like modernism does have negative environmental impacts.
*  And so part of is we have to solve those problems.
*  And so progressivism is partly a solving that problem.
*  Things like racism and
*  sexism and homophobia or whatever.
*  These are also aspects that progressivism is reacting to to say that this is not
*  fair, this is not just.
*  So the really beautiful thing about progressivism is that it's striving to
*  give dignity to all these different sort of
*  marginalized people that were always used to get beat up when they were young, so to
*  speak, in a more modernistic traditional society.
*  The problem is, is that when you begin to force your values on everybody else, then
*  then we begin to get a lot of blowback on that.
*  And that's true for progressivism as well.
*  It needs to harmonize with traditionalism
*  and modernism and not treat those as the enemies that must be conquered.
*  The things that progressivism, the things that resonate with a lot of people is the
*  uplifting of the impoverished, the education in poor communities where
*  traditionally the education has been substandard.
*  All these different things that I think
*  for whatever reason, our government or our society has we've aired.
*  There's a problem in not not not dealing with those those issues.
*  So I would I would take a little different interpretation.
*  Actually, modernism is dealing with it.
*  Modernism has been lifting humanity up, as I argued earlier.
*  OK, but it's not it's not but it's not done a great job.
*  It's actually done a very good job, but it hasn't.
*  It hasn't finished the job.
*  So progressivism is correct to recognize that there are some people being left out,
*  that the rising tide has not lifted all the boats.
*  What about those that are being left behind?
*  What about them?
*  They're absolutely right. We need to take care of them.
*  We need to find solutions to their problems.
*  But it's not by throwing modernism out.
*  Right.
*  It's not it's by taking modernism and then
*  and then adding on a greater sensitivity for those who are downtrodden, who are
*  who have bad educational systems.
*  This is where you can take some of the good aspects.
*  Exactly.
*  Progressive. Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  These are the aspects that I identify with.
*  As do I. Yeah.
*  So the ideas of progressivism when it comes to dealing with impoverished
*  communities, dealing with crime ridden communities and coming up with strategies
*  to help the people that are stuck in those spots.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  Yeah. That if you take away that once once that gets starts getting implemented
*  on a wide scale, then a lot of the arguments against capitalism are start to fade.
*  Hence conscious capitalism.
*  Is that in your book?
*  Yes, exactly.
*  That's exactly what it's about.
*  Right here by John Mackey and Rod Sosodia.
*  Available on Amazon and at Whole Foods.
*  You can get it at Whole Foods.
*  Probably Barnes and Noble.
*  Sure.
*  Dealing with this debate and dealing with this argument, has anyone or have just
*  having these conversations over long periods of time like I know you have, has
*  this shaped your perspective in any way?
*  Like having to formulate these very clear arguments?
*  Of course. Yeah.
*  I mean,
*  you can't really think clearly.
*  At least I think dialectically, Joe.
*  I need pushback.
*  I need a devil's advocate because I'm always around, bro.
*  OK. Well, you're apparently you're not always around.
*  You travel a lot.
*  I haven't been traveling that much, but
*  but you need a real devil's advocate.
*  Well, you need your ideas need to stand the test of being struggled with.
*  Right.
*  That's a real problem with people that don't want to hear the other perspective.
*  We're stuck in. That's your social dilemma issue.
*  When we get stuck in an echo chamber, if we only if you're if you're
*  traditionalist and you only watch Fox News, for example, then you're not going to get
*  a wider perspective. But if you're progressive and you only read the New
*  York Times and watch CNN and MSNBC, you may not be getting a wider perspective either.
*  We need to expose ourselves to the wider context of information that's out there.
*  That is a philosophy that I think should be taught in school that is as important
*  as mathematics and history.
*  There's there's a thing about challenging
*  ideas and looking at your own ideas in an objective way.
*  I think one of the things that I've worked
*  very hard at doing is not being married to any of the ideas that I have in my head
*  and that I don't they're not mine.
*  They are an idea.
*  And even though I have espoused these ideas, even though I've defended these ideas,
*  if something comes along that shows me that this idea is flawed or inaccurate,
*  I have made a very
*  positive, very conscious, positive effort to abandon those ideas or reexamine them.
*  I've got a metaphor for it that you you I'm happy to loan it to you.
*  You can have it, too.
*  It's like ideas are like I've got clothes on here today, but they're not who I am.
*  I'm just wearing them today.
*  And I'll put these aside and I'll wear different clothes tomorrow.
*  The clothes are not me.
*  And the ideas and beliefs I have are not me either.
*  When when they don't fit any longer,
*  I set them aside and I get new clothes that fit better.
*  And that's a that's a very liberating way to think about your beliefs and your
*  ideas, because otherwise, if you identify yourself with what you believe,
*  that means if somebody criticizes one of your beliefs,
*  many people take it as a personal attack that somehow they're saying, I don't have
*  worth because they disagree with my views.
*  No, they're just saying they don't like
*  the clothes that you're wearing, but that's not who you are.
*  So I'm not my beliefs.
*  They are just what I'm wearing for right now.
*  That's an interesting way of looking at it.
*  And I think there is a real problem with people looking at people's ideas and
*  judging them and their value as a human being based on those ideas.
*  But we do it because most people are married to their ideas.
*  And we're taught to defend our ideas to the death.
*  That these ideas are core to who you are as a person, the core to how you identify,
*  how you think of yourself.
*  It's like the matrix.
*  You got to free your mind.
*  Yeah. Free your mind.
*  Well, it's very freeing in being able to recognize you're wrong and say you're wrong.
*  It's very it's very freeing.
*  It is. And we resist it.
*  But when you resist it and you know you're wrong, you feel like a loser.
*  Like inside your head, you know you're full of shit.
*  You know, I don't I don't experience it that way.
*  So one of the things I try to do,
*  see your whole foods market is I always try to admit my mistakes in a very public
*  way because I feel like that helps everybody else admit their own mistakes.
*  Yeah. And I'll just say, you know, I was wrong about that.
*  I made a mistake. I'm sorry about that.
*  And because then if you admit you made a mistake, you can learn from it.
*  You don't have to make the same mistake again.
*  And it also gives everybody permission.
*  If John is going to admit his mistakes, then I can admit my mistakes, too.
*  And you have a much more open dialogue with people.
*  Nobody seen as infallible as all knowing is never right.
*  Always right. Never wrong.
*  Yeah, that's a great philosophy.
*  It's very important.
*  I mean, nobody wants a dictator that they have to walk on eggshells around.
*  And, you know, they have to pretend that this person is only making good decisions
*  when you think that, I mean, that's the argument against Donald Trump.
*  Right. I mean, never says he's wrong, never admits he's wrong, doesn't show any empathy.
*  I'm not going to defend Trump.
*  How dare you?
*  I will merely say that which presidents in our lifetime ever admit they made any mistakes.
*  I just that's just not something I see politicians do very often.
*  Well, Governor Newsom made a mistake when he went to that restaurant.
*  And he admitted it when he got busted.
*  Well, only when he got busted and he couldn't you couldn't deny your own.
*  Who are you going to believe what I say are your own eyes?
*  So well, then he lied, though.
*  He said he was outside. Right.
*  He didn't anticipate photos coming out after he gave that.
*  And he didn't know how many people were going to be there.
*  Yeah. And he says, I should have just turned around right then and there.
*  So you knew who was going to be there.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows? Who knows?
*  His buddy.
*  I guess when you're caught red handed, it's hard to continue to.
*  Well, look, I'm not the governor.
*  But if someone says Joe Rogan for governor, I think it's a great idea.
*  I like our governor. I like Governor Abbott.
*  I like I like Governor Abbott, too.
*  When you go to a party, if someone says we're going to have a party over my house
*  during times of covid, I'd be like, how many people are going to be there?
*  That'd be like one of the first questions I ask.
*  Like, I don't I don't want to go to a party where there's 500 people.
*  I don't know anybody. Of course not.
*  Breathing everybody's funky air.
*  I would ask that I'm not even the governor.
*  I'm not even telling people you have to close their businesses.
*  And I would ask that.
*  Forget about looking hypocritical just for my own health.
*  You know, the Newsome example, though, is a is a kind of a personal example.
*  You know, we always are quick to point out hypocrisy in people.
*  But I'm saying that very seldom do you ever see a
*  politician or a president or a senator or governor admit they made a policy mistake.
*  Right.
*  So you don't see Governor Cuomo in New York saying that, gosh, I should never
*  send those people to the nursing homes.
*  I really made a mistake. Good point.
*  We don't see the obvious mistakes ever admitted.
*  Don't you think that in that situation there would be a legal problem?
*  Because if he did admit that that's a mistake publicly,
*  they would probably sue the shit out of him.
*  You're talking about they could still sue him whether he admitted or not.
*  But they would have the evidence.
*  They would have his own his own testimony publicly.
*  That he made a mistake.
*  You would not be able to argue against that.
*  Look, clear. I think we both agree.
*  Good point. Clearly he made a mistake.
*  That's a giant mistake.
*  And it's responsible for thousands of deaths.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's going to it's hard to argue that you take people that are covid positive,
*  you send them to a nursing home where folks are older and their immune systems
*  are compromised and a lot of them die.
*  I mean, I don't know what number died,
*  but I know that there have been reports in places where there have been covid
*  deaths where an enormous percentage of them were nursing homes.
*  More than 20 percent.
*  Oh, no, no, Joe.
*  I think it's over 50 percent.
*  The United States are close to it.
*  And I mean, 95 percent have comorbidities.
*  Right.
*  So imagine being in that situation where you're an older person and you're just
*  like trying to ride out your last days and the governor sends sick people back
*  to the nursing home and you realize that Mary down the hall is coughing up a fucking
*  storm now.
*  I mean,
*  we're way out of where I'm kind of a little bit out of my comfort zone.
*  That's what I like to do to people.
*  I know.
*  But we don't know what really what what the governor might have been thinking.
*  I believe his intentions were probably good.
*  He was very worried they were going to be they were going to have too many cases.
*  They weren't going to have enough hospital beds for it.
*  No, I'm sure it's probably a mistake, but it was it was it was made with good
*  intentions and I don't think it was made with bad intentions to hurt people.
*  I don't think so either.
*  I don't think he did it to try to kill old people.
*  Exactly.
*  I think he just made an error.
*  Actually trying to save lives.
*  He just made a mistake.
*  Well, and people make mistakes when you're in a situation like that where
*  there's not much you can do when you are stuck.
*  You know, I was talking to a nurse and she was explained to me she's a nurse in
*  a covid ward and she was explaining to me the decisions that they have to make.
*  She's like during like the peak when when it was, you know, all the beds were full.
*  She's like, we really were in situations where we're like, we have to send this
*  person home and they're going to die and there's no room for for new people to
*  come in, so we literally have to send.
*  We have to take people that are terminal triage.
*  Yeah, there's not much you could do.
*  And I go, well, what how do you protect their family from getting it?
*  She's like, you can't like, oh, my God.
*  So you're sending people who are dying
*  of covid home and they were likely going to infect their family.
*  You know, you tell their family, take all the precautions.
*  They can. But if you have to do it, you have to do it.
*  That's when you're in a situation where there's no good.
*  That's not a win win.
*  Right.
*  That's not a win win win either.
*  No.
*  Yeah, it's it's hugely unfortunate, but it's also unprecedented.
*  Right. Like when Mario Cuomo became governor or Andrew Cuomo rather became
*  governor, he didn't think that this was something that he was going to have to
*  encounter. He probably had strategies in play for economic growth, for, you know,
*  dealing with law enforcement, all these different problems that a governor would
*  face, taxes, all these different things, and probably never thought, oh, there might
*  be a thing that kills all these old people if I send them back to nursing homes.
*  I'm sure there was not a plan for it.
*  Well, that's one thing about this.
*  That's why I never want to be governor, Joe.
*  Please don't. Everybody hate you.
*  I think they hate you when you became successful with whole paycheck.
*  Wait, wait to know.
*  Wait till I'm governor. Yeah. Oh, my God.
*  Well, and then if you become president, it's even worse than literally half the
*  country hates you.
*  Look how many people are trying to kill you.
*  Yeah. I don't.
*  As far as I know, I don't have anybody trying to kill me.
*  Congratulations.
*  This is probably like one butcher is thinking this.
*  You're you're you're time doing this, your time spent
*  like as a leader, as you know, do you understand better the pitfalls of these
*  leaders because of the fact that you've been a leader of corporations?
*  Absolutely. Absolutely.
*  You just have a lot of responsibility.
*  And if you're a leader, you're also being paid to make good decisions.
*  And if you make good decisions, a lot of people benefit.
*  And if you make bad decisions, a lot of people might suffer.
*  So you got to have a high batting average here, Joe.
*  You can't you're going to make a few mistakes, but you you make those mistakes,
*  hopefully at a smaller level, not at the biggest level.
*  And
*  I've made plenty of mistakes at Whole Foods.
*  And one of the reasons I've been successful is I've just learned from a lot
*  of my mistakes, so I say I have a lot of scars and but they've made me better, too.
*  Now, when you do have these very strong
*  ethics and morals that you operate your company by, but you're also
*  you're incentivized by profit.
*  Do you make a conscious effort to explain
*  or to espouse these ideas to the people that are working for you and working?
*  Absolutely. We do.
*  I mean,
*  our quality standards, our core values, our higher purpose, these are all we
*  actually have a program in Whole Foods now called Cultural Champions, where people
*  go through a program and get certified to be a cultural champion.
*  And it's very important because we have a hundred thousand people working for
*  Whole Foods and every year we're hiring ten to twenty thousand new people.
*  Exactly.
*  And so they're not going to know the purpose.
*  They're not going to the core values.
*  They're not going to know what the company is about or even they're not going to
*  know the history. You have to help.
*  You have to continually educate and teach people who you are, what you stand for.
*  Otherwise, it's going to disappear.
*  One thing you guys have done, and I don't know how you did it.
*  A lot of people, they are friendly.
*  Like, how have you done that?
*  Like in Boulder, I found people to be friendly.
*  I found people to be friendly in Park City, Utah.
*  I found people to be friendly in Los Angeles, in the valley, in the city.
*  Like you've got a lot of friendly employees.
*  Is this something that's been like a core tenant of the business?
*  It is. It's one of our core values.
*  We call it
*  team member growth and happiness.
*  We actually want our people working for us to be happy.
*  And I'll tell you what I've learned.
*  There's two things that people want at work above all else.
*  I mean, they want to earn a paycheck, too.
*  But besides, if you get the money right,
*  there's two things that people want,
*  which will make them long term committed to your organization.
*  The first one is everybody wants to have a sense of purpose.
*  They want to feel like their work is actually contributing.
*  It's you know, they're not just making widgets.
*  They're doing something that's actually creating value for other people.
*  Purpose matters.
*  And secondly, they want to feel like somebody gives a shit about them,
*  that they're cared for, that that that.
*  And if you do those two things, if you give people purpose and love,
*  then you're giving them probably the two things they most desire in life,
*  is purpose and love. And we try to do that at Whole Foods.
*  And to the degree people are friendly,
*  it's partly because they're experiencing both of those or at least one of them.
*  What's great about that to me is that because your business has been so
*  successful and it's such a popular spot for people and people are very aware that
*  it's like that, my hope is that this is going to be
*  contagious and that other businesses are going to go, you know,
*  we're going to follow the Whole Foods model and we are going to create an
*  environment where it's family, people are loved, they're cared for.
*  And then the people that come there, we want them to be appreciated.
*  We want everybody who works for us to be happy that they have a job here,
*  feel like they belong, feel like they're doing something good.
*  I absolutely agree.
*  The second chapter of our book, Conscious Leadership, is lead with love.
*  Love is something that we don't think about in our corporations.
*  And we have these sort of hyper competitive models,
*  mental models about the way the world works.
*  They're war metaphors, kill or be killed.
*  We're going to let's go to the war room.
*  Let's let's create our campaign.
*  Let's go motivate the troops.
*  We're using war metaphors or we're using
*  Darwinian metaphors.
*  This is survival of the fittest.
*  It's a jungle out there.
*  Only the paranoid survive.
*  Or they are sports metaphors where we're winners,
*  losers, and winning isn't
*  everything. It's the only thing.
*  We've got this idea of hyper competition.
*  And when you're at war, there really isn't any place for love.
*  I mean, love, check it at the door because we got a war to fight.
*  Well, after that. So do that in your personal life.
*  And love, though, the love.
*  I don't mean romantic love.
*  I don't mean sexual love.
*  I mean the love that you feel towards the people you're working with,
*  the people that you're serving, your customers.
*  That can't that that's part of the most important part of being a human being.
*  We have to bring that part with us to work.
*  It can't hide out in the closet.
*  We have to be able to connect with people.
*  And.
*  That's one of the great things that we need to have happen in corporations.
*  If you're asking how can we make corporations better?
*  Cindy Powell's talking about release the crack.
*  And I'd say, is that what she said?
*  That's what she's been saying.
*  I would say, let's release love.
*  Let's let love out of the closet.
*  Let's let love be what we build our organizations around.
*  It's so much better way to live.
*  The only argument, I would say,
*  against that would be that you don't love your competitors.
*  You're out there to kick their ass, right?
*  If you're playing on a team and you're
*  supposed to go up against another team, you want to be as amped up, as aggressive,
*  as motivated and as focused on victory as possible.
*  That's why so many corporations adopt these sports metaphors.
*  Right. Yeah. But that's the reality is that
*  it's not that competition is not part of corporations or business.
*  It is. Is it the main part?
*  It actually isn't.
*  The main part is about creating value for customers.
*  That's why the business exists.
*  Competitors and you.
*  I never hated any of my competitors.
*  I mean, I always saw my competitors as people that could teach me things,
*  things they were doing better than Whole Foods was doing.
*  Like one of the best competitors Whole Foods
*  competes against anywhere in the whole world is H.E.B. here in Texas.
*  Very, very good competitor.
*  And we've learned a lot from H.E.B.
*  They've made us better as a company.
*  And the words you learn from H.E.B.
*  What have we learned from H.E.B.
*  If I was to be specific about how to hire sketchy late night people.
*  No.
*  Well, H.E.B. opened up a concept called Central Market.
*  And that was back in the early 1990s.
*  And it was took a lot of Whole Foods' ideas and expanded and made in bigger stores.
*  So one thing I learned from H.E.B. was to do bigger stores.
*  And and we started getting progressively bigger stores.
*  Central Market joints are pretty nice.
*  They are. They are.
*  They are worthy competitor.
*  And so our competitors can be our allies in the sense that they help us improve.
*  How if you don't have a good competitor, then you're not going to be pushed.
*  Look, take one of my favorite sports, tennis.
*  We happen to be blessed with possibly the three greatest tennis players of all time
*  playing at the same exact time, Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and
*  Novic Djivovic and 2020 and 18 Masters Grand Slam championships.
*  Those three guys are the top three of all time in Grand Slam championships.
*  If.
*  If they didn't have the other two,
*  they wouldn't be the same player they turned out to be, because that pushed them
*  to get better and better and better.
*  And by the way, that is the beauty of capitalism versus socialism.
*  There is competition.
*  There is innovation that's occurring that you have to you have to stay on top of.
*  You have to incorporate yourself and then you have to challenge to out innovate
*  the other people to stay ahead, so to speak.
*  And socialism doesn't have that incentive to innovate.
*  And that's why it stagnates in the long run.
*  So competition is part of business.
*  I don't want to say it's not there.
*  It's just not the most important part.
*  It's not it shouldn't dominate everything else.
*  It has its place, but it shouldn't be the be all reality of business.
*  And all be all. Yeah, I understand what you're saying.
*  And I agree with you in terms of competition.
*  Obviously, you know, I come from a martial arts background and that's everything.
*  If you don't have people in the gym that are better than you,
*  you will not get better.
*  You don't want to be the man like you want to be surrounded
*  by other people that are better than you.
*  It's almost always the best way to improve
*  and grow because you have a metric to gauge yourself by.
*  You can compare against them and you also can study them.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, how are they doing that?
*  How are they doing that sidekick that keeps hitting me?
*  They show you.
*  One of the beautiful things about martial arts, it's always been the case.
*  Martial artists are very open, collaborative.
*  Yes, very collaborative because that's taught like from the beginning,
*  particularly in jujitsu and jujitsu, there's no secrets.
*  Like everyone is trying to show you what they're doing.
*  Like one of my best friends is Eddie Bravo,
*  who's a world renowned jujitsu instructor and competitor.
*  And he he's like, I am teaching my students how to beat me.
*  He goes, I'm getting these younger, faster, stronger people.
*  I'm showing them all my tricks and that makes me stay one step ahead.
*  And this is like this is the philosophy of martial arts.
*  It's very you.
*  You never want to have no competition.
*  That's a terrible place to be.
*  It's the philosophy of excellence.
*  Yeah.
*  And excellence is a big part of corporations and it's a big part of capitalism.
*  Yeah, it's a big part of everything.
*  But when you actually go to a competition, you want to smash that person.
*  You want to love them.
*  Yeah, but you may be loving them after the competition.
*  Yes.
*  Might be your best friend.
*  I mean, it's a friendly competition.
*  You're not literally trying to kill them.
*  Right.
*  You're not really wanting to to to them to crack their head and they never get up.
*  This is a concept, this concept that we're describing,
*  whether it applies to martial arts or to business, that a socialist would have a
*  very difficult time grasping that you can both be loving and ultra competitive
*  and that these things are not mutually exclusive.
*  And in fact, they help.
*  It helps.
*  They are yin and yang.
*  Yeah, they they they work well together.
*  So this is if I'm I'm going to put words in your mouth.
*  This is probably one of the things that
*  frustrates you the most about these ideas, these progressive ideas,
*  is that they when they apply them to business, they don't really understand
*  business, they don't work. Yeah, they don't work.
*  That's the problem.
*  And that is the disaster of progressivism.
*  You mean the people don't work or the ideas don't work.
*  The ideas don't work.
*  But the ideas are a great example is collective agriculture.
*  You know, we're going to put everybody we're not going to do individual farming
*  plots, we're going to China almost put it starve itself to death.
*  And you had millions and millions of people die from starvation by
*  collectivizing the agriculture, even though the Soviet Union had already failed to do it.
*  So China did it and they forced all the people to collectivize their agriculture.
*  And the result the result was terrible idea because they didn't have the incentives
*  that were there any longer to try to optimize their production.
*  And as a result, a starvation mass starvation occurred until China wised up.
*  They had finally some communists said,
*  let's let them own at least a small little plot themselves, that they get to keep
*  what they produce for their families.
*  And that proved to be so productive it gradually took over the entire agriculture.
*  They went back to capitalism and agriculture in China.
*  So wasn't that the issue with the colonists as well in America when they first started
*  growing wheat, they combined all their food together.
*  And then they realized, like, hey, this is not working.
*  We have to make people earn their own.
*  You know, I think one of the reasons this idea will always be there, Joe,
*  is that's how we operate our families.
*  When we're growing up, we're just small kids.
*  The family shares. Right.
*  And you're
*  and then we ask when we get older, why can't we make the whole society like the family?
*  And the answer is because it's too damn big to do it that way.
*  And when you try to do it that way, you get you get the slackers and the people
*  that don't want to work being parasites on the others.
*  And you end up with the free rider problem.
*  And ultimately, that's the problem with
*  socialism is a free rider problem that they've never been able to solve for,
*  except through coercion and putting people in labor camps and things like that,
*  turn them into slaves so they can't solve that problem except by by by sort of super
*  coercion, and that's why it doesn't work, why it's never going to work and why
*  capitalism with all its flaws is a system that does work that we can make better.
*  We can make more conscious.
*  We can do it better than we're doing it.
*  What do you think about the concept of universal basic income?
*  Yeah, I, you know, no, I mean, I don't think that's a good idea.
*  But when you have a situation like a
*  pandemic where so many people through no fault of their own are being forced out
*  of work, they cannot work.
*  That isn't that temporary situation.
*  But isn't that a good argument for universal basic income, at least for a
*  temporary situation? Well, when people are sick, they need to be taken care of.
*  When they're healthy, they know you'd be taken care of.
*  They need to stand on their own two feet.
*  Right. But when you have a situation where
*  they can't stand on their own two feet because they're literally not allowed to
*  work like California, I mean, California, they're they're just they're right now
*  shutting down restaurants that serve outside.
*  Yeah. Well, I mean,
*  the alternative is not to shut down the economy.
*  No, listen, I agree.
*  But there's a lot of people that they get really hysterical about this.
*  And they think this is the only way we're going to save people.
*  There's a lot of people out there with terrible health.
*  And they think that what we need to do is shut everything down.
*  And that's the only way we're going to be safe.
*  I was reading this woman's Twitter the other day.
*  I just someone said something ridiculous.
*  And I'm like, oh, my God, I need to check this person out.
*  And they were talking about, hey, you know,
*  I am ready to lock everything down for five weeks.
*  I don't go outside. I stay away from everybody.
*  I order my groceries delivered.
*  I'm ready to lock down for five weeks.
*  I'm like, this is the most simplistic and individual perception of this problem,
*  that everyone should do what you're capable of doing.
*  And most people can't do this if they have a fucking business.
*  Like they can't. I'm ready to lock down for five weeks.
*  Well, congratulations to you.
*  But some guy who runs some whatever,
*  figure out whatever store it is or whatever kind of business,
*  they need to be there in order to be open to stay to stay alive.
*  There's no other way to keep that business alive.
*  They have rent. They have overhead.
*  They have they have employees.
*  Do you know, you know, the history of the 1918, 1919 influenza epidemic?
*  That's the worst pandemic that we know of in our modern history.
*  That's only 100 years ago.
*  And.
*  50 million people died worldwide.
*  I mean, how many people died worldwide in Covid?
*  A couple million at this point, and the population was four times greater than.
*  They didn't shut anything down back then.
*  What do you mean the population was four times greater than?
*  It's four times greater now.
*  And then it was one twenty five percent.
*  One point eight billion people back a hundred years ago across the world.
*  So you could scale that up pretty, pretty largely.
*  Exactly.
*  And that was a killer that didn't just take people with comorbidities.
*  It took children. It took healthy adults.
*  It was nondiscriminatory disease.
*  And we took precautions, people, you know, social distanced.
*  But at the end of the day,
*  the economy did not shut down.
*  Humanity went on with their lives.
*  And this is not nearly the same type of pandemic that we had back then.
*  It's it's very interesting the time
*  that we live in, the reaction that we're having today to Covid being so very
*  different than the reaction we had to the influenza epidemic of 1918 and 1919,
*  which was far more destructive.
*  It's it's I don't know.
*  It's just food for thought. It's very interesting.
*  Well, what was the difference?
*  What's the difference in the reaction of today versus the reaction from 1918?
*  The reaction back then was
*  individual responsibility to to do what was necessary to protect yourself
*  and your family. But other than that, life went on.
*  And there was no governmental,
*  not nearly the same level of they had mask mandates, though, didn't they?
*  If you if you go back and read about it,
*  not any kind of national type of mass mandate, certain small communities did it.
*  It was just all so much smaller in scale.
*  I didn't even know they wore masks.
*  We've been looking at it because we were looking at a lot of photos from
*  back in the day. It's kind of crazy to see because they did.
*  Yeah. I mean, people were scared and they wanted to protect themselves and their
*  family and they did what they thought was necessary.
*  It's just interesting how much different we're reacting to this one to me.
*  And we are we are doing great, great harm.
*  And we don't see the harm that we're doing.
*  We don't see the small businesses failing,
*  the suicide rates going up, the domestic violence, the isolation,
*  the mental or emotional health problems people have by not being able to connect
*  with each other, not being able to physically touch the kids that are missing
*  out in school and in person that speaking as a as a man who was once a little boy,
*  little boys need to they need to play.
*  They also need to connect.
*  They need they need they can't just watch a screen.
*  Yeah. Kids I have they need to be more interactive.
*  Two kids in school right now.
*  And it's soul sucking watching them stare at a laptop.
*  And then I sat in in my daughter's room
*  once and watched the teacher teach the class.
*  And Jesus Christ, this lady could have not been less motivated.
*  It was horrible to watch.
*  Yeah. Motivating or motivated.
*  They're they're they're lazy.
*  Well, hopefully these vaccinations are
*  are going to be as effective as they're reporting and will not have side effects
*  and that that a year from now will be this will be in the rearview mirror.
*  Are you going to wait? You're going to dive right in.
*  What if Jeff Bezos calls you up and says, hey, John,
*  I got the vaccine.
*  I come over.
*  You know, I haven't decided yet.
*  I've had to do four covid tests, including one today to get in here.
*  You only had four. How many of you had?
*  Oh, my God. I don't even know.
*  Well, you do it every time you come in here.
*  Yes, right. It's we were trying to figure it out.
*  I remember I counted like 50 something of them.
*  But you've done over 50. Oh, way more than.
*  So you'll be an early adapter of the of the vaccination just so you don't have
*  to do the damn test in.
*  I want to wait and see what's going on.
*  But if if it's proven that doesn't have any side effects and how the fuck are you
*  going to do that? It might take a few years to know that for sure.
*  Yeah. Can you wait?
*  I don't know, man. It's like I'm kind of a vaccination guy, to be honest.
*  I've had I've had all the vaccinations I have as well.
*  You can imagine. I think those.
*  And here's the thing about vaccines, man.
*  Like if you even have a conversation about vaccines, people get their hackles up.
*  What are you about to say?
*  What are you saying? Are you an anti-vaxxer?
*  Not an anti-vaxxer by any stretch of the imagination.
*  I've been vaccinated. My children have been vaccinated.
*  I believe in vaccines.
*  I believe vaccines are the reason why we don't have smallpox, right?
*  Why wouldn't have polio?
*  When I hear about measles cases rising, I get angry because these fucking hippies
*  don't want to vaccinate their kids and they send them to school with other
*  people's kids and these people get fucking measles.
*  It's and for adults, it's dangerous.
*  Right. Look, measles is a creepy disease.
*  I believe in vaccines.
*  However, I believe that this is a new thing.
*  Did you have measles?
*  I don't think I ever got because I'm older than you.
*  I had measles. I don't know.
*  I had I had all those diseases because there were no vaccines.
*  I had chickenpox. I had measles.
*  Yeah, I had almost all that stuff.
*  I mean, when I was a kid, there was no polio vaccination.
*  Oh, my God. I know.
*  So when polio was running around in the community, they closed the swimming pools
*  down. That's when my mother would not let us go out and play for a while.
*  Polio is an excellent example of why vaccines are so important,
*  exactly because it was a terrifying disease that destroyed people and permanently.
*  I know. And when I was a kid, we would when someone
*  have chickenpox, they would bring kids to that person's house.
*  So you would get chickenpox because if you get chickenpox as a young kid,
*  it's better than if you get chickenpox as an adult.
*  I do not know why.
*  But they would they would encourage kids to get chickenpox.
*  You build up an immunity to.
*  Yeah. My wife had shingles recently, so I went and got a shingles vaccination.
*  Oh, my goodness. Yeah, that's supposed to be horrible.
*  Yeah, it was horrible.
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, I believe in vaccines, but I also believe that you're not going to be a guinea pig.
*  No, there's people that have already done that.
*  There's brave folks that have already decided to get shot up.
*  Yeah, but you want your friends to do it.
*  You want your friends to say, I did it.
*  I feel fine. Everything's great.
*  No, I don't want that either.
*  What do you want?
*  I want them to assure me that it's not going to be devastating in terms of the side effects.
*  I would hate to have encouraged people to take something and then find out two years
*  from now that there's some residual side effect that's devastating.
*  Some neurological thing.
*  Your liver is starting to fail.
*  Who knows what it could be?
*  And the way it's been described to me, that won't be the case.
*  The way it's been described to me by doctors,
*  that's an unfound fear because of what this is, a messenger RNA vaccine, that this is not the type of vaccine that you,
*  it's just essentially delivering your body this sort of message that encoded with common cold virus,
*  that what it does is it makes your body develop the proteins to fight off the disease.
*  Sounds like these are vaccination breakthroughs.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  It might transform vaccinations in the future.
*  I hope so.
*  Listen, I hope so too.
*  Look, I think modern medicine is amazing.
*  I do worry about stuff, though.
*  Look, I don't want to make a mistake and I don't think you do either.
*  And when it comes to a virus...
*  I already admitted to making lots of mistakes, but this is not one I want to add to my repertoire.
*  When it comes to this virus, though, it's so difficult to be confident one way or another.
*  If it was a virus that just you go, oh, you'll survive.
*  Ninety nine point whatever percent of the people survive.
*  You're going to be fine.
*  There's people that are these.
*  This is what gets me.
*  These long haulers, COVID long haulers who have serious...
*  Like there's a guy named Cody Garbrandt.
*  He's a former Bannon Way champion of the UFC.
*  He got COVID in August.
*  He's a young stud.
*  He's a healthy guy, like a top flight mixed martial arts fighter.
*  And he has had blood clots.
*  He's had some serious problems and fatigue and still bothering him
*  to this day. He was supposed to compete last weekend.
*  It's just this past weekend.
*  He's supposed to fight for the flyweight title and he could not.
*  He couldn't make the card.
*  So they got a replacement for him.
*  But it's because of COVID.
*  If you want to look at like young, healthy people, that is one of the best
*  examples you ever get of a young, healthy person.
*  He's a professional cage fighter.
*  I mean, he's really fucking healthy.
*  But COVID has done a number on him.
*  Like he's got like some pretty serious issues.
*  Yeah, and certainly I don't want to get COVID myself.
*  But the reality is pretty much you could have anecdotes for any type of disease.
*  As somebody that had a bad reaction to that disease.
*  But that's a rare one. Right.
*  Blood clots and the stuff that people
*  fatigue months and months later for a coronavirus.
*  That is it's unusual.
*  And that's the problem is that this well, this disease has so many unknowns to it.
*  It's there's so many mysteries.
*  So many people get it and they don't even know they had it.
*  So it seems now that, you know, mono,
*  which a lot of people get when they're teenagers, it turns out that has the
*  connection to Epstein Barr. So I know people that had mono when they
*  were kids or teenagers, and now as adults, they have this Epstein
*  Barr, which is attacking their thyroid.
*  So that virus never went away.
*  It's still there. It's still affecting them.
*  And it's the reality of of existence.
*  There are all these viruses out there.
*  I mean, like I think a gallon of of seawater has 10 billion viruses in it.
*  I mean, it's it's that we live in a universe of viruses and billion.
*  Yeah. And a gallon.
*  I think it's even less than a gallon.
*  Isn't that extraordinary?
*  Viruses are real little those mass people where those viruses, you know,
*  unless you got the N95s and plexiglass, chances are that little piece of cloth
*  is not keeping the virus.
*  One of the things that freaks me out,
*  like when people dive in a lake somewhere and they get some brain eating amoeba.
*  So you know, this drop of seawater,
*  a surface drop, one drops got 10 billion, 10 million, 10 million.
*  That's why I got my gallon.
*  My gallon. My. Yeah.
*  That's a lot of viruses.
*  Don't be drinking that sea water drop
*  10 million for a fucking drop.
*  What do you do when you get a mouthful of seawater?
*  You just look.
*  Here's the good news.
*  Where we deal with viruses.
*  We got amazing immune systems and we've been
*  all co-evolving with viruses for hundreds of thousands of years.
*  Sure.
*  And guess what? We're co-evolving with covid now.
*  Yeah. Well, this has been my frustration
*  the entire time that there's been no discussion about strengthening your immune
*  system. There's legitimate strategies, including eating healthy foods.
*  All right.
*  I mean, there's legitimate strategy strategies for keeping your body healthy
*  and strong and keeping your immune system strong.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, that's interesting, Joe, because I've watched my friends
*  during the eight or nine months we've been dealing with this stuff,
*  maybe almost nine months.
*  They tended to go one of two directions.
*  One was to say, you know what?
*  I'm going to get this. I'm locked down.
*  I'm going to get super healthy.
*  I'm going to eat right. I'm going to exercise.
*  I'm going to get enough sleep.
*  I'm going to stop taking as many toxins.
*  And they got healthier.
*  They lost weight. Their immune system got strong.
*  And then I had other friends.
*  They were isolated.
*  They felt lonely.
*  Their their consumption of alcohol went way up, for example.
*  And they and they gained weight and their immune system is less strong.
*  So humans respond differently to stress like this.
*  Yeah.
*  I went the route of saying my best chance to hold off Covid is to get my immune
*  system as strong as possible.
*  I went that route.
*  Yeah. Well, that's the that's the right route to go.
*  So that's the route you better go if you own whole foods.
*  Yeah, it's going to be I always say that
*  won't be good for my business if I die of a heart attack.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  At least not for another 25 or 30 years.
*  You kind of have to be healthy.
*  There'll be a lot of people that will secretly laugh if I do croak from something
*  like that. It's like see a lifetime of eating all that healthy food.
*  And he died at a young age.
*  Do you practice what you preach?
*  Are you a healthy eater or do you have like a few bad habits?
*  I don't think I have any bad habits, but I
*  do occasionally indulge myself.
*  But you said it's a habit.
*  OK, indulge with
*  probably.
*  I mean, occasionally might have a bowl of coconut ice cream.
*  That's it.
*  Coconut ice cream.
*  That's how you go crazy.
*  I didn't say go crazy.
*  I said, indulge myself.
*  But in general, I mean, I lose, you know, I'm I'm 100 percent plant based guy.
*  So and I eat lots of fruits.
*  That's why you give me that fake cheese.
*  You one of those.
*  It's not fake cheese.
*  It's almond cheese.
*  I call it cheese.
*  Cheese is a dairy product.
*  Who says I do?
*  OK, well, I'll yield forever.
*  Cheese has been a dairy product.
*  There's cheese that's made from dairy cows.
*  What about sheep cheese or goat cheese?
*  Yeah, it's still animals from milk.
*  So from milk.
*  OK, it's coming from animals.
*  This is almond cheese coming from almonds.
*  Yeah, but that's like almond water or almond milk.
*  Almond milk is almond milk.
*  It's not some weird shit you're doing with water and almonds.
*  There's nothing to do with milk.
*  There's no tits on almonds.
*  Come on, bro.
*  I think you can if you look it up in the dictionary, you will not see cheese saying
*  it must have tits to be.
*  No, but it's a milk product.
*  You need to come up with a new name.
*  I'm happy for it to come up with a different name.
*  Someone needs to come up with a better name.
*  I don't believe in the word police.
*  Language,
*  language evolves sort of organically, so to speak.
*  New words get added all the time.
*  Right.
*  And I don't believe in the police that are trying to say that word can't be said.
*  I understand.
*  So if you're a full plant based guy, you don't need any meat at all.
*  No. Even when you're drunk.
*  No.
*  You hesitated.
*  That's what people do.
*  If I'm really drunk, I may not remember.
*  Well, you know, that's the thing.
*  They say that like 84 percent of vegans eat meat when they're drunk.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you ever hear the one I made that number up?
*  I know that 93.6 percent of the people make up their own statistics.
*  I think it's 100 percent.
*  The the thing about plant based diets is you got to really make sure that you're
*  supplementing correctly, right?
*  You have to make sure you have a good,
*  healthy supply of B12 and all your different.
*  I think B12 is the only one you really have to worry about.
*  The only one with about amino acids.
*  What about proteins?
*  You ever heard anybody being deficient in protein?
*  It's not also calorie deficient.
*  Well, by deficient, meaning the reaction to their body or their bodies optimized.
*  I would say no. Yeah.
*  I mean, yes, I have seen it because people they lose body mass.
*  They lose muscle mass.
*  They lose strength and vitality.
*  And I think you probably know that muscle
*  mass and body mass strength is directly connected to longevity.
*  You have to have enough protein so your body can repair itself so that if you're
*  lifting weights, you're going to grow muscles.
*  You have to have enough.
*  You have to have adequate protein stores.
*  But the extra protein, your body has to then go through complicated
*  reactions to convert that into fuel, which actually puts the stress on the kidneys.
*  On average, Americans eat about twice as much protein as they actually need.
*  You're talking about glucogenesis.
*  Like when you're taking protein and converting it into sugar,
*  when you're damaging to the kidneys, has been real evidence that shows that.
*  You can do a search on it. Yeah, I have.
*  I don't think there is.
*  It's actually a natural progression when you're eating meat.
*  If you're like this, people that are on meat only diets and their body produces
*  its own glucose. I mean, I think you'll
*  hate to get into debate.
*  You're getting this weird plant based debate.
*  Plant based people get real edgy when you start talking about their
*  diets. I'm not going to get really edgy about it.
*  Hey, I've got my book there for you, The Whole Foods Diet.
*  Take a look at it. Take a look at it.
*  So you allow plants on this. Where's your stakes?
*  We actually allow in that particular diet, we allow up to 10 percent of your
*  calories from animals. Oh, you allow it.
*  Do you did you always eat plant based or did you slowly gravitate towards it?
*  I was vegetarian in my early 20s and then I added fish.
*  And then back in 2003, I became 100 percent plant based.
*  But for ethical reasons, I think that's why in the book, The Whole Foods Diet,
*  we allow ethics aside.
*  We think a little bit of animal food is consistent with good health,
*  primarily based on mollusks.
*  One of the things that I've heard about mollusks is they're so primitive.
*  They're actually more primitive than plants.
*  I don't know if they're more primitive than plants, but they don't have well
*  developed nervous systems, so they may not be able to experience pain.
*  As we know it, like we as far as we know, plants respond to stimulation,
*  but don't have any evidence they experience pain.
*  Well, the idea is that mollusks might be consistent with ethical veganism.
*  I've heard that argument said very well in that not only that, but you could
*  they're sustainable, you can harvest them and grow them and that
*  their nervous system is set up so they're moving in some way,
*  like they close their shells and open their shells, but not in the sense that you
*  wouldn't consider them an animal, but you can get animal protein from them.
*  By the way, really, we're talking about things like, to be clear,
*  we're talking about things like clams, oysters.
*  Because I think like an octopus, we're not talking about an octopus.
*  Those are super intelligent.
*  They're creepy intelligent.
*  Ever see them open jars?
*  They spin the jar.
*  No, but did you see that documentary that's just come out recently
*  called My Octopus Teacher?
*  No. Oh, oh my God, it's fantastic.
*  You should watch that show.
*  There is a great Instagram handle to follow.
*  Is it OctoNation?
*  Is that what it is?
*  I think it's OctoNation.
*  See if you can find it.
*  Do you know what that one I'm talking about?
*  There's a fantastic Instagram page that just they're in love with octopus
*  and octopi, and they're constantly highlighting all the cool things about
*  octopus, particularly their ability to camouflage themselves and hide.
*  Oh, they're amazing.
*  I just was diving just a few weeks ago.
*  Look at this. Look at that thing.
*  Oh my God.
*  They can change their colors.
*  They're so cool.
*  They're one of the coolest animals on the planet.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  They're so strange.
*  Like my friend Remy Warren, he used to have a television show called Apex
*  Predator, where he would basically study all these predators and their
*  the methods that they use to hunt.
*  And he studied octopus.
*  And he's like, they're aliens.
*  They are. He was showing me what they're doing.
*  He's like, there's nothing like this.
*  There's no other animal like this.
*  And during the course of his show,
*  he developed this profound respect and appreciation for octopus.
*  They're amazing.
*  I was on a scuba diving just a few weeks ago in the U.S.
*  Virgin Islands on a night dive and actually saw an octopus get a crab.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Plunged on the crab and it just sort of.
*  Just sort of.
*  Did you ever see that video that they had to do a
*  they put a camera in a tank at the aquarium because they were losing sharks
*  and they're trying to figure out what the hell is going on.
*  So they put a camera in there to watch.
*  It turns out the octopus were killing the sharks.
*  How big was the octopus?
*  Not big with the sharks.
*  Well, the octopus is basically the same size as the sharks.
*  Not I mean, it wasn't a big shark, a small shark.
*  But, you know, they never thought an octopus would hunt a shark.
*  And the octopus was just sitting there chilling all camouflaged and shark.
*  Sharks are kind of dopey.
*  You know, sharks are not intelligent.
*  They just turn around. They're just cleaners.
*  They're just they're the cleanup crew.
*  They eat a lot of things and kill a lot of things.
*  And but they're mostly cleanups.
*  Yeah. And this this watch this watch you swimming by.
*  And the octopus is like, bitch, come here.
*  Just wraps them up.
*  But the octopus looked exactly like the coral.
*  Back it up again, Jamie, so we can see what it looked like.
*  Go from the beginning.
*  OK, but the crazy thing is like you
*  literally look how it changes color right before it's almost like he sees red.
*  And so it jacked this shark and slowly
*  pulled it into its body and then just ate it up for whatever it's worth.
*  If you watch my octopus teacher, which is you really got this unbelievable
*  film work, the camera work is incredible.
*  This guy follows this octopus around for a full year and out the coast of South
*  Africa, and he's a free diver, no tanks, you know,
*  he holds his breath for several minutes and the big enemy of the octopus there
*  were sharks, these pajama sharks, they were called, and they would hunt
*  for the octopus and the octopus would have to get away.
*  Pajama sharks. Here it is.
*  Yeah, here it is. My octopus teacher.
*  Pajama sharks.
*  I've never heard of a pajama shark.
*  So this octopus is hanging out with his dog.
*  Oh, yeah, they got to be buddies.
*  That's so wild.
*  There's a shark.
*  Oh, wow. Oh, no.
*  He sees his buddy get jacked.
*  Yeah.
*  That's kind of rough.
*  He didn't die from that, though.
*  What? The octopus
*  released one of his arms.
*  He lost an arm and he grew it back.
*  Do you know that female octopuses are much larger than the males, as much as like
*  25 percent larger than the males?
*  And they I didn't know that sometimes have sex with the males.
*  And sometimes they pretend they're sort of like sort of like kill them and eat them.
*  They they cannibalize the males.
*  They'll hold on to them and eat them for days.
*  Sort of like the spiders do.
*  Black widow spiders.
*  Yeah, but different because the black widows do it every single time.
*  There's one.
*  They observe this one octopus.
*  He got real greedy.
*  He made it with this female 13 times.
*  Thirteen.
*  That's how annoyed she must have been.
*  Well, she waited till the 14th time and she's like, not today, bitch.
*  And she grabbed him and and ate him and killed him.
*  But because the females far larger
*  physically, the male has to be like real skittish about it.
*  Like, hey, what do you think?
*  How you feel today? Hungry?
*  There needs to be a revolution in the in the social structure of octopus.
*  What are you laughing at?
*  To make it more to make it more equal.
*  There's an article about this.
*  And the first thing it says, like they have tricks they do.
*  The first thing that they do is they
*  disguise themselves as another gal, it says, and sneak into a female den.
*  Well, that's what cuttlefish do.
*  That's the cuttlefish move.
*  Oh, I love cuttlefish.
*  Yeah. Male octopus.
*  Hold on. Sorry.
*  I have a big problem.
*  Female octopus is each male wants to mate and pass on his genes.
*  The new generation trouble is the female is often larger and hungrier than he is.
*  So there's a constant risk that instead of mating, the female will strangle him and eat him.
*  The males have a host of tricks to survive, though.
*  Yeah. Good luck.
*  Some of them quite literally made it arms length.
*  Well, you know why they actually release their arms.
*  Each arm that an octopus has is actually a penis.
*  So they got eight.
*  Yeah, they have sex with their arm.
*  So when we have a lot, we could.
*  There's a lot we could learn.
*  There's a lot we could learn from octopus.
*  Yes. I don't know how they masturbate, though.
*  They could probably have a real problem.
*  Like rubbing penises together is not very productive.
*  But I think each arm is a penis.
*  But for whatever, either way, their arm is most certainly a penis.
*  And when the woman, the female octopus is attacking, they will release their arm.
*  They literally will give her the arm.
*  They let her snap the arm off and then she eats the arm.
*  Better to keep the other seven arms.
*  Well, I guess, yeah, that's imagine.
*  I mean, there's a divorce metaphor in there somewhere.
*  And sex is dangerous.
*  What can you say? Well, it's also weird.
*  They regenerate their arms, which is pretty, pretty crafty.
*  Yeah. You know, that's what you know, when they catch stone crabs,
*  they catch them and they just snap off their claw and then throw them back and
*  then just grow a claw. Oh, you mean humans?
*  People catch. Yeah, exactly.
*  It's one of the weirder fish or weirder
*  kind of types of seafood because it's one of the rare ones where you can catch the
*  thing, snap off one of their limbs and chuck them back.
*  You keep part of them and they still survive.
*  And they don't even probably.
*  I suspect they survive less long with only one claw than if they had a couple of claws.
*  Yeah, I would imagine.
*  But they have a chance to survive.
*  Yeah, they have a better chance than if they just get immediately eaten.
*  That just to correct that eight eight arm penis thing, the only one says that they
*  have their main tool is their specialized mating arm.
*  It works like the other arms, but it has
*  some special ability to bend, stretch and exert suction.
*  So they have one arm that's a special penis arm.
*  Mm hmm.
*  It has some extra bells and whistles, as this says.
*  Do they grow that one back if she steals it?
*  Imagine that's the one you don't want to offer up.
*  Maybe, maybe you're tired of it.
*  It's got a special tip, obviously.
*  Maybe they're tired of like worried about getting eaten like, oh, great.
*  She took my penis. Good.
*  I can relax for a couple of weeks while it grows back.
*  Stay away from these vicious broads and their goddamn cannibalistic instincts.
*  So he only has one of those.
*  Yeah. And it goes there's a quick there's a picture.
*  I haven't seen a picture.
*  Find out if that one grows back.
*  There's the picture of what it looks like.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  It has to go all the way.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It goes into her brain.
*  Oh, my God.
*  No wonder why she wants to kill him.
*  Probably annoying. Right.
*  Her ovaries are in the back of her head.
*  That's nuts.
*  So the testes. Wow.
*  So he's got a.
*  So his testicles are the back of his brain and her.
*  What a strange animal, man.
*  They are. You said they're aliens.
*  Yeah, they really are.
*  I mean, if we found them on some far off planet, we would not be stunned.
*  Like if they didn't exist here and we found them somewhere else,
*  we'd be like, oh, alien life.
*  We're just so accustomed to some of the more bizarre things.
*  Squid are also bizarre.
*  Oh, yeah. And and and so are cuttlefish.
*  Yes, cuttlefish.
*  We were talking about cuttlefish before that.
*  Eric Weinstein is one who told me about the cuttlefish strategy,
*  that male cuttlefish will pretend to be female and they'll do that in order
*  to trick the females into being friends with them.
*  And then they get some.
*  Like male feminists, basically the same thing.
*  I'm not going to go there.
*  This is that they have the
*  the whole old school arm reach around like that guy's
*  movie theater, but they don't even go inside the den.
*  That's for them to safely mate,
*  reach in, slide it in, and then just like they're not even in the same room.
*  Technically, wow.
*  That is reaching and just get into her brain.
*  What a bizarre method of mating.
*  You know, linking brains, females have different tastes.
*  Yeah, some of them, too.
*  Don't be sexist. Listen to this guy.
*  Yeah, that's a weird animal to eat,
*  octopus, because they're smarter than dogs.
*  They're really smart.
*  Do you is intelligence one of the variables you use?
*  Determining what animals you'll eat and not eat?
*  Yes and no, because pigs are intelligent,
*  but I'll eat wild pigs because pigs are invasive.
*  And it's a real problem in terms of like management of wildlife
*  and the amount of animals that you have and what kind of destruction they can do
*  to ground nesting birds and other species that are native to the area.
*  Invasive animals are a gigantic issue.
*  And pigs in particular are one of the most
*  devastating invasive species that we have in North America for sure,
*  but worldwide in Australia, they're a giant problem.
*  There are actually now increasing problem in the hill country here.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No, I have a friend that lives half hour out of town and he's got them,
*  which is that's not very far.
*  We wipe out their natural predators.
*  No, there are no natural predators.
*  I've never had any here.
*  They were brought in here from Russia and from other countries.
*  They they're a very durable animal that breeds constantly.
*  And their natural predators are, you know, for if you're going to keep a population
*  of pigs down, you've got to have some fucking monsters out there.
*  Like if you want to have their natural
*  predators, their natural predators are not just going to stop at pigs.
*  They're going to eat all sorts of other
*  animals and domestic animals and livestock and like, yeah, they're invasive.
*  Big cats or or wolves would probably be natural predators for these pigs.
*  But you need so many of them.
*  They're so prolific.
*  They breed so often.
*  They breed three or four times a year.
*  And Joe, you've got to get out there and help protect our land.
*  No, I'm not the guy, but I will eat them and I will kill them.
*  But the pigs, the wild pigs in the when when they're six months old, they're viable.
*  So they start having sex and breeding at six months old.
*  And they'll they'll breed a litter three times a year sometimes, which is crazy.
*  So they'll have four or five piglets three times a year.
*  So one pig could be responsible for as many as 20 other pigs, one female in a year.
*  And I have a friend who works on a ranch and he says you have never seen anything
*  like the devastation these things do when they move in and find a crop.
*  So if they'll have a crop of food that these folks need for their livelihood
*  and then a pack of wild pigs come in and just destroys it.
*  Wow. Says it's pretty wild to see.
*  And some of them are huge.
*  We own we own a place
*  40 miles west of Austin, and we see a lot of the pig
*  pig scat, plus where they dig.
*  So we don't actually see them because they're nocturnal.
*  Yeah, they hunt them at night.
*  Yeah, which is really crazy.
*  Friends that do them with night vision goggles and night vision scopes and,
*  you know, and there's people that hunt them with helicopters as well,
*  which is very unique to Texas.
*  They have these helicopter hunts and they they they say that this other than
*  capturing them in traps like this, one of the most effective ways to do it.
*  Well,
*  you've got me, I'm a grocer who sells meat, but I'm a plant based guy who doesn't
*  eat it, so you've got me in a paradox there.
*  Well, that is that weird for you?
*  Do you have an issue, an ethical issue with selling the meat or do you make sure
*  that the farmers or the ranchers that do sell you guys the meat hold up very
*  strict ethics? We try to do the latter, although I'll tell you a story.
*  The very first store I opened up before
*  Whole Foods was called Safer Way and this vegetarian store.
*  And it was not only vegetarian, it was very pure.
*  We didn't really sell sugar or refined sugars or white flour.
*  Even didn't even sell coffee.
*  And we also did very little business.
*  We were not we were we were so narrow in the marketplace.
*  We weren't successful.
*  And it wasn't until we we relocated that store, merged with another store,
*  changed the name to Whole Foods Market and opened a bigger store that sold
*  meat, coffee, alcohol, you know, all natural and organic foods.
*  But a full spectrum that that we became successful.
*  So was that in many ways like a battle for you a little bit because you have this
*  one idealistic perspective of what a supermarket could be versus this?
*  It wasn't it was a battle.
*  I put it this way.
*  It's like what I learned is that in order to do the most good in the world,
*  in order to help the most people, you have to be willing to meet the
*  marketplace where you find it.
*  If you stand or try to stand above the
*  marketplace and you're too pure for the marketplace, then you're not going to help
*  anybody. You're going to fail. You're going to go out of business.
*  Ultimately, customers vote.
*  They decide whether you prosper or fail.
*  And SaferWave was going to fail because we would it be possible to do it today?
*  Maybe so today.
*  The world's different today than it was in 1978.
*  But back then we were going to fail.
*  We lost half our money in the first year.
*  And 1978, Starbucks wasn't around, was it?
*  No, no, no.
*  Actually, Starbucks was
*  they I don't think they were around.
*  They were getting close to being around.
*  Nobody knew how addictive coffee was back then.
*  Oh, yeah, they did.
*  But they didn't really.
*  They did. But they were drinking instant coffee like Folgers and Maxwell House.
*  Or Dunkin Donuts.
*  That's where I used to drink.
*  But I never thought that coffee would be a thing that would be on every corner.
*  Like there's a place in Houston and Louis Black used to have a joke about it where
*  you'd be on it was in River Oaks.
*  It was across the street from another Starbucks.
*  There was a Starbucks across the street from another Starbucks.
*  It was the strangest thing.
*  It's like, well, New York City, they got on practically in Manhattan on every block.
*  Yeah. But this was across the street.
*  Well, there was a cartoon once that said,
*  I just opened up a Starbucks in the bathroom in the bathroom of Starbucks.
*  But people are so addicted to it.
*  It's so strange how addicted they are to getting their Starbucks fix.
*  They use their apps and so when you were selling no coffee back then,
*  were you doing it because you don't believe in coffee?
*  You think coffee is bad for you?
*  Or did you make a decision?
*  Is it a fair trade issue?
*  No, it was we just
*  didn't think it was a healthy food.
*  So we didn't sell it.
*  And then now we do sell it.
*  We sell probably I'm sure we sell probably
*  one of the largest coffee distributors in the United States now, probably.
*  Yeah, you probably are.
*  I think out of.
*  I think they've done studies on moderate coffee consumption.
*  They've shown it to not have a detrimental effect.
*  There's no nutritive value in coffee, except for perhaps some antioxidants.
*  But the studies do indicate that
*  moderate consumption of coffee is consistent with longevity.
*  Yeah.
*  So I don't think it's a it's not a
*  it's not like smoking cigarettes.
*  It's not there's a cognitive benefit to it, too, that some people think
*  it's worth the squeeze mental stimulant.
*  Yeah.
*  Problem is, I have to admit that I'm a decaf guy.
*  I got off a coffee, but it tastes like shit.
*  Why not just drink? I'm going to sneeze.
*  It's so dangerous today.
*  Thank God I've been tested.
*  Absolutely. Unless you got infected and it hasn't shown up yet.
*  I didn't.
*  But tea tastes better.
*  Why don't you drink tea? Why would you want decaf coffee?
*  I I like decaf espresso.
*  It tastes really good.
*  You have to like regular espresso.
*  I want to I want to feel the juice getting in the veins.
*  Well, the darkness.
*  I've taken that.
*  I was recovering.
*  It took me when I got off a caffeine back in the year 2000.
*  I had first of all, I had physical withdrawal symptoms of headaches.
*  It lasted horrible headaches.
*  It lasted about a week before the headaches went away.
*  And then I was exhausted.
*  I was tired.
*  And all I could think about if I would have a cup of coffee or some tea right now,
*  I'd feel good again. I'd have energy back.
*  Yeah. Exactly.
*  She's done it.
*  However, however, after 30 days, after 30 days,
*  I got in the caffeine out of my system,
*  takes caffeine about seven days to completely leave your system.
*  And my my adrenals began to be reestablished.
*  I kind of got my own energy back.
*  You know, that's bullshit.
*  What? Adrenals.
*  That that what you just said is bullshit, that you're taxing your adrenals.
*  That's some voodoo nonsense that those holistic people like to tell you.
*  That's true. Yeah.
*  Now, I've read it.
*  There was a study on it recently where they were talking about, like,
*  what it would actually take to tax your adrenals.
*  And then what people are talking about is a withdrawal from caffeine, which is real.
*  Let me let me let me withdraw that statement because I wasn't the point of it.
*  The point of it was that once I got my own vitality back,
*  it was I was no longer at the serve.
*  I've no longer servant of the caffeine,
*  which would determine when I felt good and when I didn't feel good.
*  I just had my natural flow of energy and vitality.
*  And having compared the two states, this is a preferable state in my mind.
*  I feel a lot better. I believe that 100 percent.
*  The problem I was having is that the adrenal thing is the thing that people say
*  that a lot of people say I'm not I'm not a
*  that's what I've read.
*  So but I don't know it for any certainty.
*  So I've read it.
*  What I do know is I felt a lot better when I got off a bomb.
*  Sure. When I got off a caffeine, you have a mean it's a stimulant.
*  And that's what caffeine is.
*  And you got to pay that you create a debt.
*  You got to pay that stimulus back.
*  Yeah. But I was I recently read this article by nutritionists was explaining
*  like what would have to be what would have to go wrong in your system for you
*  to tax your adrenals.
*  That's just not how it works.
*  And you're just dealing with a stimulant and that your body is getting off
*  of that stimulant and like any other stimulant, there's going to be a withdrawal.
*  Right. But it's not that you're taxing your adrenals.
*  OK, you know, but see, people say things like that, like you're polluting your
*  kidneys or damaging your kidneys by eating too much protein.
*  You know, what can I say?
*  I've read possibly different studies and articles and you have it in different books.
*  Well, I had too many people explain things to me here where, you know,
*  I had some ideas that I had in my head that I thought was correct in terms
*  of nutrition and what's good and what's bad for you.
*  And you let me give you a couple of facts that you might find interesting.
*  First of all, there's been only one diet
*  that's been proven to reverse heart disease, and that is a whole foods plant based diet.
*  I don't think that's true.
*  I know what you're saying, but I've actually read that that's not true either,
*  that this proven to reduce heart disease,
*  that that's not what's reducing heart disease, what's reducing heart disease is
*  healthy behaviors and that you're making this change in terms of eliminating toxic
*  foods and processed foods.
*  And so do you have any other studies that show you can reverse heart disease
*  without being on a whole foods plant based diet?
*  Reverse it, reverse it.
*  See, that's the thing.
*  It's like nutritionists have explained to me that there's a giant flaw in these
*  epidemiology.
*  This is not epidemiology.
*  This is not epidemiology.
*  This is how would you do that?
*  These are controlled studies.
*  Dean Ornish and Caldwell Dessalaston.
*  They're the two giants.
*  Reversing heart disease just because of a plant based diet.
*  No, not just plant based diet.
*  A whole foods plant based low fat diet has been proven to reverse it.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  It is true.
*  OK, we're going to find out if it is.
*  When Jamie will pull something up,
*  because I've read something about how that was bullshit, too.
*  And it was by in my book, by the way.
*  So my studies are in the book.
*  The whole foods. Oh, I'm sure you've read some things that say that.
*  Let me give you the other facts.
*  OK, so do you know about the Blue Zones?
*  Yes, I do.
*  OK, well, five Blue Zones, their diets are remarkably similar.
*  They're basically eating about on average, according to Dan Buechner.
*  Good guy to have on your show sometime.
*  Like you are Belinda, right?
*  You're Belinda, California.
*  Loma Linda Loma Linda, Loma Linda, the seven day.
*  I'm thinking you're Belinda.
*  Yeah, I think you are.
*  We're talking about caffeine.
*  You got that maybe your choice.
*  You're not.
*  But you know, that one's that's a Seventh Day Adventist.
*  But there's also the the Okinawa, Icaria, Greece.
*  Right.
*  You understand healthy user bias, right?
*  This is like the great example of the Seventh Day Adventist.
*  They don't drink any alcohol.
*  They exercise every day.
*  There's they have many more positive habits and you apply those positive habits.
*  And the fact that you eat a vegetarian diet, you could assume that the reason
*  why they're healthy is because of the vegetarian diet.
*  That's not what I'm saying, because none of the Blue Zones,
*  except for a small subset of the Seventh Day Adventists, are actually vegetarian.
*  Most of them just eat small quantities of animal foods, about 10 percent of their
*  calories, which is what we recommend in this book.
*  Right. But they're almost all very active people.
*  But we don't have any examples of longevity in any culture that eats a heavy meat diet.
*  None longevity.
*  Longevity.
*  Living the Messiah.
*  The average you know, the average age of a Messiah.
*  No, I don't. Forty five.
*  Well, don't they fuck up lions with spears?
*  Whatever.
*  That's not a risky business.
*  It may be, but it's not a good example.
*  Yeah.
*  How about the but I was just saying, innuence?
*  That's another one that's used.
*  They're usually they they have the highest heart disease.
*  OK, stop right there, because that's not normal.
*  This is a recent occurrence with them because of cigarettes and alcohol,
*  Western diet and changing the way they live.
*  Like the introduction of cigarettes and alcohol is what's fucked those people up.
*  I'm merely saying, and I put the challenge to you,
*  show me examples of long lived peoples that are heavy consumers of animal foods.
*  I don't know of any specific long term
*  studies that have been done on people who are eating a lot of animal food and are
*  also very active and and healthy and making healthy choices outside of that.
*  The problem with alcohol and cigarettes and all these other things that people
*  tend to eat tend to take in and consume when they're also consuming animal foods
*  is that all those things get lumped in together.
*  I agree.
*  And the Blue Zones doesn't claim that it's just diet.
*  They actually believe there's many factors.
*  There's the amount of movement that people do,
*  the healthy community that they have, some type of purpose, higher purpose,
*  spirituality or just Google plant based diet has not been shown to reverse heart
*  disease because this article that I was reading, I wish I had saved it.
*  Mind you, I want to keep saying it's not just a plant based.
*  Plant based diet can be remarkably unhealthy if you're eating a junk,
*  if you're eating the vegan cheeses all the time.
*  You're saying whole food, whole food, plant based diet and fairly
*  lots of fruits and vegetables, beans, whole grains, small quantities of nuts and seeds.
*  That's an extremely healthy diet.
*  And if you add a little bit of animal
*  foods to it, then it's still going to be a really healthy diet.
*  That's what the Blue Zones do.
*  I think we can all agree on is that eating toxic food, eating processed food, not
*  healthy, not exercising, living a sedentary lifestyle, consumption of cigarettes and
*  alcohol, all these things are detrimental to your health.
*  Absolutely.
*  I'll even go so far as to say that.
*  A vegan junk food diet is about the most
*  unhealthy diet you can eat because you're just eating processed foods.
*  Yeah, animal foods are actually whole foods, right?
*  And they have a variety of nutrients in them.
*  You can get them all from plants except for B12.
*  So what do you think is bad about animal foods other than the ethics?
*  From a health standpoint, the it depends on how much you eat.
*  And if you eat too much of it, then we see the heart disease, we see cancer.
*  These all correlate very closely with the right.
*  But now you're talking about epidemiology studies.
*  Yes, but epidemiology, we can't do controlled studies on people over the long term.
*  Right. But you understand that the people that you're seeing,
*  high rates of cancer and heart disease aren't consuming grass fed steak and salads.
*  What they're consuming is cheeseburgers,
*  fries and milkshakes and soda and all sorts of bullshit.
*  So when they do a study on someone,
*  they say, how often do you eat meat?
*  And they say, I eat meat five days a week.
*  And they go, oh, well, look at the incidence of cancer and people that fill
*  out the study and say they eat meat five days a week.
*  That's where I understand these correlations and connections.
*  It's like it's like I do this debate all the time, too.
*  And so I I understand your position on this.
*  And all I would say is
*  find the other epidemiology, where the epidemiological studies
*  to support your point of view, there aren't any.
*  Well, epidemiology studies, it's a point my point of view.
*  What do you mean?
*  If you want an epidemiology study that supported the fact that animal foods are
*  not bad for you, you would have to find groups of people that only eat animal
*  foods and don't consume alcohol and cigarettes and then compare them to people
*  that do and find out what the variables are.
*  Right.
*  I think people who do consume cigarettes and do consume alcohol and do consume
*  processed foods and sugars and excess corn syrup foods and all the shit that we
*  know as a part of a standard American diet.
*  Right.
*  Are you saying that people that consume animal foods are more likely to consume
*  processed food, cigarettes and alcohol?
*  They are because people have been told that animal foods are bad for you.
*  So when people like fuck it and they just have a cheeseburger,
*  particularly if you're talking about the average American, the average American,
*  they're getting their meat.
*  They're probably not eating a grass fed rib eye.
*  They're probably eating a cheeseburger
*  that they get from Jack in the Box or someplace like that.
*  So you're getting processed foods.
*  You're getting meat, but you're also getting sugar and corn syrup and all sorts
*  of other nonsense.
*  That's the problem with these epidemiology studies.
*  And you know that.
*  Yeah. But you're you're talking about a pretty small group.
*  If you've got the whole world to work from, there are lots of the world eats
*  animal foods that are grass fed and the same type of results show up there.
*  Generally, the more same type of results in terms of what the term heart disease
*  and cancer and with people that occasionally.
*  Like, what are the what are the studies you're talking about?
*  I can usually like me to send you some studies.
*  No, I want you to tell me right now because you're saying it like you know it
*  for a fact, like what studies are showing that people that consume grass fed meat
*  and vegetables are showing the same levels of heart disease and cancer as people
*  that eat the standard American diet.
*  Since I don't have those studies in front of me, they don't they only exist.
*  Parsing out the standard American diet.
*  I can I can I can send it to you.
*  It's toxic.
*  But eating horse shit and drinking soda, it's not good for your body.
*  It's terrible. Right.
*  Well, that's where we agree.
*  We agree processed foods are bad.
*  So when you're getting this standard American diet and applying it to an
*  epidemiology study where they're saying, oh, this person eats meat five days a week.
*  Well, what else do they eat?
*  The problem with those studies is they're so flawed.
*  If you're making someone fill out a form,
*  you're having an argument with somebody besides me,
*  somebody you've had an argument with in the past because I'm not saying that you're
*  you're overreacting to things that I'm saying based on some other discussions
*  you've had in the past.
*  I don't think I'm overreacting.
*  If you're interested, I will send you studies
*  and I can I can tell you that the studies
*  contradict what you're saying and that the epidemiology cannot be
*  because it's not as good as a randomized controlled study,
*  which are hard to do in nutrition, does not make them worthless.
*  It just means that they're not a complete answer, but they they do point in certain
*  directions, but they're conveniently pointing to this meat argument versus all
*  the other stuff they're eating, which we've shown to be bad for you.
*  People have been eating meat since the beginning of time, but not in very large
*  quantities generally depends on what people.
*  Yeah, it depends on which people.
*  I mean, people that have been around
*  Buffalo and that's all they could eat, they ate nothing but Buffalo.
*  So the animals that we are closest to from an evolutionary standpoint are the
*  chimpanzees, the bonobos and the gorillas.
*  We're not exactly the same, but they're
*  the closest relatives we have in nature.
*  The gorillas are 100 percent.
*  And by the way, they're pretty damn big.
*  They get enough protein.
*  Gorillas have a completely different digestive system.
*  Not completely different.
*  It's very different.
*  They eat only leaves and grass and bark and shit.
*  It's very different.
*  The chimpanzees are about 95 percent plant based.
*  And they're the closest to us.
*  They're about 99 percent.
*  So excited when they kill monkeys.
*  Have you ever watched those videos like the David Attenborough videos?
*  They eat about they eat about five percent of their calories.
*  Studies show they eat about five percent of their calories, animal foods.
*  And again, I'm not arguing that we don't eat any humans.
*  We clearly evolved as omnivores.
*  But in general, we were mostly gatherers who we couldn't preserve most animal foods.
*  We didn't have the technology to preserve it.
*  So we feasted when we could get it.
*  But you could smoke some of it and dry some of it for jerky.
*  But in general, we didn't have massive supplies of animal foods.
*  We were mostly eating plants with a little bit of animal foods.
*  That might be the optimum human right.
*  But you also understand that most plants are inedible.
*  Most plants are inedible, too.
*  Yeah. And most animals are edible.
*  That's probably true.
*  So well, so whenever they do think got a chance to eat plants, there's a lot.
*  Probably a real careful with what they could eat and what they couldn't eat
*  because most of it was inedible and not much of it even toxic.
*  Most of it, they can catch an animal and eat it.
*  They're almost all edible.
*  How many different animal foods do you eat?
*  How many different ones?
*  Give me a rough estimate.
*  Eggs, meat, fish.
*  No, but maybe 20 different kinds, probably something like that.
*  How many different plant foods do you eat?
*  Well, I live in a Western society where I can go to Whole Foods and I can get
*  tomatoes and all kinds of avocados, stuff that's not even grown here.
*  I mean, when we were when we were for a different world, when we were foraging,
*  we knew what were toxic plants because we'd had our grandparents died.
*  Exactly. Yeah.
*  And so but there was a huge variety of plants.
*  We ate massively diverse diets when we were out foraging, right?
*  Probably far more diverse than we eat today, even though there's a whole foods
*  market, just because there were so many different foods out there in the wild
*  and in the woods and the jungles.
*  This will have to be a conversation that we can have at another time, probably.
*  But what's your point?
*  I agree with you that there's probably a lot of different plants.
*  I was talking about, well, you were saying that that
*  we can eat any kind of animal, but we can't eat any kind of plant.
*  And I'm saying there's so much more
*  abundance of plants to choose from than in our normal diet or in our
*  when we were foragers than animals.
*  Animals were for sure a much smaller percentage of our total calorie consumption,
*  probably because they're really hard to catch.
*  But they also think that one of the reasons why we became human beings was
*  because of hunting and that's directly correlated to an increase of brain size.
*  Cooking meat and hunting and having more access to proteins.
*  You understand that's a theory.
*  That's not science.
*  That's just a theory. Right.
*  It's one of the most probable theories,
*  one of the most accepted theories in terms of the increase in human brain size.
*  There's an equally
*  theory that that probably when we became
*  root eaters is when we were they got brain.
*  I've never read that theater, that theory rather when we became root eaters.
*  That's when our brains grew.
*  We started eating tubers.
*  How come rabbits aren't gigantic brains?
*  They are not big tubers eaters.
*  They're leaf eaters.
*  Rabbits eat carrots, man.
*  You watch Bugs Bunny.
*  So how do those blue whales get so damn big just eating krill plankton?
*  Well, they eat a lot of things.
*  They don't just eat plankton.
*  I think the blue whales are plankton eaters.
*  That's it. That's all they eat.
*  I think there are other whales that are definitely eating.
*  Yeah. Listen, we're not whales.
*  Right.
*  This is going to be a weird conversation.
*  The whales have still never figured out how to grow fingers.
*  We're humans.
*  We're great apes.
*  And we've evolved similar to what I don't like.
*  Those. How come this animal can do it?
*  We're not that animal.
*  We know from the blue zones that the people that eat mostly plant based diets live the longest.
*  There's such massive amount of evidence if you open your mind to it.
*  Well, listen, my mind's open.
*  Those blue zones are also people that are very active.
*  There's a direct correlation between physical activity.
*  I think that people that live a vegan diet, that follow a vegan diet, but are healthy
*  and exercise are far better off than someone who lives a sedentary lifestyle and even
*  even eats healthy meat.
*  I think the key is healthy.
*  Like if you're going to be a healthy person, you need physical activity and that there's
*  a direct correlation between physical activity and longevity and health benefits.
*  Of course. Absolutely.
*  Right. Well, this is what you see a lot in these blue zones as well.
*  Right. Yes.
*  I mean, I'm merely saying what's true.
*  There's one factor.
*  Diet is a factor.
*  It's not it may be one of the most important factors, but it's not the only factor for
*  longevity. But the longest lived peoples, what they have in common is they all move.
*  They all have families and communities.
*  They and they also mostly plant based on whole foods, plant based diets.
*  That's mostly what they eat with some animal foods.
*  I'm not none of them are vegan except for a small subset of the Adventists.
*  But they are mostly plant based eaters that have a small 10 percent of their
*  calories in animal foods. At least that's what the studies show.
*  These studies also show that they're also very active.
*  Yes, they are very active.
*  Yeah, I just not because they're out running around, but just because they're
*  moving, doing things.
*  You find anything?
*  I mean, there's a lot of stuff on this topic.
*  I wish I had my own research.
*  I need to have my own research that I read recently.
*  I think the article was basically stop saying that a vegan diet reverses heart
*  disease and it was explaining all the problems in that logic.
*  I didn't find that specific one, but there's an article here from the British
*  Heart Foundation that talks about this.
*  And I think that started with a small study of 22 people that did plant based.
*  And four of them had some reversal.
*  This article here, though, currently goes into deeper studies and.
*  Says that there isn't really a good study about it.
*  It's not what I can find.
*  So this is a study published in 2014,
*  looked at one hundred ninety eight patients to further investigate whether
*  eating a strict plant based diet could stop or reverse heart disease.
*  It found that of the hundred seventy seven patients who stuck to the diet,
*  the majority reported a reduction in symptoms and 22 percent had a disease
*  reversal confirmed by test results, but that study didn't just rule out animal
*  products and also cut out added oils, processed foods, sugar, refined carbohydrates,
*  excess salt, fruit juice, avocados and nuts.
*  Physical activity was also encouraged and prescribed.
*  Medication continued.
*  This is the problem with saying that.
*  And this this is not just there's not just one of these that's like this.
*  It's basically the same thing.
*  You're talking about people that make healthy choices.
*  And that's what's reverse heart disease also change their diet and eat healthier.
*  But not just a plant.
*  I mean, not just eight plants and a plant based diet, but also
*  remove processed foods and sugars, of course, a whole foods plant based low fat
*  diet. That's the three that's proven to reverse heart disease.
*  Yeah, but all these people also cut out sugar, refined carbohydrates, excess salt,
*  fruit juice, those are not whole foods.
*  Exactly. But they cut out the bullshit that was killing them.
*  It wasn't that plant based diets were
*  reversing heart disease, they cut out the things that were killing them.
*  This is what the other article that I wish I could find it.
*  So I guess what I'm saying is show me a study that people eat,
*  cut out all the processed foods, eat a high percentage of their calories
*  in animal foods, say 30, 40 percent of their calories from animal foods and
*  reverse heart disease.
*  There hasn't been any studies showing that the people are cutting out toxic
*  things that we know are toxic. I don't believe animal foods are toxic.
*  I think people have been eating animal foods from the beginning of time.
*  I think the problem is these things that we haven't been eating since the beginning
*  of time, processed carbohydrates, sugars, fruit juice, all the bullshit,
*  vegetable oils, all these things that people have been adding to their diets
*  fairly recently that coincides with a direct uptick in heart disease.
*  So your hypothesis is, first of all, I don't have a hypothesis.
*  This is just shit that I've read.
*  OK, so what you believe from the shit you've read is that you could eat a high
*  animal food diet, cut out all the processed stuff and you'd reverse heart disease.
*  I think that if I have heart disease,
*  I have heart disease is because they eat shit and they don't exercise.
*  I think that is where heart disease is coming from.
*  I don't think plants are going to fix your heart.
*  I think it comes from both.
*  And you think it just comes from the processed foods.
*  That's where we part company.
*  Yeah, that is probably where we part company.
*  I think plants are good for you.
*  Don't get me wrong.
*  So I think eating healthy and eating whole foods, we both agree, are good for you.
*  I just don't think that is bad for you.
*  I don't think in small quantities meat is bad for you, but I think in large
*  quantities it starts to clog up your arteries and your propensity to cancer
*  goes up because I think that's what the science shows.
*  I don't think the science does show that.
*  I don't think that science shows that large
*  send you the studies clogs your heart, clogs your arteries.
*  Is that what happens?
*  The high fat content of the meat over time clogs up your arteries.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I'd like to sit you down with a doctor who disagrees with you and have you go
*  back and forth with it because it's a complicated issue.
*  Diet is a very complicated issue and it goes along with so many different things
*  that people choose lifestyle choices.
*  When you see the results like how healthy or how sick you are, there's a lot of
*  factors that go into there, but people that are plant based tend to lean on that
*  one factor.
*  They tend to lean on this one aspect of their lifestyle choices that seems to be
*  improving health.
*  And I don't think,
*  I don't think you could do that as much as I don't think that you can lean on
*  meat as being a cause of cancer.
*  When you look at epidemiology studies with people that eat meat five days a week,
*  but also consume a bunch of bullshit.
*  So clearly we're going to not agree on this one.
*  I think we need to make studies that show,
*  like if they had a study where they took someone or took a group of people,
*  a large group like in that study and they took them off of the standard American
*  diet and fed them grass fed beef and vegetables and then had them exercise on a
*  regular basis. I bet we would see similar results.
*  First of all, if you did pen again, it's a matter of degree.
*  If you're feeding people vegetables,
*  fruits and vegetables and they're not in your take out all the shit,
*  that's a pretty healthy diet right there.
*  It's just not the healthiest diet I think you could eat,
*  but it's a lot healthier than the standard American diet.
*  So you're going to get some good results on it.
*  I'm merely saying and that the studies that we know that have actually reversed
*  heart disease,
*  cut out all the shit and also limit oil or don't have any oil limit total fat
*  consumption and also limit animal foods. That's worked.
*  Now maybe others will work as well. As you say,
*  we should do a study where they eat 30% of their calories in animal foods,
*  cut out all the processed carbohydrates and see if that reverses heart disease.
*  I agree. Let's do the study. But as far as I know, no study has been done.
*  So that for now, based on what we know now,
*  we do know that if you eat a whole foods plant based low fat diet,
*  you can reverse your heart disease because it's been proven repeatedly.
*  We do know that if you cut out all the shit that we know gives you heart disease,
*  it will reverse heart disease.
*  And if you eat whole foods along with that and exercise, you'll be healthier.
*  What we don't know is that meat gives you cancer.
*  We don't know is that meat gives you heart disease and that meat hurts you.
*  First of all, I've never said that meat gives you cancer.
*  But you said that plant based diet has been shown to reverse heart disease.
*  I don't think that's what we can say. I think what we can say is that cutting
*  out all the things that we know are very unhealthy exercising and eating plants
*  are probably good for it because they're whole foods.
*  You can say that we,
*  we aren't certain that the meat is a contributing factor,
*  but we cannot say that the studies that have reversed it didn't include meat.
*  Now maybe meat was neutral. Maybe it had nothing to do with it.
*  So you might be right. I'm not saying you're wrong,
*  but I'm saying that you don't have any studies on your side and reversing heart
*  disease. And meat has been cut out along with the crap and heart disease gets
*  reversed. Maybe meat had nothing to do with it. Maybe if they,
*  if they kept the meat in, they still would have reversed heart disease.
*  But no studies have shown that. That's all I'm saying.
*  But this study is all changing lifestyle.
*  It's not just a plant based diet.
*  I'm not saying it is. I mean it's well, actually the problem is,
*  Esselstyn studies, they only change diet. Ornish changed.
*  He had people moving and meditating. Esselstyn,
*  if you read prevent and reverse heart disease by Caldwell,
*  they also stand in his studies. All he did was control for diet. And that,
*  and it, and, well,
*  it's amazing statistic amount of people that reverse their heart disease. So,
*  we'll have to, we'll have to have a further conversation. I'm going to send you,
*  I'll send you some data.
*  I think the idea that meat is not bad for you is a fairly recent idea.
*  I think that people have been, first of all,
*  you have to go back to the sugar industry,
*  bribing scientists to say that saturated fat and not sugar is what caused heart
*  disease. And I'm sure you're aware of that.
*  I've had a debate with Nina Ty Schultz and I've argued with Gary Tobs before.
*  So I see it differently than they do.
*  You see what differently? The fact that the sugar industry bribed scientists?
*  That sugar.
*  You know about that though, right?
*  You have to read through my book.
*  Okay. But before I do that,
*  you know that the sugar industry has been proven to have bribed scientists to
*  alter results so that they prove that they were,
*  they're pointing to the idea that it was saturated fat that was causing heart
*  disease instead of sugar.
*  You know about that, right?
*  I know that sugar is bad for people.
*  But did you know that scientists were bribed by the sugar industry?
*  This has been proved. The New York Times wrote a whole story about it.
*  And we already said they never lie.
*  I think we didn't quite come to that conclusion.
*  That's what we said. But you do know that they did that, right?
*  That it has been proven.
*  No, I don't know that.
*  I don't believe it's been proven that sugar causes heart disease.
*  There might've been a bribe.
*  No, no, no. That's not what I said. Yes. That's what I said.
*  That the sugar industry bribed scientists to
*  try to alter public opinion and show that it was saturated
*  fat that was causing heart disease and take the blame off of sugar.
*  I do believe that saturated fat is a contributing factor to heart disease.
*  And I believe the evidence is pretty overwhelming.
*  50 years ago, sugar industry quietly paid scientists to point blame at fat.
*  So what? Well, that's a big deal, man.
*  It changed the way people think about diet because people were saying,
*  oh my God, saturated fat is giving you heart disease.
*  And they were, okay, but this is why people started thinking this way.
*  They were thinking this way because of the sugar industry,
*  the sugar industry, bribing scientists.
*  Regardless of whether or not, but right now,
*  regardless of whether or not we agree or disagree on anything else,
*  you don't have to admit that this is a giant issue.
*  You don't think the dairy industry, the egg industry and the cattle industry
*  bribe scientists. They, they, they do.
*  I would like you to show me some studies.
*  Oh my God.
*  They see how we can do this. They find how we can both do this. Sure.
*  They, they fund studies. Yes, they do.
*  In order to try to prove their products are healthy for people.
*  They fund studies to try to prove their products are healthy,
*  but do they bribe scientists to lie?
*  Joe, no one is defending the sugar industry. Right. I think you're,
*  I think you're making a logical fallacy.
*  The fact that the sugar industry acted unethically that proves that saturated
*  fat doesn't cause heart disease or contribute to it.
*  It changes the perception of people when it comes to meat and health.
*  And I think it did. And I think it has ever since then. The people,
*  saw this and read this and point in their mind,
*  meat became saturated fat, saturated fat became heart disease,
*  and it became a dangerous thing to eat too much meat.
*  So here's an interesting question for you.
*  How much do you think total animal food consumption has gone up in the United
*  States per capita in the last 80 years?
*  I would assume it's probably pretty high. Yeah, it's gone way up.
*  Because we have more access to food, right? With factory farming and,
*  we are eating fast food. We are eating more animal foods than ever before.
*  Right. We're also eating more vegetable seed oils.
*  So the sugar industry failed.
*  The sugar industry failed in its task to get people to stop eating meat.
*  No it didn't because the task wasn't to try to get people to stop eating meat.
*  It was to get people to not worry about eating sugar and consume more sugar and
*  not have any fear about the health consequences of consuming sugar because it
*  wasn't sugar that was giving people heart disease. It was fat.
*  Nobody's defending sugar in this discussion.
*  I am certainly not defending sugar.
*  That's why they bribe people.
*  They didn't bribe people so that people would hate fat.
*  They bribe people so it would take the blame off of sugar.
*  I already concede that point,
*  but it doesn't make saturated fat good for people.
*  In large quantities it's not, clearly not.
*  And I will send you studies on it.
*  And actually I've got it in my book and I've got studies quoted in the book.
*  Well, I don't know if that's true. You know, I mean,
*  there's been a lot of people that have eaten what they call a carnivore diet
*  and reversed a lot of symptoms that they've had with auto immune diseases.
*  And there's different people that have different reactions to foods.
*  There's certain people that eat nuts and they get deathly ill.
*  There's certain people that eat them and they they're very healthy.
*  It's true.
*  There's people that have vegan diets and they don't have any problems with it.
*  And there's other people that have severe issues with it.
*  That's true. There's diversity.
*  And there may not be one diet that could solve all human problems.
*  No, I don't think there is. I don't think anybody would say there is anybody
*  that's being ethical and honest. I think human beings,
*  biodiversity in human beings is pretty extreme, you know,
*  depending upon where your ancestors came from,
*  depending upon what body type and blood type, there's a lot of different issues.
*  That's my problem.
*  I don't think that you can say that a plant based diet is the right diet for
*  everybody or that it's good for everybody.
*  I didn't say that. I don't say it in my book.
*  I mean, you did say it's the only diet that's been shown to reverse heart
*  disease and I don't really think it has.
*  But the burden of the burden of proof is to give me one study where it's not
*  where that's not true. Well, so I've, I've made the claim. Prove me wrong.
*  There's a lot of factors that led to reversing that heart disease.
*  And I think when you look at all those factors,
*  particularly the eliminating sugar that we know is a toxic substance,
*  the adding of exercise, the eliminating of oils,
*  all these different things that we know are not good for you.
*  I think those are contributing factors. If you wanted to say,
*  it's been shown that a whole foods plant based diet plus eliminating all these
*  toxic things have been shown to reverse heart disease.
*  I'd be right there with you.
*  Good. That's what I'm saying. Everybody eliminates that part, including you.
*  Now you left that out. Well, when you said it, you said whole food, plant based diet.
*  You didn't say eliminating all these things that have known dish that have been
*  shown to cause heart disease.
*  What is a whole foods diet?
*  You go to whole foods and you fill your shopping cart.
*  A whole food diet is actual whole foods, fruits, vegetables, beans.
*  So it's not sugar. It's not oil. So when I say a whole foods, plant based diet,
*  I mean no sugar, no refined grains, no oil,
*  none of the shit that you're talking about. That's what a whole foods.
*  Plus exercise.
*  These people eliminated all these things that they were eating before that gave
*  them heart disease.
*  Esselstyn studies were only dietary based. He did.
*  It was a whole foods, plant based low fat diet.
*  And if you read my chapter on heart disease and the whole foods diet,
*  you know what? I'd love to have this conversation with you some other time,
*  but even the diet based, you're still eliminating all these toxic things.
*  Exactly. That's a good thing.
*  So no one has proven that a whole foods,
*  plant based diet along with those toxic things.
*  Like if you had all of the good foods that we know, whether it's, you know,
*  animal foods, mollusks, all those different things,
*  if we could just all come to an agreement,
*  there's things that people eat that we've been eating particularly over the last
*  few decades in this country that are just bad for you.
*  The problem is we get into these ideological discussions of meat versus
*  plants.
*  And this is where things people tend to sort of gravitate
*  towards one side or the other and ignore all the different,
*  the different aspects of this conversation.
*  Like what we're talking about here with eliminating sugar, exercise.
*  If you said a whole foods, plant based diet,
*  plus adding exercise and eliminating foods that we know to be toxic is better
*  for you. There's not a single person who's going to argue that.
*  The problem is everybody says it's a whole food, plant based diet,
*  that this is what's doing the good,
*  but it's I think what's doing the good is a lot of things. So exercise,
*  eliminating toxic foods like sugar and all those vegetable oils and all the
*  bullshit.
*  Well whole foods diet eliminates those things. So that's redundant.
*  If it's a whole foods diet,
*  it's not going to have sugar refined grains or oil in it because those aren't
*  whole foods.
*  Understood. But the problem is what I do want,
*  I'm going to put those people were taking those,
*  those consuming those bad things before.
*  I want, I want to put this challenge to you.
*  I want you to just,
*  because I think call with Elselston's work on heart disease is worth looking at
*  for you because he didn't do anything but diet.
*  So he didn't have exercise in it. His program, he didn't have stress reduction.
*  He didn't have meditation or anything else in there.
*  He just had diet. It was a whole foods, plant based, low fat diet.
*  It did reverse heart disease. It's so he's,
*  but clearly eliminated all those other aspects.
*  It's a whole foods, plant based diet. So no toxins. Cause those are my whole
*  foods. Right. So let me, let me,
*  this is the thing is like, that's the convenient,
*  that's the thing that's conveniently left out.
*  You can say a whole foods plant based diet, but it's not just that it's
*  eliminating toxic food. It's not just eating good food.
*  So what we need to do,
*  what you need to do or you need to come up with some evidence or somebody needs
*  to do that you can throw in my face is a whole foods meat based diet has,
*  with eliminates all these toxins will also reverse heart disease. Right.
*  You can do that. Then I'll, I'll,
*  Hey, we remember how we talked about beliefs earlier that they're just a suit
*  of clothes.
*  You produce that evidence and I'll take off the suit of clothes because I,
*  I'm actually about being intellectually have an intellectual integrity.
*  I've come to my conclusions based on my own dispassionate study.
*  So if you produce the evidence, I'll probably change my mind.
*  What do you think? What do you think people are doing wrong when they're eating
*  a vegan diet and they have all these health problems?
*  They're eating a junk food, vegan diet. They're not eating a whole foods,
*  vegan diet. They're eating junk food. That's a,
*  they're eating all these toxic foods that we're talking about.
*  That's not everybody. Chris Helmsworth was eating like he was having,
*  having vegan. Um, uh,
*  he was having like plant based shakes in the morning and eating whole foods and
*  he started developing all these kidney stones and had a lot of problems with
*  oxalates.
*  I have no idea if he's having a lot of problem. I oxalates.
*  Chances are he was eating a lot of a huge amount of green green leafy
*  vegetables. Sure. Yeah.
*  I was in eating in two larger quantities as oxalates and it could cause problems
*  in your kidneys. So all I know is that I've been doing this.
*  Wasn't Chris Helmsworth. It was Liam, right? The other, which, which one's Thor?
*  Thor's Chris. Yeah. It's the other one. Liam.
*  Which one's Thor? I love it.
*  You gotta go that way.
*  So
*  but what, what we, Joe, what we agree on, let's go back to what we agree on.
*  What we agree on is we should be not eating all this crap. Yes.
*  We agree. We agree on that.
*  And I think we agree that we should eat lots of fruits and vegetables.
*  Yes. Yes. Sure.
*  Then we agree on 90% of it.
*  Then it's a question of how much animal foods are good for us.
*  And that's where we're, that's where we may differ,
*  but probably we're not even that far apart there because I'm saying you can eat
*  some animal foods and have a really healthy, healthy diet and lifestyle.
*  It's a question of how much. And at some certain point,
*  I believe that the, the, the saturated fats,
*  the cholesterol from the animal foods will begin to clog up your arteries.
*  And it's not that they cause cancer, but they can be,
*  I believe cancer promoters at least.
*  You know, there's also been proven as a big issue with eating cholesterol along
*  with simple carbohydrates and things like processed foods.
*  Since we agree on the simple carbohydrates, we don't,
*  I don't have to argue about that anymore. You and I, we are simpatico.
*  We sync up on that cut to sugar out, cut the cut thick. What about oil?
*  How do you feel about that one?
*  Well, I'm not a big fan of vegetable oils. Good. Yeah.
*  Is there any other kind of oil?
*  Yeah. I mean you can have animal based oils. I mean, you can,
*  I actually cook in beef. Oh, you mean like booth beef tallow and butter. Yeah.
*  I was thinking those weren't oils, but they're fat. Yeah. Well,
*  beef tallow renders down into oil, right? It's, um,
*  I think that there's a lot of people consuming a lot of processed shit.
*  I think this is where we absolutely meet in the middle,
*  whether it's vegetable processed shit. Like I have a friend who's vegan,
*  who eats all kinds of wacky vegan delights,
*  all these little treats and all this. I'm like, read this fucking ingredients.
*  It's garbage.
*  Preservatives and nonsense and the, but it's vegan.
*  So it's it's ideologically acceptable. Right. You know,
*  things fall into these, they fall into these little groups like this,
*  this, this aligns with my religion. So I'm going to eat this.
*  There are plenty on the, on the, uh, paleo keto.
*  There's lots of little groups on the animal food side too. Sure. So everybody,
*  it's almost like diet. In fact,
*  this might be a more interesting discussion than you and I batten each other
*  about this one.
*  It's interesting to me how many sort of little cults there are in food now.
*  There are all these little nutritional food cults and, uh, it's, uh,
*  and everybody thinks they're right. It's almost like a religion.
*  Well, diet is religion.
*  You're eating one way and you hope you're right. And if you, you know,
*  the problem with eating, right,
*  is that if you're eating something and it's good for you,
*  it takes a while before you feel it. You're not sure.
*  And then also there's a mind fuck going on. You know,
*  a lot of people that get into a certain diet, whether it's keto or other,
*  I tried keto for a while. There's,
*  there's certain things that you do where you start mind fucking yourself,
*  that you're on the right path. And I do feel better. I feel better. But you know,
*  there's people that do that with faith healing. You know,
*  it's hard for people to decide what makes them feel better.
*  There's holistic fake medicines that people like, uh,
*  what is that stuff called? What are those homeopathic homeopathic medicines that
*  they're fucking sugar pills. There's literally nothing to them.
*  And yet people take them and they claim they feel better. Chiropractors. Oh,
*  I feel better. I feel better.
*  Well I do see a chiropractor. I do feel better.
*  Do you know where how chiropractors were invented? It doesn't matter.
*  I'm magnetic healer who came up with it in a seance in the 1800s came up with
*  this idea that by adjusting people's spines,
*  you're going to fix all these illnesses.
*  And so do you know that when you go to a chiropractor or doctors came from,
*  they used to bleed people, but they don't anymore. You know that, right?
*  Do you know the chiropractors doctors? Like when you go to a doctor of
*  chiropractic, they, how much time do you think they spent in medical school?
*  Well, they didn't go to medical school. They go to zero, zero medical school.
*  How many nutrition classes did doctors take in medical school?
*  They don't take much. About eight hours.
*  That's why you go to a nutritionist and not a standard American doctor.
*  But when you go to a chiropractor, they call themselves a doctor.
*  Or they're a doctor of chiropractic. Right.
*  And it was invested by a magnetic healer who was killed by his son.
*  His son ran him over in a car. His son was a con man.
*  And that's the guy who went up spreading this whole religion of chiropractic
*  medicine, adjusting babies and shit.
*  I don't think it's religion, but clearly you don't go to chiropractors.
*  I've been, I do. I've had good, I had saw a chiropractor today. In fact,
*  yeah, it feels good. Right. Crack, crack, pop, pop. It feels like something,
*  but this feels good too. I just did that with my knuckles.
*  I chiropracted my knuckles.
*  I can't do that anymore.
*  He just did it. There you go. Wow. How about that? Wow. Amazing.
*  But my point is that there's no evidence that that is doing anything to you
*  physically. If you go to a doctor, okay. And you have a serious issue,
*  like you've got a broken arm and they have to put, you know,
*  plates in it and screw it in place and put it in a cast.
*  There's real evidence that that works. They've shown it. They've healed people.
*  Yeah. So doctors can, are pretty good at healing bones.
*  They're not too good with cancer. They're not too good with heart disease.
*  They're a lot better with cancer than they've ever been ever in history.
*  They're closing in on fixing that. In fact,
*  there was an article just today that there was, I think it's in Israel.
*  They figured out a way to have genes that
*  actively go after like surgically go after cancer.
*  There was an article and was it scientific American?
*  There was an article today about a fantastic breakthrough in cancer therapy.
*  CRISPR. Yes.
*  They're using CRISPR to do this and they figured out a way to actively target
*  the way they described it was surgical revolutionary CRISPR. Yeah.
*  CRISPR based genome editing system treatment destroys cancer cells.
*  Breakthrough may increase life expectancy in brain and ovarian cancer. See?
*  So you can't say that doctors are not good at treating cancer because they're
*  constantly working on it.
*  And they're making breakthroughs like this all the time.
*  That's just a theoretical breakthrough and I hope it's correct. But Hey Joe,
*  here's the reality.
*  Hold on. That's not theoretical.
*  Researchers have demonstrated that CRISPR Cas9 system is very effective in
*  treating metastatic cancers,
*  a significant step on the way to finding a cure for cancer.
*  The researchers developed a novel lipid nanoparticle based delivery system that
*  specifically targets cancer cells and destroys them by genetic manipulation.
*  They practice this on animals. This is not like a theory.
*  This is something they're actually doing with CRISPR.
*  I'm I'm all for it, but I haven't seen it yet. Mind you,
*  look around. Mind you. Well, here's the reality.
*  The reality is is that we spend 80% of our healthcare dollars on lifestyle
*  dietary diseases. The doctors can't help us with it all.
*  You can say there's a cure for cancer.
*  The best way is to have a strong immune system because we get cancer all the
*  time and our immune system just deals with it.
*  Yeah, but there's babies that get cancer. You know,
*  a cancer is a genetic issue. Sometimes people have a systemic, like their,
*  their, their body has a vulnerability to cancers.
*  And the reality is that baby suck it up and have a better diet. All,
*  all biological carbon based life forms have a propensity or animals have a
*  propensity to cancer. Right.
*  But that's why it's fascinating when doctors and researchers can come up with
*  treatments, novel treatments like this.
*  So to say that doctors and chiropractors are on the same tier.
*  I didn't say that.
*  But you that's the example you used when I was talking about how chiropractors
*  are full of shit. I don't, I don't have the same,
*  I don't hold doctors in the same high esteem that you do.
*  I've worked with lots of doctors and they generally don't know what they're
*  talking about. Oh man. How can you say that?
*  Because so many doctors that are experts in their field, they've helped people.
*  You know, you're talking about the sugar industry, bribing somebody,
*  the pharmaceutical industry bribes doctors every single year,
*  all their continuing education or these junkets to golf golf resorts and where
*  they get continuing education about the new wonders of these drugs that except
*  for vaccinations and antibiotics,
*  most of these drugs don't cure anything. They just deal with symptoms.
*  Well,
*  I agree with you on that and I agree with you that there is a gigantic problem
*  with pharmaceutical industries having influence over doctors.
*  My wife's mom's a nurse and she would tell us stories about how these
*  pharmaceutical companies would take everybody out to dinner and these fancy
*  restaurants and pay for everything. And they weren't bribing you,
*  but they kind of were. That is kind of a bribe. It's kind of a bribe.
*  And they would let you know, like, Hey, you know,
*  if someone comes in and they got this problem, we got this and reciprocity.
*  I do you a favor. You do me a favor. Yeah, it's sneaky. And they,
*  they'd send you on trips and you know,
*  to go on these conferences that these pharmaceutical companies would put
*  together. No, I agree with you. There's,
*  there's certainly some influence that the pharmaceutical companies have over
*  doctors. And certainly there's,
*  there's an unpleasant exchange that goes on between them.
*  But to say that doctors aren't doing any good is crazy.
*  I didn't say they aren't doing any good. You're, I didn't say that.
*  How'd you say it? I just, I just said,
*  I think you don't have a lot of faith in them. Yeah. I mean, for,
*  if you have look doctors, if you have first aid, if I,
*  if I have cuts and I need stitches, I want to, I want to orthopedic surgeon.
*  If you have a blown knee. Absolutely. Hey,
*  I've had both of my hips resurfaced. Oh, you have?
*  And I found the best surgeon in America, I think that to do that.
*  How'd you blow out your hips? You know, we don't really know. Probably,
*  the doctor thought I played competitive basketball in high school, college,
*  and city league for years. And he thinks that I had a,
*  I was really small when I, when I got to high school,
*  I was only five feet tall and I grew about a foot in a couple of years.
*  And he says that there's a disease that when you're growing that rapidly,
*  and if you have a lot of contact in the hip area,
*  like you might get from martial arts or you might get from football or
*  basketball from jumping and all that lateral movement that my hips were not
*  quite in the socket. So my cartilage wore out prematurely.
*  And I was bone on bone when I got the surgeries done. But you know what?
*  A miracle. I don't have any real pain in my hips occasionally,
*  but for the most part I'm, I'm pain free doctors. So to make clear surgeons.
*  I mean, if you need surgery, you need first aid, like a broken bone.
*  No, I think, I think we're on the same page.
*  What you're saying is that doctors over prescribe medication and under
*  prescribed healthy living and diet and doing all the things that we
*  know to be positive for the, for the human body.
*  Exactly. No, I, I agree with you.
*  Cause they don't get enough training and I don't get enough training in, in,
*  in healthy living. No, that's a fact. Like I had a conversation with the doctor
*  where he's telling me, you don't need vitamin supplementation. You just,
*  you know, just eat a good diet. You know,
*  like what's a good diet where you're going to get vitamin D three,
*  a business model that I'm kicking around investing in would be a business model
*  where you have doctors and you have a whole team.
*  So Joe Rogan goes in there.
*  We do the complete workup of everything about your blood, your total health.
*  And then we began to customize our ideas to get you to live an extra 10 or 15
*  years and increase your health span. How can we optimize Joe Rogan?
*  How can we optimize your health and wellbeing and a team of people that are
*  working with you, studying you, you're paying a monthly fee to get this.
*  It's kind of concierge medicine,
*  but not just dealing with getting a prescription from this doc.
*  So you can get your Viagra or whatever from the doctor.
*  It'd be about,
*  about them optimizing your long-term health and wellbeing.
*  I think that could be, I think that is going to be a big future business model.
*  Then you would have to have people actually go out and do things like Mike,
*  you're going to have to work out.
*  Yes. Well, think about it. We have personal trainers.
*  We have executive coaches that corporate leaders frequently get.
*  Why not have a wellness coach who's with a team of a doctor and wellness
*  coaches who are helping you to optimize your absolute peak performance that you
*  can get.
*  Have you thought about implementing something like that for employees at
*  Whole Foods?
*  I have thought about that. It's pretty expensive to do it.
*  That would be the problem, right? One thing we do at Whole Foods though,
*  if you work for the company, we gave you a 20% discount for being a team member,
*  but then we measure your four biometrics.
*  If you're interested to get a higher discount, you're, if you don't smoke,
*  if you smoke, you're, if you, we detect nicotine in your blood and you're out.
*  You can't, we don't. And then it's about your body mass index.
*  And a man is big and it's you, we do a height to waist ratio.
*  So that you wouldn't be penalized for being.
*  Yeah, I'm obese.
*  By a BMI measurement, but not by a height to rate waist ratio.
*  So we do it both ways and give you the benefit of whichever one you get the best
*  score on.
*  Why don't just do their body fat so you know that it's just muscle.
*  A little harder to measure because the cost of doing the test.
*  Calipers. Yeah, that's, that's not that big a deal.
*  And they also, they've things now that electro magnet or whatever it is,
*  they hold onto these handles and it shoots.
*  So maybe we need to examine how we could do that more effectively.
*  But we also do blood pressure and cholesterol.
*  And then, and then based on how you score on those,
*  you can get up to a 30% discount based on your overall health.
*  So we create an incentive for our people.
*  Oh, that's great. So the people that shop at whole foods that work there,
*  get a giant discount.
*  They get already, they already get a giant discount at 20%.
*  They could get an additional 10% if they're healthy.
*  They could get, we have four different levels.
*  So we call a bronze, silver and gold levels.
*  What do you have to do to get gold?
*  What do you have to do? You have to have a BMI that's under 24
*  cholesterol. That's either total cholesterol under 150 or LDL under
*  80. I think that's a, that's a hot button debate. Blood, blood pressure.
*  I think I don't want to have that debate with you right now.
*  No, it's not me, man. It's a carnivore MD. This guy, Paul Saladino had this,
*  and then blood pressure under 115 and under 75, 115 of 75.
*  And what do you get if you hit gold?
*  To get gold, your blood pressure, 120 over 80, your cholesterol.
*  No, but what do you get like in front for gold? You're going to get a plat,
*  bronze, silver, gold platinum platinum. Platinum is the highest level.
*  You get 30% discount. Oh, that's a sweet discount. Gold's 27.
*  Silver's 24 and 22 for bronze.
*  That's nice. So you incentivize people to make healthy choices.
*  Do you give them any sort of a gym membership or something along those lines?
*  That would help. Right? That's a good idea. We haven't done that. Yeah.
*  What if, what if you had a thing at whole foods where you had a small gym
*  attached to whole foods. We offered classes for employees.
*  Take some of that Jeff Bezos money. Yeah. The problem is,
*  the problem is we actually do locate close to gyms and sometimes our storage
*  workout deals with the gyms to get some people to use the gym. Oh, that's great.
*  But having, having a gym on every store would be expensive.
*  We don't even have one in our corporate offices, although we're thinking about,
*  how do you not have a gym in your corporate office?
*  I think it's the egalitarian culture.
*  Would it be fair for the people at global support to have a gym when the people
*  in the stores don't have one? I understand, but.
*  We have the same benefits for all our team members, regardless of where they work.
*  Oh really? Yeah. Oh, that's very nice. If you're a cashier at whole foods,
*  you got the same benefits. I do.
*  What do you do personally in terms of exercise and,
*  and to make sure that you stay healthy?
*  So when I was younger,
*  I played competitive basketball and I was a runner for a long time.
*  And now I'm a long distance backpacker.
*  Oh, you're rocking.
*  Yup. I've, I've hiked the Appalachian trail twice.
*  Have you really? Jesus Christ Pacific crest trail.
*  Isn't that like months? The first time I did it, I took a,
*  I took a sabbatical four and a half months.
*  You took a four and a half months sabbatical to walk.
*  Yeah. It was great. It was so fun. That's so crazy.
*  Made a ton of friends. The guys I met on that trail.
*  I still go hiking with every year. Really? Back in 2000.
*  It's kind of like being in the Marines.
*  You had this deep bonding you have with people.
*  Well, you know, you're walking all the way across the continent.
*  You get so frigging fit. Oh, and imagine. Even when I got into Maine,
*  I was still getting fitter. But you know what?
*  As soon as you stop hiking 10 hours a day, it goes away. It goes away pretty quickly.
*  I've traveled with people that work on ranches and you try to keep up with them.
*  And like you just, your ankles want to fall off.
*  Because they're moving all the time. They're constantly doing it.
*  They're this it's and for them, it's not even a workout.
*  It's a normal part of their everyday life.
*  So their legs are just totally conditioned to be able to hike up those hills
*  and walk constantly.
*  People don't realize like how difficult hiking is.
*  So like, what do you do for exercise? Oh, I go hiking like, oh, slacker.
*  Like hiking is hard, man.
*  Depends on how how it could be.
*  If you go for a 30 minute walk around the neighborhood, it's not too hard.
*  But the Appalachian Trail, that is another level.
*  You know, it's it's it's wonderful.
*  I love being out in nature.
*  That's if you ask me what my favorite form of recreation is,
*  it's getting out into nature.
*  Some form or fashion.
*  I I love I love hiking and I love long distance backpacking.
*  And I do it ultra light.
*  So, I mean, it's like I've got it down to a science.
*  So when you say backpacking, so you're sleeping out there in the wilderness.
*  The whole deal. Yeah, absolutely.
*  Now, there's not a lot of CEOs that are willing to do that.
*  I don't know.
*  But remember the other second time I hiked it, I did it in over four years
*  because I couldn't take that much time off when I retire.
*  Sometime the next few years.
*  If I go hiking, I'm going to go hiking a lot.
*  I'm going to be on those trails.
*  There's so many people right now that are aspiring CEOs
*  that want to be some big time baller like you.
*  And they hear this like, oh, when when when I retire, I'm going to go walking.
*  They're like, fuck you.
*  Well, you're supposed to be out there ballin.
*  You're supposed to be on a yacht and.
*  Doing crazy shit.
*  Well, I may do some of that, too.
*  I'm not mutually exclusive.
*  I can only I can't hike 12 months a year.
*  So I like that.
*  I can do some of that other stuff that are not mutually exclusive.
*  Now, when you do it, do you ultra light camp to you bring like a very light tent?
*  And yeah.
*  So like my base weight before food and water is about six and a half pounds.
*  And so that's pretty light.
*  And my tent weighs 12 ounces.
*  My backpack itself weighs about 14 ounces.
*  And my sleeping bag is going to weigh about 20, 21 ounces.
*  And how do you know how much food to bring?
*  And do you have that time out?
*  Like, I know how far you walk.
*  You have to plan it out.
*  So and when you're going to resupply.
*  But in general, I'm going to consume about.
*  Pound and a half to two pounds of food a day.
*  And so I have to and I just I know how much I need to take each day.
*  Do you bring do you bring bars?
*  Do you bring whole food?
*  Like, what do you bring?
*  And the first couple of days, I'll definitely take some whole foods like apples,
*  maybe even some snap peas and peanut butters and stuff like that.
*  Yeah, I do. I do.
*  I do a lot of high calorie stuff here.
*  Yeah, I do a lot of nut butters trail mix.
*  I also.
*  I have avocados,
*  some, you know, whole food, whole grain crackers, things like that.
*  But then once you're a few days in, you kind of can't do that anymore
*  because you're not don't have access to supermarkets.
*  I also might take a sandwich out for the first day
*  or some hummus or something like that.
*  Why don't you have to parachute you healthy foods down?
*  Well, what I will actually do is
*  what most people do is they they mail drops, have somebody mail drop the food.
*  What I generally do is I usually have a car support
*  that I meet up with every once or twice a week and then get resupply that.
*  Oh, OK. That's good.
*  And I have to say, I'd like to spend one take one day a week off and
*  go into a town, get a massage,
*  eat some town food, which tastes really good after you've been on the trail food.
*  Is it hard to find vegetarian foods when you go to these towns?
*  You know, I would say it used to be when I when I hiked the Appalachian Trail
*  the first time in 2002.
*  So it was pretty hard back then.
*  But there's there's plant based foods everywhere.
*  But if you're exhausted, don't you want to meet love?
*  Graving? I know this will surprise you, but I have I have lost my taste for it.
*  No, it's not surprising at all.
*  When you get used to certain types of diets, like that's what your body seems to.
*  Yeah, you know, that's one of the big learnings I have about food in general is
*  we will like whatever food we eat.
*  So we I've reeducated my palate.
*  When I was a kid, I ate the standard American diet junk food.
*  Right. I just say crap.
*  Cocoa puffs for breakfast, sweet rolls,
*  burgers and fries, shakes, you know, stuff that still most Americans eat.
*  And I didn't eat any any vegetables at all.
*  None zero. None pickles on a burger.
*  That was it. Wow.
*  And then it's hardcore. Yeah.
*  But then when I when I began to wake up dieterrally and nutritionally,
*  I taught myself to like every type of plant food.
*  I like every kind of plant food, because once you expose your palate
*  to a food about 10 times or so, you'll start to like it.
*  Well, I would 100 percent say that the standard American diet
*  is fucking terrible for you.
*  I think that it's a real problem and access and people are hungry.
*  If you're just driving around, they should have some sort of a vegetarian
*  based fast food that's good for you.
*  How come no one's figured that out yet?
*  Because there's all these jack in the box.
*  And so a couple of McDonald's
*  or a couple of points.
*  It's a real problem because statistically now 70 percent of Americans
*  adults are overweight and 42 and a half percent of Americans are obese.
*  Forty two and a half. That's crazy.
*  It's crazy. It's almost a crazy number.
*  And by the way, it's getting worse.
*  We have not peaked yet.
*  It could be 50 percent in another five or six or seven years.
*  It's incredible. So we're we're escalating.
*  Yes, we're escalating.
*  This is a this is a crisis in America.
*  We are eating ourselves to death.
*  And it's mostly the things we agree about.
*  Yeah. Junk.
*  Yeah. Sugar. Sugar. Garbage. Garbage. Yeah.
*  So here's here's what I believe.
*  Evolutionary is what's happened to humanity.
*  So when we were out foraging, which we did for tens of thousands
*  and hundreds of thousands of years, we were hunters and gatherers
*  or gatherers and hunters.
*  Our real problem was getting enough food.
*  That's always been humanity's major problem.
*  And so we've evolved a palette that craves calorie dense foods.
*  We like food that has a lot of calories in it.
*  It tastes really good.
*  And but we just couldn't get it in nature.
*  Maybe you could occasionally get you could pull down a wild game.
*  Occasionally you can hunt it, eat it, gorge on it,
*  because you need as much as you could, because you couldn't preserve it well.
*  It still was kind of lean, gamey stuff, right?
*  Because they weren't they weren't being fattened up on corn like the
*  like the pork and chickens and beef that we eat today.
*  Or we get honey, for example, we might get a couple of hundred
*  bee stings if we could get that delicious honey.
*  But it was just scarce.
*  And so we crave it.
*  And that's our problem.
*  That's our genetics are working against us because we can eat
*  calorie dense food every single meal every day of our lives.
*  And we just get fatter and fatter and fatter.
*  And that's our that's our existential dilemma that not just Americans,
*  the whole world, we've exported the American diet across the world.
*  So many said this to me once, and it really resonated like that.
*  This is the only time ever where poor people are fat.
*  Exactly. There's never been a time in history where you could be poor and fat.
*  It used to be the rich people were fat and the poor people eat the traditional diet.
*  They were not getting enough calories, so they were thin.
*  It's almost reversed itself today.
*  A lot of the more richer people, they hire personal trainers.
*  They learn more about food.
*  They eat whole foods, whether it be plant based or meats or both.
*  And they just take better care of themselves.
*  It's such a catch 22 for folks, too, because when you're tired
*  and you're exhausted and a lot of times when people have poor nutrition,
*  they're tired and they're exhausted.
*  It's very difficult to manage your your appetite.
*  Like when I'm tired, I have to stay the fuck out of the kitchen.
*  That's with me.
*  Like last night, I was tired.
*  I worked out pretty hard and I'm a glutton.
*  I have a real problem.
*  I eat way too much.
*  I sit down, I'll gorge myself and I'm like, stop, stop.
*  And I keep eating, especially pasta.
*  I have a giant problem with pasta.
*  I will just get fat as fuck if I can eat all the pasta I want.
*  I don't I just can't stop myself.
*  Like if I have a big bowl of spaghetti, I just keep shoving it in my face.
*  Even after I'm full.
*  If I eat meat, I will stop when I'm full.
*  Like it's it's it's the satiety, whatever it is, you know, the
*  whatever causes you to be satisfied by consuming it.
*  I'm good. But fucking pasta, I will just keep going.
*  So if you're eating typical white pasta, that's a very calorie dense food.
*  Doesn't have any fiber in it.
*  I think part of what creates satiety is fiber.
*  So when you're eating lots of fruits, vegetables.
*  Then why does steak make you so satisfied?
*  That's because of the
*  fat also creates satiety.
*  If we don't eat it too fast.
*  So we we get it's like this fat sends a signal to our systems to say,
*  wow, that's that's a big load I've got in there.
*  So fat does a similar type thing.
*  Fiber does it, though, without the calorie load.
*  So I eat I eat a I eat a lot.
*  I also eat a lot of food, but I've just I'm just eating a lot of fiber.
*  I bet if you and I sat down, you'd be astonished at how much I eat.
*  When you think a lot, what you think of it as a lot.
*  I eat a stupid amount of food, man.
*  Well, you're you're you're working it off somehow.
*  And somehow barely.
*  I exercise sometimes just to keep from getting too fat.
*  But my problem, my my number one problem is pasta.
*  There is something about that food in particular, pasta with tomato sauce.
*  I can just eat it until I explode.
*  You need to keep that out of your house then.
*  Yeah, I should. But I don't.
*  That's also a problem. I shop when I'm hungry.
*  Yeah, that's not good.
*  You are you are you are just the kind of customer Whole Foods likes.
*  Yeah, I walked down that cookie aisle.
*  You guys have some awesome vegan cookies.
*  By the way, this is why you're you see that this
*  you're tempted by these foods that are actually really unhealthy for you.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah.
*  I think this this is good because we all are. Yeah.
*  We are tempted.
*  We're tempted by these calorie dense foods.
*  But once you're aware that calorie density isn't our friend,
*  then we can start making different choices.
*  You guys have these vegan cookies.
*  Who makes these goddamn cookies?
*  It's like Auntie something's they come in a brown paper bag.
*  Uncle Eddie's uncle Eddie's vegan cookies.
*  No, you got to think it's an auntie.
*  Maybe there is an uncle Eddie.
*  Vegan cook is it on a brown bag.
*  Uncle Eddie's.
*  I guess maybe it is uncle Eddie's.
*  There it is. That's it.
*  Oh, those those.
*  There's a peanut butter chocolate chip one.
*  That is why I think it was on tea because I assume that's a woman
*  because they say so good.
*  I assume it's like someone's aunt cook.
*  So she'll like this.
*  The only time I really eat that food is when I'm going on a long distance hike
*  and trying to get enough calories is a problem because I'm hiking 10,
*  12 hours a day and burning 5000 calories.
*  And I've got to I got to get more calories than me.
*  My my wife says, John,
*  you should admit to the world that they're really the only reason you like to go
*  backpacking is because it gives you the excuse
*  that you crave to eat crappy food.
*  That's not crappy. The delicious.
*  They're just not something you should eat all the time.
*  They're just not held.
*  Find the peanut butter chocolate chip ones.
*  Those are the jam.
*  I eat those with whole milk.
*  Big glass of milk and dunk those suckers in there.
*  I know you don't fuck with milk.
*  I hate to tell you this, but you know, when I get when I need a snack like that,
*  I just eat an apple.
*  Oh, how boring.
*  Oh, apples are apples are so good.
*  I love apples.
*  I'm just joking. I eat apples before I work out.
*  It's my favorite pre workout food
*  because I work out generally early in the morning.
*  And if I'm tired and I'm like, God, I need something, I need something.
*  I almost always go with an apple.
*  That's it right there. Look at that.
*  Those are the ones.
*  And if you're a vegan, you could partake.
*  You won't have the milk.
*  You could drink it with some bullshit almond milk.
*  What is that crazy curse? Are you doing?
*  I just zoomed in instead of taking the way.
*  Look how good that is.
*  Those are so good.
*  Those are those are very good.
*  And but with Joe, that's that's your enemy.
*  It is. It is my enemy.
*  Uncle Eddie is not your friend.
*  Well, I don't have it a lot, but I do.
*  You said you come home and I start devouring pasta and pasta.
*  I have that stuff once, maybe twice a year.
*  I'll eat a bag of those like a whole bag.
*  That's the problem.
*  What else are you putting on?
*  What else are you putting on your pasta?
*  Just garlic and tomato sauce.
*  That's really what I like.
*  Are you using like a whole grain pasta?
*  You should use a whole grain pasta.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I'm eating what's bad for me.
*  I'm not.
*  When I'm eating pasta, I generally buy.
*  What is it? Double zero pasta from Italy.
*  I try to buy. I order it from Amazon.
*  Is that Italian, your background?
*  Yes. So you could got that.
*  You've got that excuse.
*  You got the genetic excuse.
*  I don't have the desire to cook lasagna.
*  And I'm very fortunate that I don't have that desire
*  because every now and then my wife will make lasagna.
*  And I if I come home, like especially if it's late at night
*  and I've just done stand up and I find lasagna in the fridge,
*  that lasagna doesn't have a fucking chance.
*  It's going down.
*  But I know it's bad for me.
*  You know, I know.
*  But those, you know,
*  carbohydrates in large, just large quantities like that.
*  I know it's bad for me.
*  You probably won't want to do this, but
*  my wife and I, we eat a brown rice pasta.
*  Tastes really good.
*  And and then homemade delicious pasta sauce,
*  a lot of garlic and onions and mushrooms.
*  And then we'll add that's on.
*  We'll add veggies on top of the pasta and then we'll drown it in the sauce.
*  It's really delicious.
*  It's not that many calories.
*  That doesn't sound too bad.
*  I actually like hemp pasta.
*  I've been eating a lot of hemp pasta.
*  It's very good.
*  Really? Yeah, it's guilt free.
*  Yeah. So it doesn't doesn't feel really nearly as bad for you.
*  But it's something I like about knowing that it's bad for me.
*  Is it really hemp pasta?
*  Is it just white pasta that has a little bit of hemp seed in it?
*  No, it's hemp. It's green.
*  It's like a green pasta.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  There's a few different brands that I purchase.
*  I wish I could remember the name, but I do not have it off hand.
*  But again, I buy that on Amazon.
*  I love hemp seeds, so I might try.
*  Oh, I love hemp seeds.
*  I love hemp protein.
*  Hemp protein powder is fantastic.
*  I use hemp seeds in my smoothies.
*  Hmm. It's good stuff.
*  And it's easy to digest.
*  And it's it's got all the amino acids.
*  It's one of the best, most complete proteins in terms of plants.
*  I know. Yeah.
*  Why? That's why I take it super easy for your body to digest.
*  There's something about hemp protein.
*  Like if I know I have to work out in an hour,
*  I hesitate with some forms of protein, like specifically whey,
*  like whey my body doesn't digest that well.
*  Tastes pretty good.
*  Like you can get a lot of like delicious whey protein supplements,
*  like powders and stuff.
*  But it's a gas factory.
*  It's it's maybe I'm going to make stomach.
*  May not agree with your particular bacteria, you know,
*  because the gas and all that stuff, you know, we we have a microbiome
*  that's increasingly become aware how important that is for our health.
*  Yeah. Like people that say they can't digest beans.
*  I say, well, because you've got to feed the bacteria that digest beans.
*  So if you always avoid beans,
*  you're not growing the bacteria to digest the beans.
*  But aren't there some people that just have a genetic propensity to have a.
*  I'm sure there's a genetic propensity for pretty much everything.
*  So there's that's a definite yes.
*  But people just can't fuck with beans.
*  Well, but what if I was their coach, I would say, you know what?
*  Beans are really healthy foods.
*  What we're going to do is we're going to first start with lentils.
*  We're going to just going to have you to a couple of tablespoons of lentils today.
*  And then we're going to what will happen over time is you feed the microbiome
*  and you'll get the type of bacteria that will be able to digest legumes.
*  And for example, I haven't had meat in so long
*  that I probably tried to eat some meat.
*  I probably wouldn't be able to digest it.
*  Probably be an ecstasy of cookie of an elk steak.
*  I might have enjoyed eating it, but my digestive system wouldn't be able to handle it
*  because I don't have the bacteria.
*  I'd have to regrow the bacteria to digest.
*  I wonder. Be interesting to watch.
*  You might love it so much.
*  You might go, what was I?
*  I was talking all kinds of crazy shit about not eating meat.
*  God, it's so good.
*  You know, I don't I know that you're I'm way past that.
*  I just don't have that craving any longer.
*  I believe you.
*  I've got it, though. I've got it for both of us.
*  You got it. And you got a pasta craving, too.
*  That's the one I need to get rid of.
*  But here's the thing, Joe, I think you're just a guy that's,
*  you know, you're just living a big life.
*  You know, you're just you're a big man.
*  You're living a big life.
*  You have a lot of passion.
*  You have a passion for life.
*  You have you have that's a nice way of saying a glutton.
*  Well, gluttons have a passion for life. Yes.
*  But you if you were just a glutton.
*  Yeah. And you weren't doing all these other amazing things,
*  then that would be a true accusation.
*  But you're sort of a glutton for life.
*  I am a glutton for life.
*  But if there is one part of my life, my personality that I'm embarrassed by,
*  it's my consumption of food that I shouldn't be eating.
*  Because when I start, like particularly pasta,
*  it's just I know I'm not supposed to do it.
*  It's the one thing that I know I'm not supposed to do.
*  I just keep doing it.
*  Well, you have to make a deal with your wife not to have it in the house.
*  There's no deals. I'm going to buy it.
*  But but you
*  so you know you're going to do things you don't want to do
*  and you have it around.
*  Well, while I'm enjoying it, that's the problem is the mouth pleasure
*  during the 15 minutes or so that I'm sitting down eating that bowl,
*  probably not even 15, probably five.
*  I mean, eating a big bowl of spaghetti, the mouth pleasure that I get,
*  I'm going to I'm going to there's times I'm just going to accept it.
*  And that's worth it to you.
*  The crazy thing is I will feel like shit for a full day afterwards.
*  Like I'm trading five minutes of mouth pleasure
*  for a full day of feeling like shit.
*  You know, I feel that way about about good red wine.
*  Ah, me too.
*  So so what I've learned, partly from my, you know, your
*  the watches that measure my sleep is whenever I consume any alcohol,
*  I don't sleep as long and I don't sleep as deep.
*  Yeah. And I see it now.
*  I see the statistics.
*  Me too. And when I don't drink, I sleep longer and deeper.
*  What do you use? What kind of watch you got?
*  This this is I I just switched over to this watch.
*  This is a core.
*  It's only three. 350 is a Coros Apex.
*  Those are really good. I've heard of those.
*  Well, I love about this is battery time, since I'm a long distance backpacker.
*  This one this one goes without recharging for about 30 days.
*  Whoa. How does it do that?
*  It's just got the most amazing battery.
*  And if I want to use it full GPS mode to to to on my hiking and whatnot,
*  I can get like four full days without having to charge.
*  That's incredible. It is.
*  A lot of those are good for a day, which is I know,
*  which is which is why I switched from the Apple Watch to this one,
*  because it does this.
*  And does it monitor your heart rate, sleep, all that jazz, everything,
*  everything the Apple Watch does.
*  Yeah, I use a whoop strap.
*  I use this thing, which is good for about five days.
*  And I do notice that when I drink my recovery shit.
*  But I'm telling this story because to me,
*  the real pleasure of something like red wine is when it's convivial,
*  when you're doing with friends
*  and you're going to have a long conversation and you're going to laugh
*  and you're going to joke and you're going to tell stories
*  and you're just going to have a lot of fun.
*  For me, red wine enhances that conviviality.
*  And I'm willing to make the trade off occasionally.
*  I'm not sleeping as well.
*  How occasional? You know, about every 12 hours or so.
*  No, I'd say I'd say on average, I probably average probably a glass a week.
*  But I tend to bundle that up.
*  So it might be I might not have anything for three weeks,
*  and then I might have three glasses of wine over an evening.
*  Yeah, my problem is once I have one glass, you're going.
*  Well, that's the problem, right?
*  Then your inhibitions are lowered and you're like, look, I'm home.
*  I'm not going anywhere.
*  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
*  What I do in order to not do that is.
*  I have my glass and then I don't let them fill it up
*  when it's only halfway, right?
*  If you're the restaurant or whatever, because then you it's sneaky.
*  Then you lose track of how much you've actually drinking.
*  You're having a good time. You just keep drinking.
*  So I make a decision, OK, I'm going to have fun tonight,
*  but I'm going to have two glasses or one glass, two glasses or three glasses.
*  Never more than that, because I'm going to it's just not worth the pain.
*  Yeah, that's the problem is you have that third glass.
*  You kind of lit after the third glass.
*  There'll be no stop. Then this four and five.
*  You're doing shots.
*  Is that dancing on the table
*  and having one fun, hell of a hell of a fun time,
*  but feeling terrible the next day.
*  Do you ever supplement with glutathione afterwards?
*  I never have tried during.
*  Yeah, it helps a lot with your liver,
*  your liver's ability to process alcohol.
*  It makes a big impact. Is that right?
*  Yeah. A doctor told me about it, if you believe it or not.
*  So doctors know some things.
*  Well, this doctor is very good.
*  Shout out to Dr. Gordon.
*  That's just a glutathione as an amino acid.
*  Yes. Yeah. It aids in your body's ability to process alcohol.
*  Does this give you the excuse you need to drink more?
*  No, but it does help.
*  It doesn't really. It's not a good enough excuse.
*  You're still doing a lot of damage, but right.
*  But it does help.
*  And another thing that helps with me is if I drink water and I sub electrolytes.
*  Yeah, I do that too. Such a big.
*  The problem is then you're going to get up to a car.
*  You're just going to pee pee pee.
*  But you got to deal with that.
*  You know, interesting thing I discovered about you today is that
*  your man has these very great passions about things that you were to fend these.
*  Absolutely. You know, we had I don't know if you can edit any of this,
*  but we argued probably for 30 minutes about
*  heart reversal with meat and plant based stuff.
*  And you're you're so passionate about.
*  You got to cut the crap out.
*  You got to cut the crap out.
*  And then and then you start saying, man, I just love pasta.
*  These uncle Eddie's cookies are so incredible.
*  It's like I find that fascinating.
*  You are you're and it but I also like that about you.
*  A you're not you're not a hypocrite.
*  I mean, you're not you're not you're not pretentious.
*  I'm not lying. You're not lying.
*  You're authentic. That's what I'm looking for.
*  You're authentic. You show the real Joe Rogan shows up.
*  And I so I like that about you because I like authentic people.
*  And then you're willing to say this isn't bad for me, but I choose to do it anyway.
*  In a sense, you're doing it consciously, then you're making a conscious
*  conscious trade off, although you say sometimes you lose control.
*  Then you go unconscious. Is that true?
*  Well, not that bad.
*  If I do eat pasta like legitimately, it's no more than once a week.
*  It's it's rare.
*  It's very rare that I sit down and eat a big.
*  The problem is once I'm eating, I'm like, fuck it, we're doing it.
*  Ah, and then I go.
*  But the majority of my diet is very healthy.
*  The vast majority of my diet, I mostly wild game.
*  Some I hunt. So I'm eating elk meat.
*  I'm eating. Are you getting those pigs?
*  I haven't here. I have in the past.
*  I've shot pigs in California,
*  but I've been invited to do it out here in Texas.
*  But unfortunately, a lot of people in Texas are not eating them.
*  They're shooting them and then leaving them there, which is
*  I'm not interested in that.
*  But I am interested in eating them. You eat what you kill. Yeah.
*  I eat. I used to have chickens when I lived in California.
*  But coyotes ate them all.
*  It's a rough, rough, rough couple of days in the house.
*  But then those eggs are fantastic.
*  And those are, you know, when you have free range chicken eggs
*  and they have that dark orange.
*  I have eggs. I mean, I have chickens.
*  Do you eat the eggs? I don't.
*  But I give them away.
*  I should have brought you some today.
*  Do you think they're bad for you?
*  The honest answer is I stopped eating eggs for a very bizarre reason,
*  which was that when I first became plant based, the media,
*  we got really interested in it.
*  And I said, well, do you are you pure?
*  And I said, no, I eat eggs from my own chickens.
*  So every time I was talking to the media, they always want to ask me
*  about the chickens and the eggs.
*  And I always had to explain it.
*  And I got so sick of explaining it.
*  And I said, you know what?
*  They're going to stop eating these damn eggs.
*  I don't ever have to answer this question again.
*  Really? Yeah, really.
*  I wish I was your friend back then.
*  I would said, John, fuck those people.
*  Eat those eggs.
*  It's like a zero karma situation.
*  You misunderstand.
*  It's it's not that I were scolding me.
*  I just was I was bored.
*  Oh, I was the question. Yeah, I understand.
*  And so once I just said, no, I don't eat any.
*  I just 100 percent. I get it.
*  But you can't alter what you're eating because you don't want to talk about it.
*  That seems crazy, especially chickens and eggs.
*  It's such a free ride.
*  It wasn't. You feed them.
*  They're healthy.
*  They you eat their eggs.
*  They're good for you.
*  We give them away. Our friends love it.
*  Well, that's nice.
*  But you don't do anything about frying when the bitches up when no one's around.
*  You know, I I I did the first couple of years and then I stopped doing it.
*  And I haven't had an egg since and I haven't missed it.
*  Bill Burr is a good buddy. Mine's a hilarious comedian.
*  He goes, he goes, you want to get fucking confused?
*  He goes, Google, are eggs good for you?
*  And then just start reading.
*  I know that's worse than his coffee. Good for you.
*  That's one of those things where you can find a hundred articles
*  that say eggs are the greatest food in the world and a hundred articles
*  that say eggs are going to kill you.
*  And it's like, you know, to go to the research.
*  You know, eggs are a paradox because eggs have a lot of
*  they have a lot of good things in them.
*  Yeah. That's why they show up is like they're really good for you.
*  They have a lot of nutrients in them.
*  But then they also have things that we don't think of as particularly good.
*  So that's why it's a paradox.
*  That's why you get opposite. Yeah.
*  Well, you also just get people that think they're 100 percent good for you
*  and people that think they're 100 percent bad for you. Right.
*  It's like he's just saying like and it's what we're talking about, essentially,
*  like the argument of plant based versus paleo, you know, versus now the carnivore,
*  which has been introduced.
*  I had a very compelling conversation with Paul Saladino for three hours
*  where he's talking about the benefits of a nose to tail carnivore diet, eating
*  nose to. Yeah.
*  Eating organs, organ meats and the importance of organ meat. And that
*  it's like it's pretty interesting.
*  Like a lot of people that eat that way are very healthy.
*  And then a lot of people that eat vegan are healthy.
*  It's like you could get lost in these conversations
*  and trying to figure out what's right and what's wrong.
*  In a lot of ways, you have to find out what's right for you. Yeah.
*  But you have to be kind of
*  objective about it, meaning you can't just fall into confirmation bias
*  because if you do that, it's like I've seen a lot of people say,
*  you know, it's so confusing.
*  You you Google or eggs good for you and you get such contradictory information.
*  So, you know, I'm just going to eat what I want. Yeah.
*  Then you're doomed.
*  Then you're just going to eat calorie dense foods that taste good for you.
*  And you're going to screw yourself up and get fat.
*  I think having cheat meals is not a bad move.
*  And that's what I basically do when I have big bowls of pasta
*  or sit down with a bag of cookies.
*  I don't think it's bad to reward yourself, but I think the majority
*  of what you consume should be it should taste good, but be good for you.
*  And I think that that's where people need to make their choices correctly.
*  I agree. I see it the same way.
*  I I you say cheat meal.
*  I think it is
*  just an occasional indulgence. Yeah.
*  Because because life is not meant to be purely ascetic.
*  It's meant to be joyous. Yes.
*  And we're going to die anyway.
*  So we should we should have some some joy in our lives.
*  But we'll have the most happiness and joy in life if we're also healthy.
*  So if we go too far in indulging ourselves,
*  we may be suboptimizing in the long run.
*  Now, when you say you're going to die anyway, when you see these crisper people
*  and all this crazy genetic manipulation, if they start
*  rolling out some new technology that extends life far into the future.
*  Like I've heard that if you can make it to 2050, you're basically going to live forever.
*  Yeah, that's Ray.
*  Ray Kurzweil has been making that.
*  Yeah. Singularity, right?
*  Yeah. He's 2045, right?
*  Yeah. If we get since we're extending the lifespan
*  a couple of years, a decade, and it's accelerating,
*  perhaps we'll get to a place where so the joke there.
*  Is when I get to be 100, I'll be able to live forever as I age, age 100.
*  Well, they don't think that, though, they think they're going to be able to reverse it.
*  The idea is that whatever is causing aging,
*  what's causing the deterioration and the quality of your life,
*  that that's all disease and that what's the disease that we've accepted.
*  We call it old age.
*  But really, what it is is a slow disease that everyone has.
*  And if they can get you back to your prime, wherever that would be.
*  Imagine if you could be a 25 year old man again, John.
*  Out there with with the wisdom I have.
*  Yes. Living your life because just out there free and happy. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So here's the thing.
*  There's another theory, a lot of theories, right?
*  A theory that I favor is, is that.
*  DNA made a deal a long, long time ago, or it was a decision was made,
*  maybe not consciously evolve this way.
*  It said DNA is immortal,
*  but the holder of the DNA is expendable.
*  And so DNA is immortal.
*  We're all DNA in the DNA.
*  We we we send that on.
*  The DNA is immortal.
*  The DNA is in every species.
*  Every life form has DNA in it.
*  DNA is what's driving it.
*  DNA is the immortal being.
*  And we're not.
*  And we're the DNA is programmed.
*  So they're basically saying we're going to reprogram the DNA. Maybe.
*  But every life form ages and dies and DNA doesn't.
*  DNA is immortal.
*  And I think that's the deal that was made.
*  Not I mean, that's just what DNA did.
*  It's like it's hard to keep these life forms alive, but I can keep
*  the the sex part of me alive and I can through sex, I can spread it.
*  And I DNA will continue to live.
*  That's what I think is going on.
*  I think that's an interesting way to look at it.
*  But I think as you said earlier, that the average age of people died at used
*  to be 30 or whatever it was.
*  And now due to our understanding of nutrition and science and medicine,
*  we've extended it all the way to 80 in the Western world. Right.
*  I feel like that's how we're going to look back at people who died at 80.
*  Like these poor fucks.
*  They didn't have genetic engineering.
*  They didn't understand that as you get older, you have a better understanding.
*  And maybe you can achieve enlightenment in your lifetime.
*  You can be free of all the bullshit that holds people back.
*  And yeah, I read I read a
*  a great science fiction series.
*  The first one was Spin by Robert Charles Wilson.
*  And in.
*  It's a long story because it has three novels based in it.
*  But the essence for what it relates to what we're talking about is
*  the people that we sent some people to Mars and they evolved over time
*  and they came back to the earth and they had developed certain Martian drugs
*  that would extend our lives about another 50 years.
*  And if you took the drugs and they were quickly made illegal.
*  So the whole black market for them.
*  And so they called it the thirds that the thirds,
*  because they'd had this other third to their life.
*  And the thing is, is that
*  humanity became a lot wiser because as we get older, we do tend to get.
*  I'm a lot wiser today at 67 than I was when I was 40.
*  A lot wiser at 40 than I was at 20.
*  So if my brain doesn't degenerate through Alzheimer's or dementia,
*  it seems reasonable to think I'll be wiser at 100 than I am at 67.
*  Yeah. And think if we were able to extend that into 120, 130.
*  A lot of these problems that we have wars and all this irrationality
*  would start to disappear because we just become older and wiser as a species.
*  That's what we would hope.
*  Or you have Donald Trump.
*  He's 74 years old.
*  He's not a young man.
*  And he doesn't seem I mean, he says the most ridiculous, preposterous shit.
*  He says shit that you would cringe at saying if you were 30. Right. Well,
*  here's what people live longer.
*  Trump may be wiser today at 74 than he was at 30.
*  Oh, that's a good point.
*  So we don't we'd have to have a comparison.
*  I'm sure he is. I'm sure he is.
*  Yeah. You'd have to compare him to his younger self.
*  That's the thing. Like maybe if you give morons enough time,
*  they eventually will get to a point where they're like 160.
*  They just sort of apologize and everybody. Maybe so.
*  I think I'm so sorry. I was so dumb. I didn't know.
*  But, you know, here's the thing about politics.
*  You can afford to have half the half the people hate you. I can't.
*  I can't have half my customers, half my team members boycotting whole. Right.
*  Do you know, Joe, back in 2007,
*  I wrote an op ed piece in the Wall Street Journal on whole foods as sort of
*  what we were doing for health care,
*  because at that time we didn't have Obamacare wasn't in place yet.
*  And President Obama had asked for suggestions.
*  So I just sent out what what Whole Foods was doing.
*  And the Wall Street Journal put an unfortunate title on that,
*  which is Whole Foods answer to to health care and to Obamacare,
*  something like that. And so it was just an op ed piece.
*  It's no big deal. It's just one guy's opinion. Right. Right.
*  So we had.
*  Hundreds of boycotts around the country of Whole Foods market.
*  There Facebook, there was a signature page and 350,000 people signed it.
*  So they were in a boycott Whole Foods market.
*  My board of directors got.
*  Thousands of letters, emails, text demanding that I be fired.
*  And then it set this whole I was in the tea party was going on.
*  So the tea party then was doing by cots and it was like, hello, everybody.
*  I just wrote an op ed piece. It was just an opinion piece. It's just my opinion.
*  I didn't even I didn't. But they attacked Whole Foods.
*  Yeah. So what I learned in the lesson, my scar on that one is
*  if I go out into the public and I express any kind of political opinion,
*  chances are now it's cancel culture.
*  Back then, they were just they were trying to cancel me back then, actually.
*  Yeah, it just wasn't a culture thing. It wasn't a cultural thing.
*  So I've learned to be a little more careful about voicing.
*  Someday when I retire from Whole Foods, I'm going to be unleashed.
*  When that happens, you got to come back.
*  Mackie on plus and get nutty. I'll help you launch a podcast. Why not?
*  I think that that's very unfortunate, you know, because I think
*  having an opinion about something is especially when a person has achieved
*  a level of success where they've seen a lot of things and they've had to navigate
*  a lot of things like that's that's those are the people that want to hear from.
*  Like, why is someone so upset about a person,
*  just a public person, your opinion about an issue that we're all dealing with?
*  I think it's because we talked about before earlier today that
*  some people identify their beliefs with who they are.
*  So when you express opinions that differ with their beliefs,
*  they experience it as a personal attack.
*  And that's why they get so upset and angry.
*  You and I don't do that.
*  You could be telling me that I think your plant based diet is full of shit, John.
*  And it's like, OK, well, you're entitled to your opinion.
*  And we'll have to compare notes here. But I didn't take it personally.
*  Well, that's evidence that we're still having fun.
*  As heated as things got.
*  Exactly, because we aren't our opinions.
*  You know, but we don't identify our opinions as as an essence of who we are.
*  But other people do.
*  So opinions are very frightening and threatening to them politically, too,
*  especially when politics are involved.
*  And I remember those days of the early days of the Obama administration.
*  People were so upset at him. All those Tea Party people.
*  You think we're going to have a civil war in this country, Joe?
*  I don't think we are.
*  But it's not outside of the realm of possibility.
*  It's not good.
*  It's the most polarizing.
*  I think I thought the Tea Party times were tough.
*  But Obama wound up being the successful president
*  and pulled us out of the 2008 crisis, even though there's a lot of disputes
*  whether or not he should have bailed out the the banks.
*  At the end of the day, things are going pretty well towards the end of his presidency.
*  You know, whether people liked him or didn't like him, this is a different animal.
*  This this the situation we have now where Trump is claiming that the
*  the election has been stolen and there's a large percentage of people
*  to think that's the truth.
*  And then there's other people that are like, you know, they voted for Biden
*  just because they hate Trump.
*  There's a lot of I mean, there's not a lot of people that are really excited.
*  Well, in this case, they're either going to be able to prove the claims or they're not.
*  Yeah. And doesn't look good.
*  There's not much time.
*  They're not much time to prove it. Yeah. So
*  I will have to see it unfold and how how what happens.
*  So I don't know. It's very bizarre.
*  It's it's the most bizarre political time of my life, or at least as an adult.
*  Yeah. What's as we were talking about earlier, it's this
*  this situation that they talked about in the social dilemma, this
*  same polarizing moment, but it's more accelerated now than I've ever felt it.
*  Do you do you feel like you're being manipulated by social media?
*  I'm just curious.
*  No, I don't listen.
*  Yeah, I don't either. Actually, I'm not on any social media.
*  I'm sure it's manipulating me in some way.
*  I'd be naive to say it doesn't.
*  It's got to have some sort of an effect on me.
*  You have your you tweet, though, right?
*  Yeah, but I do what I call post and ghost where I post and then I run away.
*  I don't read. So you don't you don't you don't get caught up in the hubbub.
*  No. And I very rarely tweet most of I post things on Instagram
*  and they're very nonpolitical.
*  Most of it is just interesting things.
*  You know what? You need to learn the lessons from your social media
*  and apply it to your pasta eating.
*  Ah, I kind of have because it sounds like you're very disciplined
*  in the social media realm.
*  You don't you it hasn't taken you over.
*  I'm relatively disciplined with my diet.
*  Relative. That's why I'm not a fatso, but I could be.
*  I think you're just working your ass off.
*  I do that, too. But I'm I have a real weakness.
*  I just don't let it get me most of the time.
*  But when it gets me, oh, my God, it's embarrassing.
*  I'm going to go a little deeper on that with you and ask you a question.
*  So is it something that you consciously decide, OK, tonight I'm going to eat pasta
*  or is it like you get a craving and you just do it?
*  Usually it's a craving. And usually it's when I'm tired.
*  When I'm tired, I have a like you said after stand up or.
*  Yeah, I have a late at night.
*  And if I'm writing, even if I'm home writing late at night
*  and I'm done at one o'clock in the morning, usually I'm like, just go to bed, stupid.
*  But sometimes I'm like, come on, let's eat.
*  Do the camera catch that glint in your eyes?
*  It's a real glint.
*  Oh, that's a. But again, I don't do it enough where I get fat.
*  But I do understand people that do.
*  I really do. Because it's like, you know, people think I'm disciplined.
*  I guess I'm kind of disciplined, kind of.
*  But more than that, I'm scared of not being disciplined.
*  So I work. I work.
*  There's a weird like the work gets done.
*  But it's not like there's this like unflappable work ethic that never gets breached.
*  No. So I have to I have to play tricks on myself to get the work done.
*  Actually, I mean, I.
*  I just think you're a man that has strong passions
*  and those passions carry you into life.
*  And when you're when you're when you're full of passion for whatever it is,
*  I think you're probably prodigious in terms of what you do.
*  But then you have these other periods of time where you're sort of,
*  you know, you're not caught up in the passions and you're just sort of treading
*  water, so to speak. Am I right?
*  It's it's it's the problem is that when I decide
*  that I'm going to do something, I know I'm not supposed to do like eat too much.
*  I don't decide it very often, but when I do, it's like it fucks with your self
*  esteem because you're like, God, I let myself do that.
*  Like, why did I do that?
*  So you know how you what you could do that wouldn't mess with your self esteem
*  is if you just make a conscious decision, I'm going to do this today.
*  That's what the rock does.
*  You ever go to the rocks Instagram?
*  No. His cheat days are legendary.
*  So he just he's conscious about it.
*  He. Oh, yeah. He lets the world is not sneaking.
*  Dude, he'll eat stacks of pancakes like he's an enormous man.
*  He's a big guy. I've met him. I have not. He's huge.
*  He's so big, he doesn't seem like a real person.
*  Like a cartoon character. How tall is he?
*  Oh, my God. He's at least six. Five. Wow.
*  You really imagine how tall is he?
*  Like officially six five ish, but he's enormous, like 300 pounds.
*  All muscle giant, just giant human.
*  You're around him. You're like, that's not a real person.
*  That's a that's a superhero.
*  Actually, I like I like I like to I like the rock and movies and stuff.
*  I like his personality.
*  He's a very inspirational person.
*  I like I like Schwarzenegger when he was doing his Terminator stuff
*  and those movies, I thought he was I thought he was a great comedic actor.
*  Yeah, that is really funny.
*  I don't think he intended to be comedic.
*  I just think that kind of became his schtick because he was naturally
*  sort of kind of funny.
*  Well, the rocks Instagram, at least once a week or so, he'll
*  he'll post like what he's doing, like he'll have like a tray of sushi
*  that's as big as this table.
*  And I'm not kidding.
*  It's just ridiculous amounts of food he consumes sushi.
*  You know, you can eat a lot of sushi.
*  Doesn't have that many calories in it.
*  Well, there you go. Let people know.
*  Or you can't eat 100 pounds of it.
*  I mean, he'll eat a plate as big as this table.
*  But I mean, stacks of pancakes and cookies.
*  Well, those are calorie drinks.
*  He goes off. But you go to that guy's social media
*  and he's in the gym every single day.
*  I mean, he's these go off days probably help fuel
*  his motivation and his discipline because he gives himself a little mental break.
*  Wow. That, you know, also that's fascinating.
*  It may be that he's doing that and that helps
*  because he feels a little bit guilty about it, perhaps.
*  He says, now I have to double my workout to make up for it.
*  So it's actually using it to push him.
*  I don't know. You know, that guy is so disciplined.
*  I doubt that's the case.
*  I think he really has a healthy attitude.
*  Like, I'm going to take a day and just go fucking crazy.
*  And then after that's over, it's back to the grind.
*  I just think he's on the grind literally every day.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  Did we just talk for like four hours? No way.
*  Yeah, we did. It's for that. It's 435.
*  Good. We got a lot of shit you can edit.
*  We're not editing and nothing.
*  Conscious capitalism, John Mackie and conscious leadership is also available.
*  The whole foods diet.
*  Get yourself some books.
*  Thank you, brother. I really appreciate it.
*  It was fun talking to you. Thanks.
*  And when you retire and you're ready to talk some shit, come back
*  and we'll have you go off.
*  All right. Thank you, John. Appreciate it.
*  Bye, everybody.
