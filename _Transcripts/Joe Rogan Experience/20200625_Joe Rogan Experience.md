# Joe Rogan Experience #1497 - Joe Schilling
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4me69rP0mPM)
*  Stitch him up!
*  What's up brother?
*  How you doing?
*  We're rolling.
*  Rolling.
*  So, I've been talking about you a lot lately.
*  I appreciate that.
*  First of all, you know I love you.
*  I love you too.
*  But it's also, your Instagram page has become a highlight of police brutality.
*  And I know you take a lot of shit for it, but I think it's very important, and we were
*  just talking about this.
*  I think it's important not just for the people, but I think it's important for the police.
*  I think it's important for police reform.
*  I think they need to see.
*  Like this is what happens when you have shitty people doing this very fucking difficult job
*  and you got a lot of them.
*  I think, you know, my thing was it just became, everybody just always says, well it's only
*  a few bad apples, a few bad apples, a few bad apples.
*  And I'm like, well I can just show you there's a lot of these bad apples, you know what I
*  mean?
*  And I think that, like you said, it's better for future police.
*  If they're so scared to do their job, it's because everyone hates them.
*  Because everybody hates them because they're constantly being dickheads to everybody.
*  That makes it worse for the good cops.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I do know what you mean.
*  I was talking about this the other day with Colleen Noir, and we were saying that it's
*  a job that is almost impossible to do for the average person.
*  You need to be like a fucking Navy SEAL.
*  You need to be like a person who's gone through some rigorous training and a person who really
*  understands how to defuse situations.
*  Need to be a person who knows how to keep your shit together, a person who knows how
*  to respect people.
*  They need a lot more training.
*  Jaco Willink was talking about that.
*  He said, I think they should have 20% training.
*  He goes, they train for like, you know, a couple of weeks.
*  It's like nine weeks or something.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it's over.
*  And then they're out there in the field.
*  He goes, I think 20% of their time should be spent training.
*  I don't mean to interrupt you, but maybe it's even worse than that, is it's not nine weeks
*  and then the field.
*  In LA County, you want to be a sheriff?
*  It's nine weeks or however long and if it's 10 weeks, I'm sorry, or 12 weeks.
*  It's not that many weeks.
*  Right out of the academy, you go straight to two years in the jail.
*  They're like, oh, all the human interaction you've had before you went to the academy,
*  now we're going to surround you by the worst examples of everybody for two years.
*  And then you're going to go on the streets and try to be normal.
*  You go to jails for two years?
*  Two year minimum.
*  What?
*  All sheriffs.
*  That's probably because they just need people in the jails, right?
*  Well, that goes back to what?
*  I mean, I feel like they...
*  There's a lot of shit going on there.
*  There's a lot of shit going on there.
*  First of all, there's private prisons.
*  Then there's drug laws.
*  Those are the two big ones.
*  You want to find out why the fucking prisons are filled up with people.
*  Those are two big ones right there.
*  How many people are in jail for shit they should never be in jail for?
*  Decisions that other people make with their own body that doesn't harm anybody other than themselves.
*  You could buy alcohol, but you can't buy coke.
*  You can't buy weed.
*  You can't buy...
*  Nonviolent drug offenses is a giant percentage of the population.
*  And then you said they go to jail for that because they made a mistake.
*  But then they don't just get out of jail and they're free.
*  They put you on probation and they put these extended five years probation,
*  anything's a probation violation.
*  And then they just keep you back into that same system, back into the same system, back to the same system.
*  You know, Father's Day, I was out back.
*  I did a post around my kids.
*  I'm really proud of my kids.
*  So I did a post on Father's Day and I was like, man, it's Father's Day.
*  I'm gonna chill, smoke a joint, fucking crack a beer.
*  It's like 10 o'clock in the morning.
*  I can do that on Father's Day, you know?
*  And I'm sitting there, I'm really enjoying it.
*  And I'm like, I'm gonna do a post for Ignite.
*  Shout out to Ignite.
*  And I'm like, it hit me like it's Father's Day.
*  How many fathers are in prison right now still to this day over something that I can do legally and post on the Instagram now?
*  It's insane.
*  Not only that.
*  It's insane.
*  In jail for something that's now an essential.
*  Like it's an essential thing that you can do during COVID.
*  Like when everything was locked down, you could still buy weed.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's crazy.
*  And then you can't just blindly turn your eyes to all this stuff.
*  No.
*  With everything going on in the world, it's like that's why I'm putting this stuff on my Instagram.
*  It needs to be seen.
*  Yeah, it's, I'm glad you're doing it.
*  Thank you.
*  And I know you take a lot of hate for it.
*  And that's one of the reasons why I highlighted it.
*  I want to shine people your way and let them know.
*  Like you're not doing this because you're a dickhead.
*  You're doing it because you're showing horrible shit.
*  There's a video that you show that I've watched so many times, man.
*  There's the cop that rear naked chokes that lady and throws her to the ground for no reason.
*  Horrendous.
*  No reason.
*  Horrendous.
*  And you would see him, some days I'm like, sometimes I don't have time.
*  I'm not even going to look at the comments because I don't want to go there.
*  But some days like today I got time.
*  I will battle these fucking assholes in the comments all day long.
*  They'll defend that.
*  Well, she shouldn't have resisted.
*  I want context.
*  Show me context.
*  Like if that was your mom.
*  What scenario or context are you looking for that that would be OK?
*  Or your lady.
*  To jump on her back or your daughter.
*  Yeah.
*  Or your daughter.
*  Or your grandma.
*  Yeah, Jesus Christ.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's nuts.
*  It's people that shouldn't be cops.
*  And it's too easy to be a cop.
*  It's too easy.
*  And they don't get paid enough.
*  And they don't get trained well enough.
*  And this defunding the police shit is the wrong way to handle it.
*  I know they think it's the right way to handle it.
*  Yeah, we're just, these cops are bad.
*  We just take away all the money.
*  Oh my god, you're going to create fucking chaos.
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't looked into the defunding thing a lot.
*  I've heard about it a lot.
*  But when you talk about defunding, let's talk about why do these cops need fucking tanks in downtown?
*  Why do these cops need all these AR-15s and full bullet?
*  Like what are we training for?
*  We're trying to scare people.
*  Why are we spending all of these tax dollars to scare people?
*  I'm going to show you some shit that John Joseph sent me.
*  My buddy John Joseph from the Cro-Mags.
*  He's, this shows that people who have different points of view could be good friends.
*  Because he's a good friend of mine.
*  He wrote a book called Meat is for Pussies.
*  So there you go, folks.
*  We can all get along.
*  We really can.
*  You fucking idiots.
*  Anyway, he sent me some shit.
*  His friend is, he's working homicide in Harlem.
*  And 21 people got shot the other day because nobody wants to be a cop there anymore.
*  So it's fucking madness.
*  Like he said, it is madness in New York City.
*  Like literally, god damn it, where can I find it?
*  Like nobody wants to do the fucking job.
*  He's like, it's crazy down there.
*  They didn't want to do the job before, or they don't want to do the job now that the
*  heat and the spotlight is on them.
*  Now everybody's resigning.
*  Well, if I can't do whatever I want and have absolute immunity, then I don't want the job
*  anymore.
*  You shouldn't have had the fucking job to begin with.
*  That's a good point, too.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like why did you have the job?
*  All right, look at this.
*  This is all the fucking people that got shot the other night as one day.
*  This is what's, that's what happens when there's no cops.
*  Well, there's no cops and no one's policing anything.
*  People just go ham.
*  I mean, that's what you saw in Santa Monica.
*  Santa Monica is as white as Wonder Bread, right?
*  It's crazy, yeah.
*  And it was crazy during the looting.
*  I mean, crazy.
*  The cops were told to stand down.
*  They were told to stand around and watch.
*  So the whole thing of, you know, hey, you need the cops.
*  When you call them, you need them.
*  When shit goes crazy, the cops are there for you.
*  Not that time.
*  The sheriff actually told them to not do anything.
*  So people were smashing windows and stealing things.
*  They're standing around.
*  And there's videos of this one guy running around the street
*  pointing guns at people, cars smashed into each other.
*  It's like a movie.
*  What was the point of telling them to stand down?
*  I think they thought that people were going
*  to burn all this anger out, the George Floyd anger,
*  and that somehow or another, like, let them do it
*  and then we'll clean up the mess.
*  It's just incompetent policing.
*  It's incompetent leadership.
*  So there's the person that made that choice to revolt for him?
*  Because everybody should probably vote for her.
*  These are the kind of decisions that need to be made.
*  And you have to ask yourself, why would they?
*  What was the purpose in telling them that?
*  Well, this is a liberal progressive perspective.
*  This is something that they've tried
*  in a bunch of different cities.
*  They also, de Blasio did the same thing in New York City.
*  Cops were literally told to stand down.
*  And the cops are standing there.
*  And they're doing nothing.
*  This fucking video, the videos from New York City
*  are the nuttiest, because people are filming them
*  from their apartments.
*  So they're looking down on the street.
*  Cars are running people over.
*  People are smashing into windows
*  and running in and stealing stuff.
*  All these kids just wanting free shit.
*  Nothing to do with black lives for the most part.
*  A lot of them are just opportunists looking for stealing.
*  And then also caught up in the chaos
*  of the smashing windows and stealing stuff.
*  And then the cops aren't doing anything and they're young.
*  And they've been out of work for three fucking months.
*  And everybody's broke.
*  It's just so many factors compounded together.
*  But Giuliani was actually on Fox News talking about
*  there's a particular political perspective
*  on how to deal with looting and riots
*  in these particular situations.
*  And the idea is to let it burn out.
*  Let these people burn it out of their system.
*  But that it doesn't work.
*  He's like, this is an outdated style of policing
*  that they figured out doesn't work in the 60s and 70s.
*  But there's a lot of progressive people
*  that are in positions of leadership
*  that still think it's a good idea.
*  That seems like a terrible idea.
*  Well, nobody knows really what the fuck to do
*  when everything goes haywire.
*  It's like theories.
*  Like what do you do?
*  Well, you better protect lives,
*  but don't worry about property
*  because everything's gone nuts.
*  And then the other perspective is
*  send in the fucking National Guard.
*  And everybody's like, don't do that.
*  That's the military.
*  So I don't know what the correct perspective is.
*  And thank God I'm not a fucking governor or mayor.
*  That's when you know things are fucked.
*  If someone like me ever gets to a position like that.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  Part of me thinks that the National Guard
*  would be service, off duty servicemen or however that works
*  that are from this city or from the area
*  would probably do a lot better job
*  and get more respect than the police
*  that are driving around shooting kids with pepper balls
*  and doing all this crazy shit we're seeing everywhere.
*  You would say that,
*  but one of the most egregious videos of police brutality
*  was the National Guard in Minnesota
*  where those girls were on their porch.
*  I don't know if you saw that one.
*  And these National Guard dickheads
*  are walking down the street like, get inside, get inside.
*  And they go light them up.
*  And they're shooting rubber bullets
*  at these fucking girls in their house.
*  They're on their porch.
*  These girls got hit.
*  It's insane.
*  And she's like, ow, fuck.
*  And she's like inside her house.
*  And then a bunch of people have lost eyes.
*  There's a bunch of people who lost eyes during this.
*  There's so many.
*  And everyone now, everyone's just tagging me in videos.
*  And it's overwhelming.
*  That kid that got shot in the face,
*  other one lost his eye.
*  Multiple people have lost their eye.
*  Journalists have lost their eyes.
*  The video I posted of that guy,
*  they're like all squared up.
*  He's like walking toward them talking shit or whatever.
*  He's like smoking a cigarette.
*  And they mace him in the face.
*  And he turns around like a fucking G,
*  like hits the cigarette, like what a dick.
*  Turns back and they shoot him in the face point blank
*  with like a, I think it's a tear gas canister to the face.
*  In the face, I saw it.
*  I mean it explodes in his face.
*  Yeah, who knows what happened to that guy.
*  But it's, yeah, that is not serving or protecting.
*  It's neither of those things.
*  On any level.
*  On any level.
*  And you know, I get it, man.
*  Look, there's a fucking video.
*  We wanna talk about the other perspective.
*  There's a video, go to Hector Lombard's Instagram.
*  There's a video.
*  I mean, this is where it gets really squirrely.
*  Because there's this dumb white guy
*  who's in the face of this black cop.
*  The black cop's not doing anything.
*  He's doing his job.
*  And this guy's calling him a bitch.
*  He's calling him all these terrible names.
*  He's inches from, this scrawny ass man bun wearing dick head
*  is in this cop's face like,
*  what happened to Black Lives Matter?
*  Like if this is Black Lives Matter, this is a black guy.
*  Like what are you doing?
*  He's not even doing anything, man.
*  He's standing there trying to keep the peace.
*  And you're fucking with him and inciting him.
*  It's people, man.
*  It's people.
*  People, there's a lot of us suck.
*  And in pressure situations, a lot of us suck.
*  And these cops that you're seeing
*  that are doing these horrible things,
*  they're just fucking people, man.
*  And if you give a person that insane power
*  to mace a guy in the face
*  and then shoot him in the head
*  with a fucking tear gas canister,
*  that guy's gotta be held accountable.
*  And you gotta make sure that never fucking happens again.
*  And that video should be used for training purposes.
*  But everybody else on that day,
*  they say that there's good cops.
*  Everybody else on that guy's team knows that guy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They know that guy.
*  You're in a locker room with all your buddies or whatever.
*  You know who cheats on his wife and who doesn't.
*  Like you know that guy.
*  You know that guy's a fucking asshole.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  But what do you do?
*  It's just like, I look at it.
*  They feel like they can't do anything
*  because those people protect them.
*  If they're in the middle of a fucking shootout,
*  they don't want to be the guy that doesn't get back up
*  because you ratted out the guy
*  that shot the guy with the tear canister.
*  Well if that's the problem that we're facing,
*  then it's time to clean house and start all over again.
*  And everybody needs to be,
*  you're all fired and then you can reapply for your job,
*  but you're getting reapplied for your job
*  from a completely different system
*  or a completely different interview process,
*  somebody that's not attached to you.
*  Because if that's the problem that you have
*  is now I can't trust,
*  these guys aren't going to trust me,
*  then what are we supposed to do?
*  Just say it's okay every time that happens?
*  Yeah, we shouldn't.
*  We definitely shouldn't say it's okay.
*  They need reform.
*  There's no question about it.
*  Anybody who says they don't need reform
*  needs to go to the Joe Schelling's Instagram page.
*  And for real, the other one, the old man,
*  that fucking old man that gets pushed down
*  and cracks his fucking head,
*  and then those guys in solidarity quit
*  and walk off the job.
*  And then when the guys get released
*  from whatever cops got charged or released from whatever,
*  all the other cops are outside, plauzing them.
*  Yeah, you can't push an old guy to the ground
*  and he cracks his head open and you walk away.
*  I don't know what that old guy said to them.
*  I mean, he was apparently an old hippie
*  that's been a peace activist forever.
*  And he's like 80-something years old or something like that.
*  He's a really old man.
*  Like when that, 70-something years old, do you remember?
*  75?
*  When he gets pushed, man, you can see he's feeble.
*  He falls, he has no control over his body,
*  and bangs his fucking head off the concrete.
*  And they just leave him there, man.
*  They just leave him there.
*  No one's doing CPR, no one's calling a medic,
*  no one's checking him, no one's holding his hand,
*  no one's doing a goddamn thing.
*  You're just watching assault.
*  You're watching assault on an old man.
*  On a helpless old man, or a helpless woman,
*  or a helpless 13-year-old girl you're slamming around.
*  Like it's all weak, weak, weak, weak, weak men
*  that are doing this.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  You know what I mean?
*  The ones that we give, I don't know,
*  it's like this lack of masculinity,
*  so we're like scared, so we give somebody else the power,
*  and you're giving weak-minded people guns and power.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You're giving people guns and power that,
*  the psychological ramifications of that job must be crazy.
*  If you're day in, day out, seeing gunshots,
*  and fucking suicides, and car accidents,
*  and stabbings, and rape, and all day long,
*  you're seeing the worst aspects of humanity,
*  that your mind gets fucked.
*  I've talked to a lot of cops that are good guys,
*  and they'll tell you, the job is hard, man.
*  There's days where you literally,
*  you think about taking your own life,
*  so you don't have to see anything anymore.
*  They say that.
*  I've heard that from cops.
*  And these are not cops that are abusive.
*  They're cops that are just like, man, I'm telling you,
*  it's like you get overwhelmed.
*  You can only walk up on so many suicides,
*  so many shotgun wounds to the face.
*  You can only walk up on so many of those,
*  and keep your sanity.
*  And the other thing that Jocko Willink was saying,
*  was that it's the same thing in the teams.
*  Psychologically, some people can handle anything.
*  And some people cannot handle anything.
*  Some people, just one or two things, and they're off tilt.
*  They just can't.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  But some people, they can go back home to their family,
*  and be a good dad, and be a good husband,
*  and be a good neighbor, and be a good person,
*  and just absorb it, and just go, well, it's horrible,
*  but hey, that's life.
*  That's tough.
*  Then that's another area that needs to be reformed,
*  is mental health with officers or whatever.
*  But we can't just ignore the whole thing and say, well,
*  it's a tough job.
*  No, we can't.
*  It's like the Chris Rock thing about you
*  can't be sometimes a good pilot.
*  You can't just crash into things.
*  You can't go without accountability.
*  Off topic, but that's how I feel about judges.
*  How many fights can you screw up before there's
*  an accountability there?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, no, that's a real good point.
*  Yeah, it's like basically every job.
*  It's just some jobs have much higher consequences.
*  And cops, it's like the highest.
*  It's one of the highest.
*  Cops, soldiers, the highest consequences of your mistakes.
*  Zero accountability.
*  Very little.
*  They only do, cops don't go to regular court.
*  They get internal investigations.
*  They all protect their own.
*  They protect each other.
*  They're on their own little team.
*  That woman, what is her name?
*  Breonna Taylor?
*  Is that her name?
*  The woman who got shot in her home.
*  And then no knock warrant, kicked down the wrong door,
*  shot through the window.
*  She was playing with her son or little brother
*  or somebody in the bed of a video game.
*  And then they charged her boyfriend, her husband,
*  with attempted murder for shooting back
*  at the person who's shooting through the window.
*  They didn't tell them they were cops.
*  Insane.
*  I mean, they have this guy cuffed in a fucking jumpsuit
*  going to jail.
*  It's crazy.
*  And the cop who did that only got fired.
*  That's it.
*  There was another one where the guy got killed.
*  And just now, just now got fired, by the way.
*  That happened quite a while ago.
*  The one I posted of the guy in the hotel
*  where they called the, he had a pellet gun
*  because he was like an out of town exterminator.
*  And he's with his girlfriend in a hotel room.
*  And they call the cops.
*  The cops come in.
*  They're like lined up down the hall with an AR-15,
*  screaming in ridiculous orders.
*  Yes, crawl.
*  Crawl over here.
*  Hands behind your back.
*  Crawl while you have, stretch your head in your temple.
*  But don't fucking move or I'll kill you.
*  Don't reach back.
*  The guy kept losing his pants because he
*  didn't have a belt on.
*  He's crying.
*  He's like, please, please.
*  And they just fucking gun him down while he's belly down.
*  So they already knew what they wanted to do.
*  And they're waiting for him to give the reason.
*  Well, exactly.
*  It's not hard to tell.
*  That guy is not a threat.
*  Just like it's not hard to tell that that woman,
*  the one where they throw the woman down and the cop jumps
*  on her back and puts her in a rear naked choke.
*  What do you do when you argue with your wife at home
*  or your sister or your girlfriend?
*  At what point does your, where do you
*  get the right to just jump to that conclusion
*  just because you're a cop?
*  That woman's not a threat to you.
*  No.
*  That old man that I posted yesterday,
*  they body slammed it.
*  You know, it's just so much shit.
*  I don't know if you saw the one where there's
*  a guy who got pulled over going five miles an hour
*  over the speed limit.
*  And the officer is threatened to pepper spray him
*  because he's filming.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  See that one?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of them, man.
*  There's a lot of them.
*  There's another one where it's a black guy
*  and he's just going on, like losing his shit on the cop.
*  And he's like, he's like, yeah.
*  So I just saw recently.
*  He's like, you pulled me over for not using my turn signal.
*  And you walked up to my window with a gun.
*  I have a gun pointed at me.
*  What the fuck is wrong with you?
*  I got kids.
*  I got a wife.
*  I want to live my life.
*  Why the fuck?
*  Because I made a turn signal?
*  Why are these guys so terrified to do their job?
*  Well, you don't know what it's like to work the streets
*  of South Side of Chicago.
*  There's people that live in South Side of Chicago.
*  There's people that grow up there.
*  There's people that are raised there.
*  There's old ladies that walk down the street there.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So don't tell me because you're too terrified to do your job.
*  It makes it OK for you to kill people.
*  Well, it's definitely not OK to behave like that
*  because they escalate way before it becomes a real thing.
*  And there's nothing going on.
*  You're pulling a guy over.
*  It's one thing if you're pulling a guy over and his windows
*  are all blacked out and he's not complying,
*  he's not rolling down his window.
*  You should get sketched out.
*  And he ran his tag and he has 15 armed robbery charges
*  or whatever.
*  Right.
*  But then there needs to be solutions.
*  All this complaining about it is great.
*  I really think what you're doing is very good.
*  And I think the cops should think it too.
*  They really should, man, because it
*  should highlight the need for reform
*  and highlight the need for education
*  and highlight the need for better training
*  and better funding.
*  You want better people?
*  You've got to pay them.
*  You can't have billboards up that say earn $50,000 a year.
*  Have a great gig.
*  You know, that's not the people you want, man.
*  You want it to be difficult to be a cop.
*  It sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke.
*  You need more training time to become a barber
*  than it is to become a cop.
*  That's a fact.
*  That's not a joke.
*  It sounds like a joke.
*  It's not a joke.
*  It's a fucking fact.
*  We give these people that have very little training
*  whatsoever and very little background
*  on their mental stability, you know a fucking weirdo
*  when you meet them, Joe?
*  You're like, oh, that guy's a little off.
*  You're not going to give that guy a fucking gun and a badge
*  and then the right to do whatever he wants.
*  And that's what we do.
*  And it keeps biting us in the ass all the time.
*  Yeah, I have a buddy of mine.
*  And he has this dude who was his trainer that
*  kept trying to be a cop.
*  The guy was fucking insane, fucking insane.
*  He would tell him in the middle of training,
*  Jesus doesn't want you doing that right now.
*  Jesus wants you doing something different.
*  And he'd be like, what?
*  He's like, Jesus wants you doing squats today.
*  Just got to trust in the Lord, man.
*  Today it's squats.
*  He's like, what the fuck are you saying?
*  He's like, he was wrong.
*  Something's off in his head.
*  And he just kept saying that, yeah, Long Beach turned me
*  down, so I'm going to try for the Pasadena Police Department.
*  This guy was mentally unstable, and he
*  kept trying to become a cop.
*  Now, if one police department was light on people,
*  and they needed that guy, and they gave that guy a gun,
*  and let that guy pull people over,
*  and Jesus tells them to shoot somebody.
*  Florida's saying that they would take on the police
*  department of Florida, we would take all the police
*  officers at the other state, they got in trouble
*  or whatever.
*  Whatever the fucking thing was.
*  Atlanta's all the police officers are not responding.
*  There's people that applied to be in the military
*  and didn't pass the thing, but still became cops.
*  It takes you a lower standard to be a police officer in the US
*  than it is to be a soldier in the US.
*  That's crazy.
*  What are we doing?
*  And what is the, you know, we have the same process
*  when I was in high school.
*  The guys come around in their suits.
*  If you take the ASBAP tests on, we can show you the world.
*  You'll get a free education, all that shit.
*  You don't qualify for them, but I could still get a badge
*  and a gun, and people are going to respect me.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  There's a lot of that shit going on.
*  That's real.
*  You know what I mean?
*  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
*  And it's just a poor management.
*  It's a poor management decision to run the police departments
*  that way, to have them that underfunded,
*  to have them that poorly represented.
*  Because I know there's good cops out there.
*  I've met them.
*  I know good guys that are cops.
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  Me too.
*  I've trained cops.
*  I've trained good cops.
*  I'm like, oh, that seems like a good guy.
*  And then I've seen him at other cops,
*  and I'm like, that dude is not all there.
*  That dude's not all there.
*  And he's still a cop.
*  Everybody in the fucking precinct knows all that's Dewey.
*  Don't worry about Dewey.
*  He's a good guy.
*  Yeah, just don't get pulled over by him.
*  Just don't get pulled over by him.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We're in a crisis in this country in many ways.
*  And Jaco was talking about this, that it's a leadership crisis.
*  It's all from the top down.
*  And it's a leadership when it comes to the president,
*  leadership crisis, governors, mayors, sheriffs,
*  and then the cops themselves.
*  It's a bunch of people that really don't have the character
*  to be doing that.
*  And look, I wouldn't wish it on anybody, man.
*  That's a tough fucking gig.
*  All those gigs we just said, being a governor,
*  fucking insanely hard.
*  I couldn't imagine being responsible for the economy
*  of a whole state, especially in California.
*  That's why our goofy governor keeps calling it a nation state.
*  It might as well be a fucking nation.
*  There's 40 million people in this motherfucker.
*  That's a lot of people, man.
*  That's crazy.
*  I don't want that job.
*  But if you're going to have that job,
*  you better be fucking really good, man.
*  You better be really good.
*  I think that we need four-year terms for everybody
*  of major powers like this so that we don't end up
*  with these career politicians and career.
*  This just stays the same.
*  And you build your relationships,
*  and the shit just stays the same.
*  There's no accountability.
*  There's no fresh blood coming in.
*  Maybe that's a good key for cops, too.
*  Have a four-year term, and then you're up for review.
*  Or the police chief.
*  You know how the police chief, I can only imagine it.
*  That's where I like, like, loot the weapon or whatever.
*  Martin and Riggs walk in or whatever.
*  And he's like, oh, you know, the commissioner,
*  Commissioner Gordon's breathing down my neck.
*  You got to stop choking all these guys out.
*  And they're like, you know, I don't give a fuck.
*  But you know, the commissioner's down my back.
*  He's not saying, hey, motherfucker, you're fired.
*  I'm going to press charges on your fucking ass.
*  This is how we do things.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But then there's always the romantic crazy cop.
*  Like Riggs in Lethal Weapon was the romantic crazy cop.
*  It was kind of cool.
*  He's a little unhinged, but he gets the job done.
*  Yeah, right.
*  You know?
*  But those guys are never abusive in those movies.
*  The unhinged guys, they're always heroes.
*  Yeah, they're always heroes and cool with people.
*  But they just eat cold pizza in the morning in a blender,
*  and they fucking smoke cigarettes,
*  and then they choke people.
*  So my son Jackson was scared of the police
*  before I was ever into any of it or said doing.
*  When I noticed it, I was aware of it.
*  I took a step back and looked at myself.
*  He's getting this from me, and he wasn't.
*  He was like three or four years old.
*  And I remember one day we pulled in to a bank,
*  and I parked between two cop cars.
*  And my older son gets out the car, and I'm like,
*  where's Jackson?
*  He's still in the back.
*  And he's all tense in the back seat.
*  I'm like, what's wrong with you?
*  And he's like, he wouldn't say anything.
*  My older son's like, oh, he's scared of the cops.
*  I'm like, why?
*  Because all he sees is cops come when you're in trouble.
*  Cops take you to jail.
*  Cops do bad things.
*  There's no like, when I was a kid in Bellbrook, Ohio,
*  where I grew up, we had a cat, and it used
*  to always go up in the tree.
*  And my mom would call the police in the fire department
*  any time the cat went in the fucking tree.
*  That's old school Ohio shit.
*  We'd try.
*  I couldn't climb a tree that high.
*  Get down, you're going to fall.
*  And then she'd call the fucking police in the fire department.
*  And they'd come, and they'd be cool.
*  And that fucking cop would give us crap or crackerjacks.
*  And when a cop drove by, he waved at you.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's small town life.
*  Well, that was like how shit should be.
*  Now, it's like, if I'm at fucking Quiznos,
*  and I'm like, oh, man, excuse me, officer, what time is it?
*  I'm on my fucking lunch break.
*  They're just fucking dickheads all the time.
*  They pull you over.
*  What are you doing speeding into my town?
*  It's just like this overwhelming fuck you all the time.
*  I got cop stories.
*  I got cop stories.
*  I know you do.
*  I got a few cop stories.
*  There's a lot of cop stories to have, good and bad.
*  But you only hear the bad ones.
*  There's a lot of interactions every day
*  that people have with cops that are positive.
*  I'm sure.
*  But it's just exactly like the Chris Rock joke.
*  You really can't have bad apples when it's that job.
*  No.
*  Just like you can't have bad fire department people.
*  You can't have bad pilots.
*  It's just a job you got to do right.
*  And then it's like for how long?
*  That's why lately I've been posting videos
*  from like three years ago, four years ago.
*  Same type of shit.
*  This is an old video, and nothing's changed.
*  Rodney King wasn't that long ago.
*  There was another one that just came out.
*  This guy's handcuffed on his back,
*  and they're beating him with tons, telling him
*  to put his legs down while they're
*  beating the shit out of him.
*  And then the guy that fell asleep in a Wendy's parking lot,
*  cop pulls him over.
*  He's like, hey, what are you doing?
*  The guy's like, look, man, I was fighting with my wife.
*  Fucking had been drinking.
*  Yes, sir, I've been drinking.
*  He hadn't been driving that they could prove yet.
*  So he's like, well, can you take his breathalyzer?
*  He's like, well, you know I'm already been drinking.
*  He's like, it's just part of my investigation.
*  It's no big deal.
*  The reality was they needed him to take the breathalyzer
*  because then they could arrest him.
*  Because they couldn't see him actually drive.
*  They couldn't do that.
*  So they tricked him into doing that.
*  Then they arrest him.
*  When they arrest him, he's got his hands behind his back.
*  Maybe he's tussling or whatever.
*  Nobody wants to get arrested.
*  While they're tasing him in the back multiple times.
*  These idiots give up the tazer.
*  So he's running away with the tazer
*  and they shoot him in the back.
*  Yeah, we were talking about that one.
*  He turned, didn't he turn and point the tazer at him?
*  Or is that what they said?
*  On the video it looks like he could've do whatever.
*  Invest, I can't keep up with the investigations
*  of like what day things are being found.
*  Maybe there was a shot left in it.
*  That's why there was a pop herd or there was, I don't know.
*  So there might have been a shot left in it.
*  People are saying that?
*  Yeah, and that's why I don't know.
*  But either way.
*  But if I tase you in the back four times,
*  it doesn't give you the right to kill me.
*  But if I shoot or aim one in your general direction,
*  it's ice this motherfucker.
*  And it wasn't like that guy was,
*  you had a conversation with him.
*  He just said he would go home.
*  His daughters were at his sister's house.
*  They'll just leave the car here and go.
*  They already had the agenda of what they wanted to do.
*  Why shouldn't that guy just, you know what, go home.
*  Mark Lamont Hill had a really important point.
*  He said, why is that a case even for the police?
*  There should be something else,
*  like some other division that just handles
*  nonviolent people that are just in need of assistance.
*  If you got a guy who's drunk in a parking lot,
*  there should just be some people that,
*  if you want to cite him and give him some sort of a fine
*  or suspend his license for 30 days or something like that,
*  something nonviolent,
*  but that guy should just get a ride home.
*  And if he says that he drove there,
*  well, hey man, you can't drive drunk.
*  You're in trouble for that.
*  But to try to tase him and all that other shit,
*  there's no need for that.
*  See, I'm torn on that is that, yes, you're absolutely right.
*  Somebody should be able to see that.
*  I just don't think that it's out of the realm
*  of possibilities that the police could be called
*  to that scene and not end up shooting the guy.
*  They should have the same wherewithal
*  that you and I are having in this conversation
*  to be like, oh, dude, what are you doing?
*  Your wife's probably pissed your dumb drunk right now.
*  And that's one of the ones where
*  the Atlanta Police Department is all walking off
*  in solidarity because the guy was charged
*  with felony murder.
*  And so they all quit.
*  Yeah, a lot of them are just not responding to things.
*  They basically don't feel like they're supported
*  and they want to let people know,
*  like this is what we do, this is how hard this job is.
*  So this is what it's like when cops don't respond.
*  That is the most idiotic baby little child shit to do.
*  I can't even get behind that at all.
*  Well, if you, I'm taking my ball and I'm going home then.
*  If you don't want me here, then I'm leaving.
*  I don't even know.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  It's not gonna change the charges.
*  If they charge him with felony murder,
*  they're not gonna uncharge him with felony murder
*  because the cops aren't responding.
*  And once it's like.
*  It just shows that once they don't care
*  about their community, they don't care about their oath,
*  they don't care about protecting and serving for you.
*  They care about staying together.
*  That's what we were saying earlier.
*  That's the oath, right?
*  That's the code of silence.
*  You have to protect those other people
*  because the shit could go down.
*  You need them to have your back.
*  I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying that is
*  how it works in the police department.
*  That's terrible.
*  Did you ever see the documentary, The 7-5?
*  I didn't.
*  You should see it.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  It's The 7-5.
*  The 7-5.
*  It is all about this guy, this guy Mike Dowd,
*  who's out now, who became a corrupt police officer.
*  Just joined the force because he wanted to be a cop.
*  And then right away was introduced to the fact
*  that this whole fucking thing is bad.
*  It's all corrupt.
*  They're all bad cops.
*  They're all doing fucked up shit.
*  I'm pretty sure they pushed a guy out of a window.
*  Like one of the first days that he got there,
*  someone got killed.
*  And they would just say, this is how it works.
*  And then cut to many years later,
*  he's robbing drug dealers and selling drugs
*  and they're organizing hits on people.
*  It's a crazy fucking movie.
*  From his words and his former partner's words,
*  and it just details how everything
*  went completely sideways.
*  And it just shows you, imagine if you were one of those guys
*  and that's your job, you're a fucking cop,
*  and you're in this precinct with all these other
*  corrupt cops and you're like, well this is what we do?
*  So this is what we do, we're just corrupt.
*  Fuck.
*  It's like the mob mentality with the protest, right?
*  You get a good protest or people protesting a real thing,
*  people that are having a peaceful march doing that stuff.
*  And then you compound, they have been locked in their house
*  for two months, everybody's broke,
*  they're losing their businesses, shit's getting fucking weird,
*  they're just going crazy.
*  But they're doing the protest.
*  Now you have some asshole come up with a hammer
*  and break a bunch of windows and start creating the drama.
*  It causes a mob mentality, right?
*  It's like people are smart but mobs are stupid, right?
*  Person is smart, people are stupid.
*  That same thing happened with the cops, right?
*  You're on a team, one guy starts doing shit,
*  bro, just shoot him in the face with a bean bag.
*  Nobody else see it, oh you fucking got him,
*  right on, pass me the gun, boom,
*  and they're all doing the same shit.
*  There's definitely a lot of that.
*  And then they're protecting themselves.
*  Yeah, there's definitely a lot of that.
*  Also there was some crazy shit where it was
*  pretty much proven that some cops were the ones
*  who were breaking windows in Minneapolis.
*  Oh yeah, there was one in New York where they were
*  sawing the roll up door open on a jewelry store.
*  A cop was doing it?
*  I'll find the video for you.
*  Oh, please find that video.
*  There's cops with like a fucking one of the,
*  I don't know, it's like a miter saw or whatever,
*  cutting the roll up door on the jewelry shop.
*  I think I saw that one.
*  It was, if I remember, it might be incorrect,
*  there was people, they got a call,
*  there was people trapped in there,
*  and they had to get them out.
*  They might have been robbing it or something like that,
*  but they had to.
*  Maybe.
*  They get trapped in there robbing it?
*  Yeah, I may be mistaken on that one,
*  but I think I saw it.
*  Oh, that's interesting.
*  Jamie with the fact check.
*  That seems like a weird way to save people,
*  saw the fucking security door open.
*  They broke it open in a bad way and snuck in,
*  and they had to get all their equipment and shit,
*  so they used the metal saw thing.
*  Hello 911?
*  Yeah, well, okay.
*  We were robbing this jewelry store.
*  That seems like the type of thing that you would say
*  when you were caught on camera robbing the jewelry store.
*  Well, actually, there was somebody inside,
*  I was trying to get them out.
*  It was this weird thing that happens sometimes,
*  being a cop.
*  That's true too.
*  How many cops robbed things during all the melee?
*  Had to be a lot, right?
*  Come on.
*  They had to.
*  The one that I saw was a Target in Minneapolis
*  where this cop that actually got recognized
*  and he got identified,
*  and this cop was smashing windows.
*  And these kids were like,
*  hey man, are you a fucking cop?
*  He's like, fuck off, I'll kick your ass.
*  And he's a big guy too.
*  Oh, that was a guy in Minneapolis with the thing?
*  Full face shield on and everything.
*  And they were like, this guy's wearing police issue shoes,
*  police issue clothes.
*  So let's look at that.
*  Why would they do that?
*  Why would a cop do that?
*  Because the cop wanted to break shit?
*  Or is there a plan to get fucking drama started
*  in a certain city and then that police station
*  just happens to burn down and they give it up too?
*  Well, I think in a lot of those situations.
*  How many records got destroyed
*  when they burned down that police station?
*  Oh, that's a good point.
*  Ooh, look at Joe Schilling's thinking on multiple levels.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think what happens with a lot of this,
*  it's called an agent provocateur, right?
*  And what they've used those people for before
*  is to stop a peaceful protest.
*  And the way they stop a peaceful protest,
*  they turn it violent.
*  And then they have the authorization to go in
*  and break up the protest and arrest people.
*  And that has been done.
*  That absolutely has been done.
*  That was done with the World Trade Organization protests
*  in the early 2000s.
*  They did that in Seattle.
*  That shit has been done.
*  They do it, it might be late 90s.
*  But they fucking do that.
*  That is a government tactic.
*  And say you have a good protest
*  and it has a good meaning and a good thing,
*  and that's bad for you if you're the government.
*  You're trying to be like, I don't really like this shit.
*  What do we do here?
*  Well, let's get some fucking assholes
*  to go in there and start some shit.
*  We haven't let these people leave their house in two months.
*  They're gonna do some dumb shit, right?
*  So we'll just start bashing up shit.
*  You know what, let's plant some fucking bricks.
*  Maybe we put some bricks on the street
*  where all these people are gonna come.
*  They're gonna fuck all this shit up.
*  Yeah, the brick thing was weird.
*  In some circumstances, the bricks actually were there
*  because of construction.
*  That's been proven.
*  There was one that was a synagogue in North Hollywood
*  and there was these bricks set up
*  right in front of the synagogue.
*  We're like, this is fucked up.
*  What is this about?
*  Turned out even worse.
*  The bricks had actually been there for a long time
*  and they were there to keep people
*  from driving into the synagogue.
*  They were to stop a car from smashing
*  through the front windows and killing people.
*  So they were worried after the Pittsburgh mass shooting
*  and a couple other mass shootings.
*  They were worried about their synagogue
*  so they set up these bricks to keep some fucking psycho
*  from driving a car through the building.
*  Which is, I mean, almost worse.
*  Almost rather than.
*  We have that everywhere though, right?
*  We have that in Sunset Boulevard or wherever.
*  There'll be concrete posts.
*  That's a normal thing, I think.
*  I guess, but this is weird.
*  I saw one of their bricks.
*  Because it was set up by these folks
*  that ran the synagogue and they fenced in.
*  Because the city didn't even protect it
*  if they had to do it themselves.
*  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
*  I mean, I think the city probably approved it.
*  But it's a weird, see if you can find.
*  I saw the picture, they're in like cages, right?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's a good thing you can buy at Home Depot, I guess.
*  Oh, you can?
*  For that reason?
*  In case you run a synagogue that's being targeted
*  by white supremacists.
*  Maybe the city's not got your back.
*  You're not worried about the cops showing up?
*  We're gonna put these rock piles in front of your shit.
*  It's just, this whole COVID and then the George Floyd
*  protests and then the riots and the looting
*  and everything like that really highlights
*  how fragile our civilization is.
*  Really, really shows everybody.
*  Yeah, and how easily we are controlled through the media.
*  Easily we're controlled.
*  I try not to watch anymore,
*  because you're just getting brainwashed.
*  And once you realize you're just being brainwashed,
*  they just control how you feel about everything.
*  You hate this guy, change the other channel.
*  No, that guy's a good guy.
*  This guy's, fuck this guy.
*  And it's just all misinformation.
*  The who and Fauci, one day, don't do masks.
*  You don't need masks.
*  The next day, you need masks.
*  Cuomo needs 50,000 respirator ventilators
*  and then puts them all in the nursing homes
*  and all the nurse people die.
*  But let's not talk about that.
*  Yeah, that's the Cuomo nursing home thing
*  is a giant scandal, man.
*  He let those people go back to the nursing homes
*  and they infected and killed thousands of people
*  because of that.
*  And so his numbers go straight up.
*  And then why are we incentivizing,
*  if we're even going to the,
*  why are we incentivizing hospitals
*  to say that there were COVID deaths?
*  What is the purpose of that?
*  It makes no sense.
*  I think the idea was because this was a new disease
*  and they required more,
*  financially it's more difficult to treat those people,
*  that they allocated more money
*  towards people that had COVID.
*  But when you do that,
*  you do incentivize people to mark deaths as COVID.
*  Yeah, there's people that get shot
*  and they were like, well, he had COVID when he died.
*  But did they test him for COVID?
*  Well, it doesn't matter, just write it on there.
*  But there are also-
*  And then the numbers come out.
*  Apparently, there've also been a bunch of people
*  that died and weren't COVID tested
*  that they do believe died
*  because of complications for COVID too.
*  So the idea is that it could even possibly balance it out.
*  They don't know.
*  But there are a lot of people that have,
*  here's a deceptive one that I've read.
*  It was really fucked up.
*  They were talking about this kid
*  who was, I think he was 17, who died from COVID.
*  And they said he was,
*  they said he was healthy.
*  No other health issues, they said.
*  But then you read the article deeper,
*  it turns out he had diabetes.
*  He had type 1 diabetes and he was 400 pounds.
*  And it's like, wait a minute, that's not no issues.
*  These articles are full of shit.
*  And they write those articles just so that you click on them
*  because they get the fucking ad revenue from clicks.
*  So they're incentivized to trick you into being scared.
*  You're like, oh my God, a 17-year-old died?
*  My 17-year-old can die, holy fuck.
*  And then you click on it.
*  And if you don't read six, seven paragraphs
*  into the article, you don't find out
*  that this was a 400 pound diabetic kid that has-
*  Could have died from the flu three months earlier
*  and it would have been the same shit.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  So the numbers are fudged.
*  So I don't want to believe your numbers.
*  Don't come to me with more scared tactics
*  about like, the numbers are spiking.
*  Well, you already said that 50% of the positives
*  are false positives.
*  Well, at least finally they're saying,
*  when they say that the numbers are spiking,
*  I haven't heard that 50% are false positives.
*  I haven't heard that.
*  I got a video that was the chick
*  that is with Fauci, the other one.
*  She was saying 50%?
*  Yeah, I don't know how old the video was.
*  But she had that our testing is coming up
*  and if you have 1% of whatever and we test it,
*  and 50, you know, about half of the positives
*  are false positive.
*  Jesus.
*  And then don't wear masks and you have to wear masks.
*  And they said the whole reason we have to flatten the curve
*  is because it can live on anything for up to like nine days
*  and even an asymptomatic person can still transmit it.
*  Then it comes out, they say the exact opposite.
*  Yeah, now they're saying asymptomatic people
*  very, very rarely transmit it.
*  I don't choose to believe that, Joe.
*  I'm gonna believe what they told me the first time.
*  There's a lot of people who do say that.
*  Not the new facts that they have now.
*  So we're still gonna wear masks all the time.
*  Yeah, people get mad at you if you suggest differently.
*  There's a lot of people that like being scared too.
*  And they're like, fuck you.
*  Love it.
*  Wear your goddamn mask.
*  Love it.
*  We need to protect people.
*  Love it.
*  But meanwhile.
*  Well, if there's no police,
*  who's gonna protect you and you?
*  Who's gonna protect your family?
*  Me.
*  Meanwhile, there was no,
*  these people weren't freaking out
*  when you're seeing these mass protests.
*  And the spikes, guess what,
*  happened right after the protest.
*  And at least they're saying that now.
*  They're being forced into saying
*  it's probably connected to the protests.
*  Well, of course.
*  Or it's just one more way to get people to,
*  let's scare them to stop revolting.
*  Let's get them to chill out.
*  Now the numbers are spiking, guys.
*  Do you think it's that calculated
*  that that's what they're doing?
*  I think there's a lot of calculated shit going on.
*  There's too many weird things going on.
*  I'm like.
*  Who's calculating it, though?
*  I think that it's Dr. Evil.
*  I think it is.
*  He's alive.
*  And like they're thinking,
*  next we're gonna launch the sharks
*  with laser beams on their head.
*  What happened to murder hornets?
*  They came and went real quick.
*  I was really worried about them.
*  Aliens, bro. Fuck.
*  I'm putting it out there.
*  The aliens? Aliens will come.
*  Well. Aliens are coming
*  before the election.
*  The alien thing is interesting
*  because there's quite a few real legitimate studies,
*  including black ops studies,
*  that are going on right now on aliens.
*  Particularly after the David Fravor incident,
*  which was an Air Force incident
*  that was off the coast of San Diego,
*  that was all documented
*  in terms of the speed of the aircraft,
*  the fact that they were tracking it,
*  the fact that it blocked their tracking systems.
*  So it was an active object
*  blocking their tracking systems.
*  And it also went from something like
*  right above the surface of the water
*  to 60,000 feet in a matter of a second.
*  Like whatever the fuck that thing is,
*  violates all laws of propulsion.
*  And all those Air Force guys were saying,
*  yeah, we've been following these things.
*  They've been down here for the last few weeks.
*  Like every now and then we'll see one
*  and they'll hover above the water
*  and dunk down into the water.
*  They don't know what the fuck they were.
*  And this David Fravor guy,
*  who's like a rock solid button down military man.
*  He is not a bullshit artist.
*  He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention.
*  He came on the podcast
*  and relayed his experiences with this thing.
*  And there's not just one of them
*  and they behave very similarly.
*  They've had them on the East Coast.
*  I'm doing a terrible job of giving all the facts
*  about how they operate and how they move,
*  but they defy all the known laws of propulsion.
*  They have no idea what they are.
*  They have no idea where they're coming from.
*  They don't know what they're doing.
*  But these things behave in some really
*  almost supernatural way in terms of like
*  what we know about physics.
*  And this is like unclassified now or this is recent?
*  Well, the government's come out and said,
*  I mean, they've openly said there's a real issue.
*  Trump says he's heard very interesting things
*  about Roswell, side of an alleged UFO event.
*  President was asked by his own.
*  Yeah, that was nonsense though.
*  Did you see that interview?
*  First of all, the whole interview was weird.
*  Like Donald Trump Jr. is interviewing Donald Trump
*  and he's not even doing it like he's his dad.
*  You know, like if I was sitting there with my dad,
*  I'd be like, all right, dude, tell me what's up.
*  What's going on with the aliens, pops?
*  What's going on with the aliens?
*  What you got back there, dude?
*  And also, I would ask that question four fucking years ago,
*  day one, I'd be like, come on, dude, aliens.
*  As soon as you walked me in, let's talk aliens.
*  I would run for president just to find out.
*  Just to win and find. I think you should run
*  for president, Joe. Fuck that, dude.
*  You should absolutely run for president.
*  Listen, I could cancel for all Joey Diaz conversations.
*  You could do like the presidential addresses
*  and just do a standup the whole time, every time.
*  That would, it would have to be that.
*  It would have to be like some seriousness and some,
*  like some, but you know, life is so preposterous.
*  And it's more preposterous now than it's ever been before.
*  It's nuts.
*  And meanwhile, there's no standup.
*  The only person doing standup right now has been,
*  there's a few guys that just started doing shows.
*  I'm actually in Houston this weekend for the first time
*  in three months, I haven't done any standup.
*  Chappelle's doing regular shows in Ohio.
*  Really?
*  He's got a outside wedding, like a pavilion.
*  And he's got it set up where everybody's socially distanced.
*  They all wear masks in the crowd.
*  They have Chappelle masks.
*  So they'll have like the C on their mask.
*  They're in the crowd.
*  And it's, my buddy Donnell did it and he said he loves it.
*  And Dave's like, listen, man, I gotta do something.
*  I gotta figure this out.
*  It's all been approved by the governor.
*  Everybody's distanced six feet apart.
*  They all maintain social distancing during the show.
*  They wear masks during the show.
*  How long are we gonna keep doing this?
*  Texas governor urges people to stay home
*  as states report surges of new COVID-19 cases.
*  Yeah, you wanna see the photo of the Austin protest?
*  You seen it?
*  It's crazy.
*  Austin, which is the most progressive city in Texas
*  had this insane protest, which listen, I think is great.
*  I do.
*  I think it's great that people wanna show solidarity,
*  that people want to get out there
*  and let everybody know that they're not down
*  with police brutality and that they're down
*  with racial equality and that you got all these thousands
*  and thousands of people together
*  to have the same positive message.
*  I love it.
*  However, that COVID doesn't give a fuck
*  about racial equality or social justice.
*  If you're not healthy, it's gonna get ya.
*  I don't know.
*  And the cases spike.
*  But the other thing about Texas is a giant percentage of it,
*  I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 50%
*  is actually in prisons.
*  So when they're talking about statewide issues.
*  Do you have an image?
*  Cause I can get an image for you.
*  I got a good one for you.
*  Oh, that's a good one.
*  Yeah, that'll cause a problem.
*  Look at all those fucking people.
*  But one thing they have found out,
*  if you guys are gonna protest,
*  protest during the day, and this is why.
*  There's been a new study that came out
*  that said that COVID-19 dies almost instantly
*  in contact with sunlight.
*  Didn't Trump say that like two months ago?
*  And everyone said he was crazy?
*  No, he was saying like put light into the body.
*  No, he said 80 degrees.
*  He said when the summer comes, the heat kills it.
*  But it's not the heat.
*  It's actually light.
*  So the nighttime is just as dangerous in the summer
*  as it is during the day.
*  It's not heat, it's not a temperature issue.
*  I'm sure some temperature kills it.
*  Joe, this thing is not real, bro.
*  No!
*  This is not real, bro.
*  It's not real.
*  Should we split a joint?
*  It is the fucking flu.
*  Yeah, please, let's do it.
*  Deep.
*  It's not real.
*  You don't think it's real?
*  I think that the flu is real.
*  I think that people get sick from the flu every year and die.
*  I think that it's a bad thing.
*  I don't think that all of this nonsense is going on,
*  and they keep, keep perpetuating it,
*  and keep perpetuating it, and keep perpetuating it.
*  Come on.
*  I'm just not buying it anyway.
*  I just, you guys, you change your views,
*  you change your opinions.
*  It's like, it's like if you were the writer of a TV show,
*  say Friends, your job would be to write a 30 minute episode
*  that was funny, and intriguing, and dramatic,
*  and fucking scary, or whatever the fuck.
*  And like, the media just writes an episode,
*  and then the next day, they like write a new episode,
*  and write a new episode, and like change their shit.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  It's such bullshit.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  I'm gonna give you a different perspective.
*  Okay.
*  This is the different perspective.
*  The different perspective is legit biologists
*  have analyzed the actual virus itself,
*  and they find all sorts of problems with this virus.
*  I had Brett Weinstein on the podcast the other day.
*  He's a professor, a legit biologist,
*  and he was discussing all of the indicators in the virus
*  that seem to point to the fact
*  that this has probably been leaked from a lab,
*  and explained it in terms of the way viruses,
*  I'm gonna do a terrible job of paraphrasing it,
*  because I'm a moron, and he's brilliant.
*  But in the long run, what he's basically saying is,
*  this is a very legit virus.
*  It's very complicated,
*  because of the fact that it's been fucked with.
*  Because this is not a virus like a regular cold,
*  or like anything else that we've encountered before.
*  This is something that's really complicated,
*  and may have evolved, because it came from a lab,
*  his perspective is it may have evolved
*  to transmit better indoors.
*  And it's very vulnerable to UV light,
*  which also might be a part of it being from a lab,
*  and not something that existed in the wild,
*  that actually just jumped from a bat,
*  to a pangolin, to a person, or what have you.
*  So legit scientists and biologists
*  who are not a part of the narrative,
*  they're not working for any government agency,
*  they're not a part of the news media
*  that's trying to transmit propaganda,
*  they are concerned with it,
*  and they're concerned with it
*  for very specific scientific reasons.
*  Now, me as a person who doesn't know
*  what the fuck any of that stuff I just said means, really,
*  I just repeat it, and it sounds like I'm smart.
*  But the smart people actually are worried about it
*  for very specific reasons that it could explain to you.
*  Now it's not vulnerable,
*  for a lot of people they're not gonna be vulnerable.
*  Like pro athletes, we were talking about those NBA players
*  that get it, listen, those are top of the food chain
*  stud athletes, they shake it off.
*  They're not experiencing any symptoms,
*  over and over and over again.
*  There's a lot of people that get it,
*  Idris Elba shook it off.
*  There's a lot of people that get it, shake it off.
*  They barely get it, they barely even know they have it.
*  But they're really robust, healthy people.
*  The concern is people that aren't, old people,
*  people that are vulnerable,
*  when they get it, man, they get it bad.
*  And I was reading an article today
*  about a woman who's been sick with COVID for 100 days now,
*  and she still has days where she has
*  these horrible flu-like symptoms, and she gets real wheezy.
*  But I think she has multiple sclerosis,
*  and she's got some other underlying health conditions.
*  So those people have to really be worried about this,
*  because it's not predictable,
*  and they don't know how to treat it totally,
*  especially in the beginning.
*  Turned out, when they put people on ventilators,
*  my buddy Michael Yeoh got it, and he got it early on.
*  And his doctor told him, if I put you on a ventilator,
*  you're probably gonna die,
*  because your body's gonna stop breathing for itself,
*  and it's gonna let the ventilator do all the work.
*  The ventilator, like, 90% of people put on ventilators.
*  I think it's 80.
*  80%.
*  For anything ever die.
*  Is that true?
*  I don't know.
*  That's what I heard.
*  Sounds good, sounds terrifying.
*  Say 80%.
*  So when Como's like, we need 40,000 ventilators,
*  because who are you saving
*  when 80% of those people are gonna die?
*  The thing is, though, I think the ventilator,
*  one way you could look at it,
*  the ventilator is such a last-ditch effort,
*  that by the time you get to the, what is that?
*  What do you have there?
*  Oh, Budweiser.
*  Ice cold, delicious.
*  Bud heavy for you, my friend.
*  What a good man, he brings his own beer.
*  You fucking stud.
*  I come with all kinds of gifts.
*  Oh, I brought you some Ignite stuff, too.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Dan Senses.
*  Shout out to Dan Bilzerian.
*  He told me he's writing a book.
*  I think he did write his book.
*  Look at that, there you go.
*  This is dog stuff, right?
*  Yeah, that one's for Marshall.
*  Oh, yay, he'll love it.
*  My dog's been using it, too.
*  It's really good stuff.
*  You know, Dan, everything's the best.
*  Yeah, I know, I'm sure.
*  It's funny how he's jumped balls deep into weed and CBD.
*  Yeah.
*  All right, look at that, dog CBD.
*  It even says it on there.
*  I fucked up with CBD MD,
*  and I took some of their dog CBD.
*  It was delicious peanut butter flavor.
*  I think it's fine, though.
*  Sure, why not?
*  What's the difference?
*  I mean, it's just CBD,
*  but they make it flavored for dogs.
*  What's that, more shit?
*  Yeah.
*  Look at this.
*  Dan Golzarian, you generous fella.
*  All right, okay, cool, CBD and t-shirts and shit.
*  What is the bull for?
*  What is all that?
*  What is the ram's head?
*  I think it's a goat head.
*  It seems satanic.
*  I asked him once about it,
*  and I can't remember what the answer was,
*  but I think it's always been his thing.
*  That's like Satan, right?
*  What is the one, the devil that has the goat head?
*  Is it Beelzebub?
*  Sounds good, it sounds like that would be correct.
*  Thank you, Dan.
*  Thank you, Satan.
*  No, who is it?
*  Which one?
*  You gotta be careful.
*  You get people so high that they get super paranoid
*  and they look down at that goat head.
*  Baphomet.
*  Oh, Baphomet, that's right.
*  I've seen him on things before.
*  That's like something Duncan would know a lot about.
*  That's right, I was trying to think of Duncan
*  and think of words he said about that.
*  Come on, man.
*  Hey, Dan, why is that guy on the cover of your fucking box?
*  Why is that goat dude with eagle wings?
*  That guy is creepy as fuck with his pentagram on his head.
*  This is interesting.
*  Houston ICU capacity could soon be exceeded
*  as COVID-19 hospitalizations worsen.
*  All the videos come out and it's like people
*  and going to the hospitals and there's no lines
*  that they're trying to make it out to be,
*  there's a lot of fuckery going on with this misinformation.
*  And that's, I have a hard time just believing
*  the newest of the new.
*  But there's also real shit going on.
*  Okay, Dr. Peter Hotez, he's been on the podcast before,
*  National School of Tropical Medicine Diseases,
*  Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
*  He's a brilliant guy.
*  Yeah, it says the city of Houston,
*  which is known for its medical schools,
*  has a large concentration of beds
*  and research hospitals and whatnot,
*  and they're very close to running out
*  of all of their ICU beds.
*  He said he called on the state to reimpose
*  more aggressive social distancing restrictions.
*  See, he's not a foolish person.
*  If he's saying this, he's a legit scientist and a doctor
*  and he knows a tremendous amount about diseases.
*  I met him many, many years ago.
*  He kind of freaked me out because we were doing this,
*  I interviewed him for this sci-fi thing
*  and he was telling me that people that live
*  in tropical climates all have parasites.
*  I'm like, all of them?
*  He goes, all of them.
*  So everybody's got something.
*  He's like, you're living in this soup of moisture and heat
*  and it's just the perfect breeding ground
*  for all these diseases.
*  And a lot of these third world countries,
*  poor folks that live in these tropical climates,
*  he's like, they all have it.
*  And when he was saying that, I was like,
*  well, of course, it makes sense.
*  There's no antibiotics, no meds.
*  It's probably just a normal part of life
*  to have all these different parasites.
*  Like people used to just drink.
*  And their immune system gets better off of it
*  or they just live with it?
*  No, man, maybe they just live with it.
*  It might be both.
*  Some people's immune systems might be stronger,
*  but like creek water, that's what people drank, man.
*  They just drank creek water.
*  And you would get beaver fever.
*  You'd get giardia.
*  It was a normal thing.
*  Talk about Mexico, right?
*  People always say, don't drink the water.
*  Don't drink the water.
*  Well, they're fucking drinking the water.
*  They drink the water all the time, right?
*  But their system is just more tolerant of it.
*  Or they're just used to shit in their pants all the time.
*  Maybe a little bit of that.
*  Maybe a little bit of that.
*  But I imagine beaver fever's got a,
*  giardia's probably killing people.
*  I mean, you're drinking horrible bacteria.
*  I know people have died from E. coli.
*  I wonder if they died from giardia.
*  Does giardia kill you?
*  Because that's a normal thing you get
*  if you drink out of a creek.
*  So your guy that you were talking about,
*  the really smart guy.
*  Peter Hotez?
*  Peter Hotez.
*  He says it was made in the lab then.
*  Okay, no, that's Brett Weinstein.
*  Brett Weinstein.
*  Brett Weinstein, yeah, he's the biologist.
*  He said, he does not talk like that.
*  He does not say it was made in the lab.
*  He's like, all indications would point to,
*  he's one of those guys.
*  But he's never like, so therefore it does.
*  So that would support the Wuhan lab
*  that's not far from the Wuhan.
*  Rarely does giardia infection, yeah, real close.
*  Rarely does giardia infection cause death,
*  but each year 4,600 persons with giardia,
*  giardiasis, let's say, are estimated to be hospitalized
*  in the United States.
*  Hospitalization, usually, primarily children under five
*  in dehydration are the most frequent co-diagnosis.
*  Yeah, probably dehydrated,
*  and then you drank that shitty water.
*  Like the fact that dehydration is like one of the
*  co-inciting factors, like yeah, dude, they drink.
*  Or that dirty water gets you so sick that you piss and shit
*  all of the water out of you.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  It's like babies get dehydrated when they're sick, right?
*  Yeah, that's probably a better perspective.
*  That's more likely.
*  So Pedialyte's for it, right?
*  Yeah, yep, yep.
*  Do you take any electrolytes?
*  Like when you're training?
*  Not really.
*  Dude, I just started over the last year.
*  I started taking one of my sponsors,
*  they sent me this liquid IV stuff.
*  Electrolytes make a big fucking difference.
*  Yeah, it makes a big difference in how quickly you hydrate.
*  It makes a big difference in stopping cramps.
*  Stops all the cramps.
*  I heard that being dehydrated, any level of dehydration
*  reduces athletic output by like 20%.
*  Which is one of the things I've been fucking sounding
*  the alarm on forever, we gotta stop weight cutting.
*  Guys, I want people to fight healthy,
*  and I want them to fight for as long as they can.
*  Look, DC had kidney failure before,
*  and that's why he didn't get into the Olympics at one point.
*  Kidney failure, Daniel Cormier.
*  He's had real problems from cutting weight, man.
*  It's fucking terrible for you.
*  That's why he fights so good at heavyweight.
*  When he's at heavyweight, he doesn't have to deal
*  with any of that bullshit.
*  He can just eat and train and just recover.
*  When you're dehydrating yourself to that extent,
*  to the extent that some guy, like Paulo Costa,
*  that motherfucker, Chael Sonnen had a video he had on YouTube.
*  I urge you to go to Chael Sonnen's YouTube
*  and listen to him talk about it.
*  He was watching Paulo Costa.
*  Paulo Costa's 230 plus pounds.
*  He cuts down to 185 for a fight.
*  That's insane.
*  That's insane.
*  How low does he get before it's just water?
*  I don't know, man.
*  You gotta see the video of him now.
*  He looks like a fucking heavyweight.
*  Because he recovered from surgery, right?
*  So he had, I believe he severed one of his biceps
*  after his fight with Yoel.
*  So he had to get it reattached.
*  And it's a long recovery process.
*  So I guess he just got big.
*  He's huge, man.
*  Well, it's like Anthony Johnson.
*  He was fighting at, what, 70?
*  170, yeah.
*  I remember when he was on the local circuit out here
*  and he was fighting at 70.
*  And then just keep going up, keep going up, keep going up.
*  Thing is, if he can make 70 for the first few minutes
*  until his body starts giving out, holy shit.
*  That dude's terrifying.
*  Terrifying.
*  What weight class he's in.
*  Terrifying as a light heavyweight.
*  This motherfucker.
*  Bro, icing people like Glover to Shara
*  with one punch as a light heavyweight.
*  And he just throws everything with zero fucks.
*  Zero fucks.
*  I love it.
*  He's like, you're gonna take me down?
*  Whoa, I'm fucking giving it.
*  He got an iron chin.
*  That's a big factor.
*  Like Anthony can take it.
*  You can't just put him out.
*  He hit so goddamn hard, man.
*  The fucking Minotauro punch,
*  when he clipped him with that uppercut and flatlined him,
*  he did the same thing to Glover.
*  He could take people out with one shot
*  like nobody else in the sport.
*  And Glover was on like a 20 fight or something crazy.
*  Something crazy.
*  Windsheek, right?
*  Well, he lost to John Jones before that.
*  John Jones did some really clever shit in that fight.
*  And he did something that I'm kind of amazed
*  that people don't do more often.
*  John had an overhook on Glover's arm
*  and they were in the clinch.
*  And John wrenched his fucking arm up
*  in a way that I've never seen anybody do before.
*  Like a mirror lock style?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Almost like a shoulder lock.
*  He got him in some kind of a shoulder lock.
*  And he did it from there.
*  So John has his arm.
*  Like Glover's got an arm.
*  He gave him the underhook.
*  And John's got his arm.
*  And Sears right there.
*  And John fucking yanked his fucking shoulder.
*  And afterwards Glover's telling me,
*  he's like, oh, my shoulder's fucked.
*  He kept fighting the fight with it,
*  but made a big impact on his ability
*  to throw the right hand and grapple.
*  They're a savage shoulder crank.
*  It was pretty savage, man.
*  It was pretty savage.
*  And what's interesting is again, it's not,
*  hey, let's see it, let's watch it.
*  Very rare, man.
*  Look at that.
*  And did a couple times.
*  Dude.
*  I mean, he fucked his shoulder there.
*  And we all have fucked up shoulders anyway.
*  Everybody does.
*  It's just so bad.
*  Such a weird joint.
*  And for a guy like John, who first of all
*  has massive leverage, this is a terrible.
*  Cosmo.
*  Cosmo's a G.
*  He's a bad motherfucker.
*  Such a bad motherfucker.
*  That's due to Sage Northcutt in 1FC.
*  Nobody saw that coming.
*  I saw that lineup, but I was like, bro,
*  this is totally what's gonna happen.
*  They want that to happen.
*  For sure.
*  There's something about 1FC, and I'm not saying
*  the UFC wouldn't do the exact same thing,
*  because they absolutely would.
*  But they would love to have those guys
*  and have them go over there and get their ass kicked.
*  The only one who's proved everybody wrong,
*  not even proved everybody wrong,
*  but proven his greatness in that regard is DJ.
*  Cos DJ's still dominating.
*  Mighty Mouse is still dominating.
*  Even over there, they're throwing their best killers at him.
*  And he's still dominating.
*  But he's just so technical.
*  He's so good.
*  He's so good.
*  If you wanna teach somebody,
*  you wanna show somebody what the best is,
*  that's it, Mighty Mouse.
*  No argument.
*  I say the GOAT is John Jones.
*  And I say the GOAT is John Jones
*  cos John Jones has beat everybody in his fucking division.
*  He's never lost to anybody.
*  Anybody.
*  I can't look at John Jones and the guys he's beaten.
*  Look at Paul McCallister, he's fucking huge.
*  Fucking insane.
*  He's huge.
*  That is fucking insane.
*  Look how big he is.
*  He's so big.
*  So Chael Sundin's video's excellent.
*  He says he's 230 plus pounds.
*  And look, not fat.
*  Gigantic.
*  So John, I think John's the GOAT.
*  John's beat everybody.
*  He turned back every single challenge.
*  He's never lost once.
*  The only fight that he has in L
*  was the disqualification of fight he was totally dominant in.
*  If anything, that fight should be changed to a no contest.
*  And also, that rule should be amended.
*  It's a silly rule.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  Super stupid rule.
*  It's one of the dumbest rules that we still keep.
*  That's again another thing where I say,
*  we all know it's stupid but they don't change it.
*  You know what's crazy, dude?
*  It's not even the best elbow.
*  You know it's not the best elbow.
*  That's not the best elbow.
*  You're an elbow expert.
*  You can speak to this.
*  You're stitching up Joe Schilling.
*  It's not great.
*  It's not a great elbow.
*  It's okay.
*  It's a one elbow for Muay Thai.
*  The downward elbow is like, it's G shit for sure.
*  Love doing that.
*  For sure doing that.
*  If you can step on a dude's thigh and oom bak,
*  I'm right in the fucking dump.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean, I've never been,
*  I'm not gonna oom bak anybody but like a jump elbow.
*  Anytime I fought in Thailand,
*  I always had at least one or two of those in the fight.
*  For sure I'm gonna throw that.
*  But that's not the most dangerous.
*  Like they, you know you've told the story a hundred times
*  but they thought because he could break blocks of ice
*  that it's too dangerous.
*  But meanwhile that position doesn't even exist
*  on the ground anyway.
*  If they understood leverage of like the human body,
*  the position of standing,
*  oh I just killed the light.
*  Oh sorry.
*  We have this floating magnetic light that I just killed.
*  Did I pull the thing out?
*  The plug's over there.
*  No.
*  What was I just saying?
*  John Jones, the goat, Mighty Mouse.
*  Oom bak, elbows.
*  So that's the only reason why John Jones ever lost
*  is cause he did the downward elbow.
*  And most people thought that stoppage was ridiculous.
*  They said, come on man, he just won the fight.
*  He won the fight.
*  You can't take it away from him for that.
*  And that had almost no impact on the fight.
*  He was gonna fuck him up.
*  He was fucking him up before that.
*  He was gonna fuck him up there.
*  Yeah, don't, they should take away that rule first of all.
*  But two, you can't take that and turn it into a loss.
*  That's not a loss.
*  And it's always a gray area anyway when you do the elbow.
*  Every time I ask them about it, they're always like,
*  as long as there's an arc, show me an arc.
*  You watch that video, you could definitely show
*  that there was some sort of arc on some angle
*  and it's not that big a deal.
*  And my hand was getting his ass kicked anyway.
*  It was not changing the impact.
*  He was getting smashed by the goat.
*  That's really what it was.
*  For sure.
*  So there's him, John Jones,
*  this is the top of the food chain.
*  I think just by results, undeniable.
*  But then technical, it's Mighty Mouse.
*  Mighty Mouse is the most technically gifted guy
*  I've ever seen inside the Octagon.
*  I don't even mean gifted in any negative way.
*  He just didn't have to work for it.
*  I mean, talented.
*  I mean, just, but he puts it together.
*  Gifted in that, he had Matt Hume for an instructor,
*  for sure, that's a big factor.
*  Because that guy is a real bonafide martial arts wizard.
*  And has been for, since I can remember.
*  Always was the guy that people were talking about.
*  He knows so much.
*  Rich Franklin, he was champ, was working with him too.
*  And he actually fought Pat Miletich
*  way back in the day, dude.
*  Those guys were legit pioneers,
*  but Matt Hume's always been super, super technical.
*  So you got DJ, who's like Matt Hume,
*  who's one of the great minds of the sport.
*  And then you got this star pupil,
*  is the most spectacular, talented, and technical fighter.
*  In terms of just overall technique,
*  I think Mighty Mouse is the most spectacular example
*  of mixed martial arts I've ever seen.
*  And as a champion, and as a marketable person,
*  never gets in trouble, never, you know what I mean?
*  Just super nice guy.
*  Super nice guy.
*  Please video games.
*  If John Jones had an asterisk,
*  that would be his asterisk, right?
*  But like, Mighty Mouse.
*  John Jones' asterisk is wild motherfucker.
*  That's what he is.
*  Also a wild motherfucker, so be careful.
*  He's wild, he's gonna make mistakes,
*  he's gonna do wild, crazy shit.
*  He's also gonna open up on Mauricio Shogunhua
*  in the youngest ever time a person wins a UFC title.
*  Opens up that fight with a flying knee
*  on Mauricio Shogunhua.
*  Who the fuck does that?
*  You gotta be a wild motherfucker.
*  For sure.
*  You got your tile fight, you're 22 years old,
*  you're in there with a fucking legend from Pride,
*  and you open with a flying knee and stagger him
*  and wind up stopping him.
*  Whatever, right?
*  That's the goat, that's the goat.
*  But then you got Anderson Silva in his prime,
*  like ooh, Anderson Silva in his prime was terrifying.
*  When he front kicked Vitor in the face,
*  when Anderson Silva was in his prime,
*  he smashed Chael Sonnen in the rematch,
*  even when he caught Chael Sonnen in a triangle
*  off his back in a fight where,
*  he went into that fight with fucked up ribs.
*  He probably shouldn't even taken that fight,
*  and Chael just kept taking him down,
*  he couldn't stop the takedown.
*  And eventually got him in a triangle off his back,
*  and it's like oh shit, he's got him.
*  The Rich Franklin fight.
*  Oh my God.
*  With B. Rich Franklin it was like no one,
*  what is this clinch that he's doing, what is, you know.
*  No one, was that crazy for you to watch
*  because you were already fighting Muay Thai.
*  Yeah, and it was like,
*  Rich didn't know how to defend the clinch,
*  but it was still at that level on the thing,
*  it was fucking phenomenal.
*  And then it was like the spectrum of it.
*  Well he was one of the most technical strikers ever
*  at that point.
*  Like we had never seen a guy who moved that good.
*  And I had seen him fight a bunch of times in pride,
*  but then when he went into greatness,
*  was like when he was like 30ish,
*  because that's when he started fighting in cage warriors.
*  And then he fought with Tony Franklin,
*  the backward elbow.
*  Backward elbow on Tony Franklin,
*  and he fought,
*  God damn it, he fought quite, oh Lee Murray.
*  That was a big one.
*  That was when Lee Murray was a straight up killer.
*  We talk about Lee Murray every time I'm on the show.
*  You have to.
*  Great story every time.
*  You have to talk about him.
*  Go ahead, finish it.
*  He's a God damn Guy Ritchie movie.
*  Lee Murray's a Guy Ritchie movie.
*  He's a human Guy Ritchie movie.
*  For people who don't know who he is,
*  he was in a bank with a bunch of other dudes,
*  and they got away with like $500 million.
*  And then he jetted off to Morocco for a little bit,
*  was hiding out over there,
*  and then eventually got caught, and now he's in jail.
*  It was actually at one point in time,
*  he was losing weight to try to slip in between the bars.
*  He was convinced that if he could get down
*  to a certain weight, he could get through the bars.
*  This should be a movie about him for sure.
*  I think Guy Ritchie has gotta be on the case.
*  If anybody's making that movie,
*  it's gonna be Guy Ritchie.
*  That'd be great.
*  But yeah.
*  That would be great.
*  Jorge Rivera too, that was another fight over there.
*  When he fought Jorge Rivera in Cage Warriors,
*  that was the one where he let him punch him in the face.
*  You remember that?
*  He entered, he stood right in front of him.
*  He stood right in front of him, and he goes, go ahead.
*  And he punches him, he turns his head,
*  he punches him, he turns his,
*  and he marches him down, starts kicking his ass.
*  It's crazy.
*  See if you can find that.
*  I don't remember that.
*  It's one of those ones where Mark Delagrate
*  was in Jorge's corner, and he said he's seeing him
*  punch Anderson in the face, like,
*  oh shit, he's gonna fuck him up, oh shit, he's gonna fuck.
*  And he goes, when Anderson feels nothing
*  and doesn't even react, he's like, oh no.
*  No.
*  Oh no.
*  Because I mean, he tees off with several clean punches
*  on Anderson, and Anderson's letting him do it.
*  And then Anderson just starts marching him down
*  and beating him up.
*  And that was what I was accustomed to.
*  So I had seen those big three fights over in Cage Warriors.
*  And so then when he came to the UFC
*  and he fought Chris Liebman, I was like, oh my God,
*  bet the house on the Brazilian.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Here it is right here.
*  This is the fight.
*  And this is, and by the way, this organization,
*  it's Cage Warriors, right?
*  Cage Rage.
*  Cage Rage?
*  Yeah.
*  That's right, Cage Warriors is a big organization now.
*  Right.
*  Okay, that's right, Cage Rage.
*  Cage Rage.
*  So this organization.
*  And they use cargo net for fence
*  instead of chain link fence, it's a cargo net.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  That's right.
*  It's kind of dope.
*  This organization had some great fights, man.
*  There was some really big fights that came out of here
*  where guys like these two were going at it.
*  And then eventually Anderson rolls on to become the goat.
*  And this was like Rivera had been fighting in the UFC
*  with much success.
*  He was a good guy, a very tough guy.
*  But this was a fight where Anderson just kind of showed
*  how far ahead he is.
*  So he's standing right in front of him,
*  marching him down. I do remember this.
*  And at one point in time, just lets him start punching him.
*  He just knew how to move away from shit just enough.
*  And the thing about a guy that fights like Anderson,
*  he's had such a fucking insanely high level
*  for these three or four years.
*  This fight, the Vitor fight,
*  the two fights with Rich Franklin.
*  I really feel like for an athlete, a real elite athlete,
*  this is the time.
*  Like, look at this.
*  He's like standing in front of him in the clinch
*  and he's letting him punch him in the face.
*  He hit him like three or four times in the face.
*  Like, look at this.
*  This is the scene.
*  Look, he's just letting him hit him.
*  Look, look at it.
*  Look at this.
*  He's letting him hit him.
*  And that's when De La Gratia was like, oh no.
*  Because Jorge's a big puncher.
*  So for Anderson to clinch with him
*  and let him punch him in the face like that,
*  and then just start marching him down,
*  they were like, how do we win this fight?
*  And this was Anderson in his prime.
*  And then Anderson in his prime,
*  when he fought Chris Lee,
*  and that's Anderson in his prime.
*  There was quite a few fights
*  where he exhibited an insane level of ability.
*  Yeah, the lead man fight was like,
*  oh my God, it was terrifying.
*  Holy shit, this dude just fucking iced you.
*  Yeah, I had a few friends come to that,
*  and I was telling them, like, dude, go bet on this guy.
*  I think he threw like 100%.
*  Like, every shot he threw was like, dude, dude, dude.
*  Everything landed and then finished.
*  Yeah, and that was back in the day.
*  They didn't know anything.
*  Like, the line, the betting lines, they were wacky.
*  Guys would come in, and people didn't know.
*  I got them like that.
*  You gotta bet on that guy.
*  Like, bet on that guy.
*  They don't know who he is.
*  Oh my God, he's gonna fuck everybody up.
*  There was a few of those guys,
*  but no better example than Anderson.
*  Like, they were pretty hyped on Anderson being here,
*  but it wasn't nearly,
*  it should have been like 1,000 to one odds.
*  That was one of those fights where you're just like,
*  oh my God, there's a perfect style to Matador,
*  because Lee was so powerful and so tough,
*  and he would take one to give one.
*  Like, you can't take one to give one with Anderson Silva.
*  Not that level.
*  Anderson's like slick and moves his feet,
*  and stays, and Liebman's like a fucking truck guy, you know?
*  It's not hard to hit.
*  But the way Anderson pulled it off
*  was like fucking poetry, man.
*  The combinations he hit him with, just poetry.
*  Just, you know, if you're a fan of like beautiful timing
*  and poise under pressure,
*  because Liebman's coming with nuclear bombs, right?
*  Liebman knocked out Van Der Le, remember?
*  And Liebman's thing was he's dangerous when you hit him.
*  It was after you, I mean, Liebman,
*  it was like four fights or a couple fights in a row,
*  where Liebman got like drilled and would come back,
*  probably rocked it blindly and knock a guy out cold.
*  Was it Ed Herman? One of the best left hands ever.
*  There's a few fights like that.
*  He had a few crazy wars.
*  But when he knocked out Vanderlei Silva,
*  I was like, holy shit, Chris Liebman.
*  You just knocked out the axe murderer.
*  But he was that guy.
*  If he clipped you, man, you had real problems.
*  He's a tough motherfucker, too.
*  But that style was tailor-made for Anderson.
*  So I think there's an argument about Anderson, too.
*  There's an argument, if you look at years,
*  like years of being amazing,
*  there's an argument that he's,
*  I mean, God damn, there was a few years
*  where Anderson was just almost untouchable.
*  Yeah, but then you look at like,
*  George St. Pierre.
*  Yep.
*  You know, like,
*  Good argument there, too.
*  But his whole career, he was untouchable, consistent.
*  And then when he did lose a fight,
*  he came back and like, you know,
*  justified it and did it well.
*  I think like, he's got to be up there.
*  Oh, he's got to be up there.
*  At like, every level of the fight game.
*  Yep.
*  I would say right beyond or under DJ.
*  Yep.
*  He's in the conversation, right?
*  I think there's a real problem with having a goat,
*  a goat, cause they're all fighting different divisions.
*  Well, it's of all time,
*  and of all time hasn't happened yet.
*  Yeah, it never ends.
*  You know?
*  But who the fuck is going to beat John's record?
*  Like Chuck Liddell in his day.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Chuck Liddell was like my idol, my hero, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  He was, it was interesting that Rampage
*  was his kryptonite, you know?
*  Rampage was his kryptonite over in Pride,
*  and it just shows you like, it's styles, you know?
*  For sure.
*  Some guys have a style to beat certain guys,
*  but some people will figure their number out.
*  You know, it's such a weird sport, man.
*  There's so many things going on, you know?
*  It's just, your transition from going through Muay Thai
*  to kickboxing to MMA, I mean, you're one of the rare guys
*  like you and Gaston, and there's a few other dudes
*  who have really competed in all of the major combat sports,
*  other than boxing.
*  Japanese boxing fights?
*  I set the US record for the fastest knockout
*  in US history.
*  Did you really?
*  A month's pro boxing debut, thank you very much.
*  No shit.
*  When was this?
*  Five seconds, oh man.
*  Whoa.
*  It was, fuck, I don't even know.
*  Dude, I didn't even know you boxed.
*  I had like three professional boxing fights.
*  I had about 15 professional, or professional,
*  amateur boxing fights.
*  Yeah, I fought a Hollywood Park casino, I fought a guy.
*  I was supposed to fight Fernando Vargas' brother,
*  and he pulled out like the week before the fight,
*  and they got some guy from Wildcard.
*  And this guy like, I'd like this Mike Tyson, I guess.
*  He's like, what is his name?
*  Italian guy, and he had a Mike Tyson tattoo
*  on the side of his face.
*  Oh my God.
*  And he's got black high tops with no socks
*  and the black shorts when we get in the ring.
*  I'm like, this dude just looks not there, like not there.
*  Like a bad cop?
*  Like a bad cop.
*  Like you just see him on site.
*  Like this guy's not all there, right?
*  So it like stares me down, I go back to the corner,
*  and my coach, we've been training for the boxing fight,
*  I was like, man, this dude's gonna rush me,
*  and he's like, don't fucking kick him.
*  He's gonna rush me right off the bat.
*  He's like, hit him.
*  So like in boxing, kickboxing,
*  they always like walks through the center kind of,
*  and they're like, get ready to fight.
*  Boxing and MMA, you ready over there,
*  you ready over there, ready to go.
*  So he says, ready to fight, ready to fight,
*  come on through.
*  And I take like one step forward,
*  and I put my left hand out,
*  because I know the guy's gonna rush me.
*  And sure enough, he just starts sprinting.
*  He's like running over,
*  and he's gonna throw the overhand right,
*  and I was like, oh shit,
*  and I dropped step to the right hand,
*  he ran into it, knocked him out cold,
*  and it was five seconds.
*  If I would've taken,
*  it was tied for the world record at the time,
*  or the world record was four seconds,
*  the US record was five seconds.
*  And if I would've taken one step forward,
*  one more step before I planned it and put my foot out,
*  I would've set the record.
*  But anyway, yeah, I have a pro boxing putt.
*  I have a pro boxing putt.
*  I have a pro boxing putt.
*  Dude, the first big thing that Glory did at,
*  Dude, the first big thing that Glory did at,
*  the forum, was that the Last Man Standing event?
*  The one that you were at?
*  Yeah.
*  It was Last Man Standing.
*  Was that the first big event they did at the forum?
*  First one at the forum, yeah.
*  That was crazy, man.
*  They had done Glory 10 the year before,
*  which was when I won the tournament.
*  I fought Artem and Kengo Shimizu.
*  Yeah, the Artem Levin fight was awesome.
*  And the knee that you caught him with
*  on the way down, too, was perfect.
*  Man, I still, I guess it didn't matter I won.
*  But I think I knocked him out with the Superman,
*  and when he was falling on the way down,
*  I hit him with the knee and I woke him up.
*  I've done that a couple times in my career.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  You could actually wake someone up with a punch.
*  You would think he wouldn't care,
*  but he eats at me at night.
*  I'm like, fuck, I coulda had that.
*  Never know, though.
*  That's speculation, right?
*  Right, I don't know.
*  He definitely had him fucked up from the punch, too.
*  But I felt like the knee did more damage.
*  I felt like it helped.
*  Wanna see it?
*  Yeah, absolutely, I wanna see it.
*  Get Joe Schilling drops Artem Levin.
*  And he was a bad motherfucker, man.
*  That guy's so interesting.
*  Bad motherfucker.
*  Interesting style.
*  You know, weird.
*  Like, you could see. Tricky.
*  He's like a real technician.
*  Very, very slick, very hard to hit.
*  And he'll throw shit with no telegraphing,
*  particularly his low kicks.
*  They come out of nowhere.
*  There's no step.
*  He just smacks them in there on you sometimes.
*  He'll do it all, he has all these change up speeds.
*  If you ever watch Fador fight,
*  he does a lot of, I don't know if you'll understand it,
*  but Russian boxing is a little different.
*  They have a little different footwork
*  and their movements and stuff.
*  And Fador does come out of stuff,
*  and Artem for sure does it a lot.
*  Yeah, he's slick, man.
*  He's real slick.
*  This is a great fucking fight, by the way.
*  This is the very end.
*  So Artem is real tall, and he's real hard to hit.
*  I had a real hard time reaching him with punches.
*  So every time I would throw the right hand,
*  he would lean back just out of range
*  where I couldn't reach him.
*  And that's why I threw the Superman punch,
*  so I could jump a few feet farther.
*  Just let some of it roll.
*  Just let it roll, doesn't matter.
*  My favorite knockout of yours ever though
*  was Simon Marcus.
*  That was crazy.
*  That was crazy, because that was a wild ass fight.
*  And you were there for it.
*  You felt the arena that night.
*  Oh my God, dude.
*  That gave me hope for kickboxing, it really did.
*  It gave me a lot of hope for kickboxing as well.
*  Because I was like, the forum is fucking packed,
*  and the fights were wild, man.
*  I mean, it was a wild event.
*  When you threw that right hand haymaker
*  and caught Simon Marcus on the chin,
*  you see his jaw snap sideways,
*  and his mouthpiece go flying out.
*  That was one of the prettiest knockouts ever.
*  And also because of the fact the fight was so close,
*  it was so much chaos.
*  That fight was wild, dude.
*  And he dropped you in the second,
*  was it in the second round?
*  Yep, second round.
*  And it was like, oh shit, it was a fucking war, man.
*  There was so much heavy bombing on each other.
*  And this is a tournament.
*  You had to fight four times that night?
*  Three times. Three times.
*  Dude.
*  And we had fought twice in the past,
*  and we had a lot of animosity.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I mean, yes, you know. Tension.
*  A lot of tension, a lot of animosity.
*  Just competitive drive.
*  Glory kind of got big in the US,
*  where just after we had started,
*  Muay Thai had started growing in the US.
*  Lion Fight started doing well.
*  And a lot of that happened because of Simon and I's
*  two fights in Lion Fight.
*  I started Can't Stop Crazy.
*  We started doing our own interviews.
*  We were giving, talking shit back and forth.
*  There was a hype behind the whole thing.
*  We bet our first purse for the fight.
*  Oh wow.
*  On our first fight.
*  Yeah, our first fight.
*  We bet our purses.
*  Mine was a little bigger, so I matched his purse,
*  but it was still in the media.
*  It was known that we were betting our purses on the fight.
*  We sold out the Hard Rock, the pond or whatever for,
*  was it the Pearl? The pond?
*  The Pearl, the pond.
*  Yeah.
*  You had some wild fights with him.
*  So then when we came back later, he had beat me twice.
*  Beat me twice.
*  So you had to give him up your purse?
*  Yeah, when I lost.
*  How bad did that sound?
*  It was like six grand, but I was only making,
*  not only did I think it was that much,
*  it was like, I think he made three grand.
*  I mean, I went home with a thousand bucks,
*  which at the time was a lot.
*  It sucked. It was terrible.
*  And I wanted the rematch, and then we had the rematch,
*  and there was controversy behind that too.
*  And then years later we fought in glory,
*  and it was like redemption.
*  I knocked him out in the extra round.
*  It was fucking dope.
*  Fourth round, man.
*  I'll never forget it, because after the third,
*  I was like, what?
*  They gotta go one more round of this?
*  Because it was such a fucking crazy fight.
*  I was gonna bring this,
*  Gladry, you brought that up.
*  So remember everybody's talking about this week
*  in the fight where the Drysdale,
*  they were telling him to stop the fight.
*  And he was like, Drysdale's just trying to be a coach,
*  try to keep it going and whatever.
*  And there's a lot of people saying,
*  if the fighter says he doesn't wanna do it anymore,
*  whatever.
*  That's Simon Marcus fight after three rounds.
*  Now I wasn't begging my coach to stop it,
*  but I did not wanna go another fucking round.
*  And I was like, oh, did I win?
*  And I was like, I think you're gonna have to do one more.
*  And I'm like, fuck, I can't do one more.
*  I don't wanna do one more.
*  I can't do one more.
*  And my coach is like, fucking,
*  you can do it one more round.
*  There you are right there.
*  There you are right there.
*  And I'm like, I'm gonna do it.
*  This is it.
*  Boom, nope, that's not the punch.
*  A lot of fighters experience that.
*  And it's the coach's job, I think,
*  to try to keep them going.
*  So I'm on Drysdale's side on that.
*  But ultimately he didn't fight anyway.
*  They stopped it, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, ultimately he did.
*  But it was very, very controversial.
*  But I get Drysdale's position.
*  And listen, in retrospect,
*  after the conversation is over,
*  yeah, maybe you should have called it
*  when the guy said, call it.
*  But in the moment, he doesn't know
*  that he can't talk the guy into fighting
*  and then maybe the guy wins.
*  Like, you don't know what a person's
*  psychological mindset is like
*  unless you train with that person.
*  And there are some people that you can talk
*  into performing better.
*  That said, he took a lot of fucking punishment
*  in that second round, right?
*  Maybe he knew something.
*  Maybe it was a good thing to stop.
*  There's some times when your body's just broken.
*  There's some times when you shouldn't go on.
*  And this debate, I think, is very healthy.
*  The debate of whether or not the coach was right
*  or whether or not the guy was right.
*  But ultimately, the guy's right
*  because he can't go on so he doesn't,
*  and he quits.
*  And that's his decision.
*  Only he knows what was going on with his body.
*  You remember when Gerald McClellan got criticized
*  for taking a knee against Nigel Ben?
*  I don't know if you remember it,
*  but that's the fight that put Gerald McClellan
*  in a coma and severely handicapped him.
*  Gerald McClellan at the time was a fucking assassin man.
*  He was so scary.
*  But he was another guy that cut way too much weight.
*  He cut a lot of weight, man.
*  It was hard for him.
*  He was really big.
*  And so when he would get into the,
*  I forget if he's fought 168.
*  I think he was fighting in Roy Jones' division.
*  He's at 168 or 175.
*  Pull up Gerald McClellan versus Nigel Ben.
*  This was the dark destroyer
*  because Nigel Ben, it was a wild ass fight too.
*  Nigel's got crazy dreadlocks.
*  And Gerald McClellan knocked him through the ropes
*  in the first round because he would smash people.
*  He would just smash people.
*  He was such a, he was a cronk guy.
*  So he fought like a cronk guy,
*  just moving forward behind the jab, big right hands,
*  just nasty vicious puncher.
*  Well, Nigel Ben gets up and he makes it through the round
*  and then turns into a war.
*  And then Gerald McClellan starts getting tired
*  and then they clash heads.
*  And then Nigel Ben hits him with a couple punches
*  late in the fight.
*  And when Nigel Ben hit him, see, like this is early on.
*  I mean, this is, look like this,
*  go a little earlier than this
*  so we could see this combination.
*  But this was Gerald McClellan.
*  And everybody was like real keen on him
*  fighting Roy Jones Jr.
*  This was when Roy Jones was in his prime.
*  And this was like the big challenge was
*  Gerald McClellan, Roy Jones Jr.
*  Everybody was thinking that was eventually
*  gonna have to happen
*  because Gerald was just smashing people.
*  And Nigel Ben was tough, man.
*  He was fucking tough.
*  But look at this, boom, boom, boom.
*  He's like, he's out, man.
*  And he falls through the fucking ropes.
*  You could see he's like really out of it,
*  but so tough and so conditioned that he makes it back.
*  Look at that, barely can get through the ropes.
*  Got a lot of seconds there though, right?
*  That's probably more than 10 seconds.
*  So anyway, and look at the referee, there's more seconds.
*  And Gerald's still teeing off on him.
*  And Nigel survives.
*  It doesn't seem like he's gonna survive,
*  but he fucking survives.
*  So then late in the fight, Nigel's making a comeback.
*  So scooch way ahead here.
*  And when Nigel starts teeing off on Gerald,
*  and Gerald's punches are coming real slow,
*  and he's getting tired, and Nigel starts connecting.
*  And I mean, the crowd is going fucking bananas.
*  It is a wild ass fight.
*  And at one point in time, they headbutt,
*  and then Nigel hits him with some punches,
*  and McClellan takes a knee.
*  And everybody's like, I can't believe this.
*  He's gonna quit, he's gonna quit.
*  And then he goes to his corner,
*  and then he slumps and goes unconscious.
*  Like he knew something was wrong.
*  And anybody that criticizes in the moment,
*  they're saying, I can't believe he's doing this.
*  I can't believe he's fucking, he's just gonna quit.
*  But he knew something was really off.
*  Only the fighter knows.
*  I mean, maybe it's psychological,
*  but maybe something's wrong, man.
*  Maybe he can't think.
*  Maybe his brain is just fucked.
*  Maybe he knows he's not gonna be able to punch right.
*  Maybe he knows, there it is.
*  So he goes down and just decides to stay down.
*  He's like, something is fucking really wrong.
*  He's like out of it.
*  And you see, this is, I mean,
*  he just looks, something looks wrong.
*  Something looks wrong.
*  You know, he's hurt bad,
*  and Nigel Ben is moving in for the fucking kill.
*  And he drops in there with an uppercut,
*  and this is where he quits.
*  See, now this is where, like you see him,
*  he's struggling, man.
*  But if I remember correctly,
*  the commentators were shocked that he decided to stay down.
*  He's quit.
*  So they said it that way.
*  And you know, I think they were expressing some shock
*  that he quit and pretty pumped that Nigel Ben beat him.
*  But they didn't know.
*  And Gerald McClellan, that injury,
*  scared the fuck out of everybody
*  because he was one of the golden guys.
*  He was one of the guys that everybody was excited about.
*  It was like, if that happened today,
*  you know, to Ryan Garcia or someone like that, you know?
*  Someone who's a real exciting, up-and-coming dude.
*  Someone who's, you know, Canelo.
*  Like if Canelo just,
*  I guess Canelo was a bigger star than Gerald.
*  But when someone who's of that nature,
*  like an elite, super elite fighter,
*  winds up going into a coma like that,
*  that's fucking terrifying shit.
*  And he came out of it okay?
*  No.
*  No, he didn't.
*  No, he's all fucked up.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah, he can't see.
*  And you know, there's been some videos
*  of Roy Jones Jr. visiting him.
*  But apparently that was responsible
*  for Roy Jones kind of altering his style
*  and being very safety first and really, yeah.
*  And just thinking about eventually, you know,
*  getting out of the sport, which is ironic, right?
*  Because he wound up fighting later and later and later
*  into his life.
*  I mean, he had his last fight just a couple of years ago.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's a wild ass sport.
*  You're in Joe Schilling.
*  Yep.
*  All the aspects of it, whether it's boxing
*  or Muay Thai or MMA.
*  When is Bellator gonna start having fights again?
*  I don't know.
*  I haven't heard from them.
*  They're playing it safe, huh?
*  I guess so.
*  They don't have, I don't have a fight island, I guess.
*  But yeah, I'm not sure.
*  But you can have fights with new crowds.
*  They're letting people do that.
*  Are they doing that?
*  I mean, the UFC's done a few of them.
*  Oh man, the UFC's done it.
*  They test the fuck out of you.
*  Yeah, I was there with Daniel Rodriguez.
*  That's right.
*  And Andy Bravo.
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, we were tested every, tested when we first got
*  there and they made it take our temperature every day.
*  And they just, they bought the whole,
*  bought out the whole hotel.
*  So there was.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I was there.
*  We were social distanced the whole time.
*  Yeah, I think it's, oh no, I wasn't there for that one.
*  That was the Vegas one, right?
*  I think it's okay the way they're doing it.
*  It's working out for everybody.
*  Guys getting to fight.
*  We're all getting to see that, like that.
*  So there's something about Ferguson versus Gagey,
*  to have that in an empty arena.
*  There's something wild about it.
*  For sure.
*  There's something wild about no crowd.
*  For sure.
*  I think it added.
*  You can hear everything.
*  I think it added.
*  I mean, I don't think it's the right way to do it.
*  I think it's best with a crowd.
*  But it's not a bad thing to have no crowd.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  It's been, maybe guys could fight better too.
*  There might be guys who can like stay more calm
*  because there's less energy.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I could see a lot of people feeling that way probably.
*  Yeah, probably, right?
*  But God, cause God damn,
*  they've had some fucking wild fights.
*  That Gagey Ferguson fight was insane.
*  What a fucking fight.
*  How do you watch that fight
*  and you're not a tremendous fan of both of them after that?
*  Both of them.
*  Both of them.
*  Yeah, I mean.
*  Both of them.
*  Dude, Gagey is a stud.
*  The fact, he just figured out.
*  He just figured out how to just take a little bit off.
*  Take a little bit off,
*  step away a little bit sometimes,
*  come in at angles, faint sometimes.
*  Don't just maul people
*  cause he was breaking people's will before.
*  I think Trevor Whitman and his relationship
*  is like really special.
*  Yeah.
*  And it had a lot to do with him being able to say
*  exactly what he needed to hear to do what they did.
*  That was really impressive.
*  There's that for sure.
*  Whitman's a bad motherfucker and he's very smart.
*  And God, he loves Gagey and he loves his athletes
*  and he loves his sport.
*  No doubt about that.
*  Trevor's a wizard.
*  He really is.
*  But Gagey's something special, man.
*  Something special about that kid's mind.
*  It's his body for sure.
*  He's got awesome skills.
*  One of the best leg kickers in the clinch
*  I think I've ever seen.
*  Right.
*  He knows how to, while you're tying up in the clinch,
*  he'll fucking, just a little step and a nasty leg kick.
*  He's fucking.
*  A gas tank and a workhorse and a fucking throwing bombs.
*  And walks to the cage like he's getting to his truck
*  to go to work in the morning.
*  There's almost like there's no emotions.
*  There's nothing, no nerves, no weirdness, no craziness.
*  I don't remember the exact quote,
*  so I'm not even gonna bother saying it,
*  but it was something fucking iconic as fuck.
*  He was talking about the fights.
*  Like he's either gonna knock me or I'm gonna knock him out
*  unless it's the way it's gonna be.
*  He said it way better than that.
*  Yeah, because he's not bragging.
*  No way you could read it and not respect the fuck out of him.
*  The way he said it, it was dope.
*  That's the way he fights too.
*  Yeah, he's a cool dude.
*  Even the fights that he's lost,
*  the Poirier fight and the Eddie Alvarez fight,
*  they're fucking amazing fights, man.
*  And he almost lost the Michael Johnson fight.
*  Michael Johnson had him by in real estate on Queer Street.
*  He was dancing all over the place.
*  I mean, it was wild that he survived that
*  because Johnson has a nasty left hand.
*  And he clipped him with several punches, like big shots.
*  He had Gagey wobbled, like real wobbled.
*  That's one of those fights
*  that could have easily gone the other way.
*  Johnson could have caught him with one more shot.
*  The Poirier fight too.
*  The Poirier fight was, anyone could have had that fight.
*  Anyone could have had that fight.
*  And Poirier's leg was shot, man.
*  He chops legs like nobody, man.
*  Crazy, because he came out, he's a wrestler.
*  Wrestler, never wrestles.
*  No. Never wrestles.
*  Doesn't wrestle anybody.
*  But that's what makes him so dangerous for Khabib, right?
*  Because Khabib is the wrestler who always wrestles.
*  Obviously, showed he could drop Conor.
*  Obviously shows he's fast as fuck with his hands on his feet.
*  He's dropped guys before.
*  But he's not going, he's not a kick boxer
*  in the sense that like Gagey is.
*  When you see Gagey fighting, he's basically a kick boxer.
*  I mean, with a wrestling background skill
*  so that you can't take him down.
*  So he's forcing the kick boxing, but he stands straight up.
*  He's standing like a striker.
*  He stands like a striker.
*  Like so does Jorge, Maz Fidal.
*  He stands straight up.
*  Man, his striking is really good.
*  Damn. His fighting with Nate
*  was fucking awesome.
*  Nasty. He's so good, man.
*  So good. So clever.
*  So good. So funny.
*  He's hilarious. I think he's hilarious.
*  I really like both those guys.
*  You know what else he is?
*  He's fucking mean.
*  That's a mean dude.
*  There's something like when they asked him
*  about the Ben Askren shot,
*  was it necessary to punch him again on the ground?
*  He goes, it was super necessary.
*  That became like a big hashtag super necessary.
*  It's hilarious. I think it's hilarious.
*  But hey man, he's in the fucking hurt game.
*  You can't play your bullshit nonsense in the hurt game.
*  And if everybody's picking a gimmick or whatever,
*  and they're trying to push
*  and everyone's trying to be Connor,
*  why not be yourself who's fucking,
*  just mean, you're mean.
*  Yeah, and super talented.
*  So talented. Slick.
*  So much experience.
*  People don't know, that guy knocked out
*  Eve Edwards with a head kick in Bodog.
*  Eve Edwards.
*  Eve Edwards is a slick striker, especially back then.
*  That was Eve Edwards when Eve Edwards
*  was arguably the best 155 pounder in the world.
*  That was after he knocked out Josh Thompson
*  in that highlight reel where he throws that round kick
*  off the spin. Spinning backfist, yeah.
*  Spinning backfist, then he throws a round kick
*  and catches him right in the net.
*  It's still like the UFC's flick, the little clip.
*  And it's Josh fucking Thompson
*  who's one of the toughest guys to ever live.
*  Another monster. Another monster.
*  I mean, that was the last guy to knock out Nate.
*  Before the head kick.
*  Yeah, before Masvidal had stopped him.
*  He was the first guy to ever stop Nate.
*  Right.
*  And Josh is as good as it gets.
*  When you see that fight, I mean, that was two guys
*  who easily could have done the same to each other.
*  And just.
*  Time didn't play it out that way.
*  Eve landed the perfect shot.
*  It was a neck kick.
*  It was just fucking spectacular.
*  At that time, Eve was thought to be absolutely
*  one of the very best fighters in the world
*  and probably the best 155 pounder alive.
*  100%.
*  But the UFC changed the division.
*  They gave up the 155 division back then.
*  I remember it.
*  It was very disheartening.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was like, there's so much talent in this division.
*  But they were hammering money, man.
*  This is all pre-Ultimate Fighter.
*  They didn't know what they were doing.
*  In terms of the future, they were $44 million in debt.
*  They were like, what are we doing?
*  Are we gonna sell this?
*  Are we gonna keep it?
*  They just had their balls though.
*  Lorenzo Fertitta, Frank Fertitta, and Dana White,
*  all three of them have balls.
*  They were just like, let's just ride.
*  Let's let it ride.
*  They were calling Dana up going, look for a buyer.
*  Let's find a buyer.
*  We gotta get out of this.
*  We're not gonna lose our family's fortune.
*  We're at $44 million in the hole
*  and this cage fighting shit,
*  obviously this is too brutal for America.
*  They're not really into it.
*  But then they figured it out.
*  That Ultimate Fighter show, they financed the whole show,
*  paid for all of it.
*  Paid for the whole thing.
*  Paid to be on the network.
*  And then boom, that one final fight
*  with Forrest Griffin and Stefan Bonner
*  and these two crazy fucks
*  are beating the shit out of each other
*  and it is a wild melee of a fight.
*  And the viewership just keeps going up during the fight.
*  Millions and millions of people watched during the fight,
*  like tuned in, extra people tuned in.
*  Because people were calling their friends like,
*  bro, you gotta watch this shit.
*  This is nuts.
*  And people didn't even know what it was.
*  Like, what is this?
*  What do they got, little gloves on?
*  What is happening here?
*  And before the Ultimate Fighter,
*  there was fans of UFC or cage fighting or whatever,
*  but they didn't really get to know
*  who Chuck Liddell was that much.
*  They didn't get to know those people.
*  With the Ultimate Fighter, it was,
*  they got to know these people.
*  There was like a thing that grew.
*  And then you saw this insane fight.
*  It was, couldn't have played out better.
*  Yeah, I mean.
*  Couldn't have played out better.
*  God damn, they nailed it.
*  And then boom, and that was a Craig Pauligian show.
*  He was the guy who did Survivor.
*  Like, he knew how to do those reality shows.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, dude, he's a G.
*  He's one of the greats in terms of that genre.
*  That guy knows how to make those fucking shows.
*  That's why it was so good.
*  You know, it didn't feel like a clunky reality show.
*  It was a fun reality show to watch.
*  I said that all, oh, they're bringing it back, by the way.
*  Paulo Costa and Israel Adesanya.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Holy shit.
*  Tell me you're not gonna watch that.
*  I'm for sure gonna watch that.
*  That fight is a wild fight, man.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because Izzy.
*  I wanna see Izzy and John Jones, though.
*  I wanna see.
*  I do too, I do too, but Izzy and Costa has to happen, man.
*  When you see what Costa did to Yoel Romero,
*  walking down Yoel Romero,
*  who the fuck walks down Yoel Romero?
*  There's a picture I put up on my Instagram
*  of him head kicking Romero.
*  I mean, just clean.
*  Just clean, shin to the head.
*  And you see Romero's crazy skull,
*  turn sideways.
*  I'll tell you something that Dana White told me.
*  Yoel had an injury in one of his fights.
*  He had some sort of fractured orbital.
*  Some sort of minor fracture of the bone around his eye.
*  After the fight.
*  Yeah, after the fight.
*  During the fight, he got it, right?
*  After the fight, they sent him to a doctor.
*  The doctor calls the UFC and goes,
*  "'Where did you find this guy?'
*  And they go, "'Yeah, he's a stud, right?'
*  "'No, no, no, you don't understand.
*  "'I've never seen...'
*  And the guy was like,
*  "'I've practiced medicine for almost 50 years.'
*  He goes, "'I've never seen a person who's built like this.'
*  He said the tendons in his eyes are three times larger
*  than a normal person's.
*  Like, here's it.
*  Is that it?
*  Well, that's one of them.
*  He had kicked him several times.
*  But there's one image.
*  There's an image that I had on my Instagram
*  that is, it's so crazy.
*  It just kept beating down.
*  Head kicks over and over and over and over.
*  Oh, this is the entire thing?
*  There it is.
*  That was the one that was on my Instagram.
*  He just head kicked him over and over again.
*  Look at that.
*  That's the picture.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  The guy's just made out of metal.
*  And all the guys who fight him say that too.
*  Like, Luke Rock, look at that.
*  I mean, come on, man.
*  Derek Brunson just clanged his shin off of his head.
*  In the back of the head.
*  In the back of the head.
*  Crazy.
*  Uriah Hall and him are gonna fight.
*  That's a great fight.
*  August 22nd.
*  It's a good fight.
*  He's the most terrifying specimen.
*  So the doctor was saying,
*  what is going on with this guy?
*  He's built like no person I've ever seen in my life.
*  And so what the UFC was trying to figure out was,
*  Cuba has always had a very aggressive athlete program.
*  And they've been involved in all kinds of weird shenanigans.
*  And they're tightly connected to the Soviet Union,
*  particularly back then.
*  And he was on the Cuban Olympic team.
*  And the Soviet Union has done some really weird shit
*  when it comes to experiments on athletes.
*  And you saw the movie Icarus, right?
*  Do you ever see that movie?
*  I don't think so.
*  You need to see that movie.
*  I might have seen it.
*  It's about this guy who is...
*  The guy who made the document,
*  what is Brian's last name again?
*  The guy who made it?
*  Pull up the image of it.
*  It's a Netflix...
*  Icarus.
*  Focal, that's right.
*  Sorry, Brian.
*  I smoke too much weed.
*  So this is what...
*  So what Brian decides to do is film himself
*  competing in an endurance race, a bike race,
*  and then do it the next time, next year, juiced up.
*  So he does one year, and he does this whole thing.
*  And then he gets in touch.
*  It's an amazing documentary.
*  Then he gets in touch with this Russian guy
*  who's gonna teach him how to do it.
*  And this Russian guy works for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency,
*  or whatever they call it over there.
*  And the Russian guy, in the middle of this happening,
*  in the middle of doping him up,
*  it turns out that they catch the fact that the Russian team
*  had basically taken, in the Sochi Olympics,
*  they had basically taken all of the piss
*  that was like the clean piss,
*  the piss that people would use samples,
*  they removed them through a hole in the wall
*  and replaced them with clean piss.
*  So every single athlete had their piss swapped out.
*  And this guy, who's the Russian guy,
*  is explaining this all to this Brian Fogle guy.
*  While this is all going down the news,
*  he just stepped in shit.
*  So this is all going down the news
*  that they caught the Russian sports,
*  whatever the fuck they are,
*  they figured out there's micro scratches
*  inside these bottles that indicate
*  that these unremovable bottles
*  had actually been removed.
*  And they figured out how to do it with some sort of a tool,
*  but the tool left scratches on.
*  And they figured this out,
*  and then they found this hole in the wall,
*  like a hole that big, where they would,
*  I would hand you some dirty piss,
*  you would hand me some clean piss,
*  I'd replace the piss.
*  And so they did that with all the athletes.
*  So all the Russian athletes, most likely,
*  were reduced to the fucking kills.
*  No, no, they did it.
*  The athletes just pissed.
*  But his perspective was, it was their job to be on steroids.
*  They all were on steroids.
*  This wasn't like, they didn't get to choose.
*  It wasn't like they're cheating.
*  Like the government is making sure you cheat,
*  and they're gonna take care of you.
*  Right.
*  Dude, it's crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  It's an amazing documentary.
*  So what happens when he,
*  everybody, what's his time?
*  He has to go to the witness protection program.
*  So the guy comes to America, oh yeah, everybody's smashing.
*  Oh, no, no, he actually got injured a bunch,
*  and actually his time sucked on the second one.
*  And I think his battery broke,
*  like something broke on his bike,
*  something fucked up on his bike too.
*  Like he had some problems,
*  and so he didn't wind up doing that well.
*  That steroids work, and instead he proved that.
*  Well he proved that he gets injured.
*  Right, okay.
*  But along the way, he didn't plan,
*  he planned on doing really good on juice.
*  But he just got fucked up a bunch of times,
*  and he wound up being hurt,
*  and didn't perform that well.
*  He won the Oscar for best documentary.
*  Oh damn.
*  And he should've, it's amazing.
*  But once he did it,
*  and he starts interacting with this Russian cat,
*  who's teaching him how to do all this stuff.
*  What is the guy's name, Grigorov?
*  Yuri?
*  Doug.
*  What's his name?
*  I don't know.
*  I have no idea.
*  Grigorov?
*  These goddamn Russian names.
*  Grigory Rodchenkov.
*  Oh there it is.
*  Okay, Grigory Rodchenkov.
*  Yeah, there it is.
*  So that's the guy.
*  And I mean, he basically spills all the beans.
*  So once he realizes, like he's on the run,
*  by the way, they take away his family's money,
*  they take away all, they take away their home,
*  they made him homeless, they made his family homeless.
*  He had to leave behind his wife and his kids.
*  Like he's fucked, like it's not good.
*  And he's hiding in America.
*  He's probably in South Dakota right now.
*  A dive bar with fucking four goons
*  standing over his shoulders looking out for Russians.
*  I mean, he's fucked.
*  And he told the whole truth of how they did it,
*  why they did it, the way they've done it,
*  always in the past.
*  And it's not a coincidence that Russia,
*  like the amount of gold medalists they got
*  from that one Olympics was just staggering.
*  And then the Olympic Committee removed them
*  from the next one.
*  Like they weren't able to compete,
*  like a lot of the sports,
*  they weren't able to compete in the next Olympics.
*  Yeah, I remember that.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  But he was also detailing how crazy it is
*  that the Olympic Committee and the World Doping Agency,
*  the WADA, is it WADA?
*  Whichever one it was that tests them.
*  They're all like, they work for each other.
*  Like this guy will go to work for there
*  and that guy will go to work for here.
*  They're all buddies, we're friends over here.
*  Carl Lewis, he's a good guy.
*  Get rid of that piss here, take my piss, I'm clean.
*  And that was one of the things
*  that they had said about Lance.
*  Like Lance Armstrong getting tested for Tour De France,
*  like hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  Fucking everybody's on it.
*  You got a dirty sport, man.
*  Like if you want to take away Lance Armstrong's,
*  what is it, a green shirt or something like that?
*  What do you get?
*  Yellow jersey?
*  For being a bad motherfucker on a bike?
*  If you want to give it to the next person in line,
*  it was like 18th place.
*  It was like 26 or something.
*  Something fucking astronomical.
*  Bill Burr had a great bit about it.
*  He's like, our psycho's better than your psycho.
*  Like that's what it is, you're all a bunch of fucking nuts.
*  You're all taking drugs.
*  Like from the Russian perspective,
*  those gold medals were worth it to them
*  to fucking ruin that guy's life for lying about it, right?
*  Yes, well they wanted to kill him.
*  For sure.
*  They wanted to kill Rigora Rolfe, whatever his name is,
*  the Russian scientist.
*  They wanted to kill him.
*  That's why he's hiding.
*  He's probably gonna have to hide for the rest of his life.
*  I mean, this is just the life he chose.
*  Terrifying, man.
*  Just really terrifying.
*  But also the same thing that happened in China.
*  Beijing Olympics, Chinese won so many gold medals.
*  Yeah, wasn't it?
*  Like the little tiny gymnastic girls were on Juz or something.
*  They all fell for it, right?
*  Sure, they were on Juz.
*  All the ballerina chicks, like the walking on the beam.
*  Can you imagine juicing up a little baby?
*  Like you're gonna do the best backflips, honey.
*  Take a little of this Anadrol 50.
*  Ah!
*  Get a big old fucking.
*  We're gonna band your feet up really small
*  and lose all your toes so that you can stand
*  on your toe better, you know, from birth.
*  Did they do that?
*  They had, yeah, there used to be a thing like,
*  China would, they would take babies
*  and when they're females and baby or whatever,
*  they would like tie their feet up really tight
*  so that their feet would not grow and they'd be really small.
*  Yeah, but that was just for aesthetics, right?
*  It was like a sign of something.
*  Yeah, like you have little feet.
*  The old women can't walk because their feet are tiny
*  because whatever, because they're small.
*  Have you ever seen the images of the feet
*  when they bind them?
*  Well, you're about to.
*  Jamie?
*  Chinese foot bonding.
*  That's like, people do weird shit, man.
*  Like I have friends who have those big ear holes.
*  Like that's okay.
*  Shout out to Boogie, my friend Richie Martinez.
*  The big.
*  He's got big old ear holes.
*  I had a student at the gym that I'm like,
*  bro, you can't spar with that.
*  You're not gonna be able to fight like that.
*  He's like, no, it's cool.
*  And he would take the big hole and flip it over the top.
*  Oh my God.
*  And I'm like, all right, you can spar, but.
*  Look at that lady's feet.
*  You look terrible.
*  Bro, look how her toes are tucked under her feet.
*  So her little toe is tucked under
*  and she stands on her toenail
*  and it's dug into a groove in her foot.
*  Just goes to show you how flexible people are,
*  pliable.
*  Look at her.
*  There's her standing around with her husband.
*  He's like, still too big.
*  Look at that.
*  That's so nasty.
*  Look at her feet, man.
*  That's a little fuse for her.
*  Go back to that other picture of her with her feet out.
*  That's crazy, man.
*  Imagine doing that to yourself.
*  That has to hurt like hell.
*  She's looking down on them.
*  Yeah, and they hurt like hell for years.
*  Yeah, forever.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Just the process.
*  Oh yeah, to get to that.
*  To get to that, yeah.
*  Well, it's crazy.
*  It's absolutely crazy that they do that
*  and look at those little tiny shoes that she's wearing.
*  I mean, it is absolutely crazy,
*  but it's almost crazier what they used to do to heads.
*  Like in ancient cultures where they would flatten heads out
*  to make them look like aliens and stretch them out.
*  Ever seen any of that?
*  While they were alive?
*  Yeah, when they were young.
*  They would take babies.
*  And while the children were young,
*  and this is a really freaky thing,
*  when they started finding these skulls,
*  they're like, what are we looking at?
*  Are these aliens?
*  They were trying to figure it out
*  because your skull is a lot more pliable than you think,
*  especially when you're young.
*  Yeah, the baby is really soft.
*  So they developed this thing
*  where they would put planks on the side of the kid's head
*  and fucking clamp it down
*  and they would stretch their head out like an alien.
*  Because it's like nobility to have a large skull or something.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I think it's, I don't know.
*  When Africa, they put those weighted rings
*  around the woman's neck
*  and then it looks like their neck is really long,
*  but really they just compress their shoulders down.
*  Yeah.
*  And they have like.
*  And it's super bad for the neck.
*  When you take that shit off, your head's gonna fall off.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  That's holding your head up now.
*  For sure.
*  They probably snore terrible too, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Those rings.
*  Mm.
*  You got anything for me?
*  Yeah.
*  The article said that the reason why they did that
*  was similar to the reason Victorian women
*  would do the waist stuff.
*  It was like a status symbol.
*  So like three inches was the best for feet.
*  Four inches was a little better.
*  Five inches and above was like ah.
*  Look at that waist.
*  That's so gross.
*  Ugh.
*  And there wasn't there another time,
*  I think it maybe was before this,
*  where like being fat was like a sign of nobility
*  or whatever. Yeah, man.
*  So like if you were a fat,
*  you were like a fat chicks were the thing
*  because it showed you had money.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  When I was in Thailand,
*  the guys would always wear like white,
*  white powder all over their face,
*  like bleaching powder,
*  because if you were too tanned
*  then it showed that you were like a worker
*  and you worked outside.
*  So everybody would always try to bleach their skin white.
*  It's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, that's dark.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  They would always have like an umbrella.
*  They didn't want sun.
*  They like hiding from the sun all the time.
*  They didn't want to get too dark.
*  Nurse Rachel, Filipino lady,
*  she was explaining that to us.
*  That's one of the reasons why people like glutathione.
*  Glutathione apparently can make your skin lighter
*  in some doses.
*  What else is glutathione for?
*  Glutathione is something that helps you recover from alcohol.
*  It helps your body process alcohol a little bit better.
*  It's got a bunch of functions.
*  I'm the wrong person to ask.
*  It's real good for you.
*  You want a liposomal glutathione.
*  It's the best in terms of like,
*  unless you get IV,
*  but you could take it as a supplement.
*  But it's good for,
*  it actually helps you get over hangovers and shit.
*  Doesn't completely do it,
*  but it gives you like a little extra boost.
*  So you get like the hotel room IV in Vegas.
*  That's what they're giving you.
*  They're giving you glutathione if you ask for it.
*  Yeah, you should ask for it.
*  If you want to get one of them hotel IV jammies.
*  Jamie and I get one once a week.
*  Yeah, we get IV vitamin drip and we get an NAD.
*  It's NAD. NAD.
*  Oh, here we go.
*  Fuck that.
*  You think I fucked up that Gregorio Gavs name up.
*  Let me fuck up NAD for you.
*  What does it do? What is it for?
*  It actually helps keep you younger.
*  It also keeps your body performing younger
*  and maybe even lengthens your telomeres.
*  Telomeres which are an indication
*  or an indicator of your age as your telomeres get,
*  as you get older, they get smaller, they get shorter.
*  And this stuff apparently can somehow or another lengthen it.
*  NAD has two general sets of reactions in the human body.
*  What does NAD stand for?
*  Does it say what it stands for?
*  It means something.
*  It's like short for, what does it say?
*  What's that picture right there, yeah.
*  It doesn't say it on that.
*  It doesn't?
*  Does it break down what those things are for?
*  I know it means something.
*  It has a name.
*  Can you Google what does NAD mean?
*  Oh, there it is.
*  Nicotinamide andanine dinucleotide.
*  That was pretty good.
*  I'm tired though now.
*  You read that way better than I would.
*  I used my monkey brain and now I'm tired.
*  Helps turning nutrients into energy
*  as a key player in metabolism
*  and working as a helper molecule
*  for proteins that regulate other cellular functions.
*  This is like a normal thing that lots of people have
*  or this is like a special Joe Rogan secret sauce?
*  You can get it.
*  They sell it.
*  People can get it.
*  It's not cheap, but it's very good for you.
*  You feel great.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just, I'm getting old
*  and I'm willing to try anything.
*  When you're like 52 and you still like working out,
*  you're like, okay, what do I have to do?
*  What else you gotta do?
*  What do I have to do?
*  What's the new do?
*  Yeah, and I'm only willing to do so much
*  because if they're like, well, you gotta drink water
*  and no more alcohol forever, I'm like, huh.
*  Or, or what's the other option?
*  I live less, but I enjoy it more.
*  You drink a little more water
*  and you can still drink alcohol.
*  I have a complex life.
*  I need a little booze every now and then.
*  I really do.
*  I need a break.
*  I need a break.
*  I need a break from responsibilities.
*  I need a break from anxiety.
*  I need a break from just thinking,
*  from people's opinions, from war, from chaos, from arguments.
*  I mean, it's crazy times right now.
*  If I didn't, couldn't just smoke a joint, drink a beer
*  and let it all sink in.
*  The people that don't are fascinating.
*  Like, what are you doing with all that?
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  How?
*  You know what I really.
*  Enlighten me.
*  What are you doing?
*  Started getting into.
*  I've got something here.
*  I've got something here.
*  What do you got there, Joseph?
*  This book that I've been reading.
*  It's called Breath.
*  It's by this guy, James Nestor.
*  Fascinating shit on the importance of breathing exercises.
*  Really fascinating.
*  Really fascinating.
*  Breathing exercises for what?
*  For all sorts of things.
*  Well, you know, it's one of the things
*  that Wim Hof has always said about breathing exercises,
*  that you actually can enhance your immune system.
*  Thank you, sir.
*  Regulate your metabolism.
*  This guy's an upcoming guest,
*  so I just got into it last night.
*  But I'm fucking loving it.
*  What'd you read about me before I came on?
*  I didn't read that you had a boxing career.
*  Oh, there you go.
*  I know you, man.
*  I don't have to read about you.
*  It only took us five podcasts to get there.
*  I know, right?
*  I knew about your fights.
*  I'm pushing for the record.
*  Are you able to fully train right now?
*  Like, what is the rules?
*  Not really, you know?
*  Not really, right?
*  My gym just opened back up.
*  Does everybody have to distance?
*  Is like, hit a bag six feet apart from each other?
*  I think if you probably came in with a measuring tape,
*  90% of the time we are within that.
*  My gym is about 7,000 square feet,
*  and the average class is about 12 people in it.
*  Okay, so you got a nice piece of property there.
*  And we have a huge roll-up door,
*  so it's almost open air with the fans going and stuff.
*  But we take everybody's temperature before they come in.
*  And we're not actually sparring or anything like that.
*  Yeah, a lot of gyms are starting to open up now
*  and just kickboxing or shadowboxing and hitting the bag,
*  things along those lines.
*  But it's been great for me getting back,
*  because I was starting to lose it there,
*  I think, sometimes.
*  I'm stuck at home.
*  Were you working out at home?
*  I built a home gym, and I was doing my thing,
*  and I was trying to run and stuff,
*  but it's just not the same.
*  And then the students start coming back.
*  You don't see how bad they were when they came back mentally,
*  but you see over the course of a week or two
*  of them working out every day,
*  how much more they open up,
*  how much more normal they seem,
*  how much happier they are.
*  And then they start letting the hat out of the bag,
*  like, man, I was in a dark spot.
*  And it's like, I've been having an absolute blast.
*  I teach, we have four classes a day,
*  I'm teaching all the classes right now.
*  I'm loving it.
*  That's beautiful.
*  I'm happy to hear that,
*  and I'm happy to hear you're able to open again.
*  I think that's awesome.
*  That dark shit is no joke, man.
*  It's no joke.
*  Depression is a real fucking thing.
*  It's a big part of why people are so angry right now.
*  Because there's a lot of people out there
*  that maybe they do spin,
*  or maybe they do whatever the fuck they've been doing.
*  They can't do it right now.
*  They can't do any of it.
*  And there's so many people
*  that are losing their livelihood.
*  I think there's a lot of people
*  that live corporate life or have normal jobs,
*  and I'm not talking shit about that.
*  But put yourself in someone's shoe
*  that they invested everything they owned,
*  everything they had,
*  they put in all their work following this American dream,
*  this dream, this whatever dream.
*  And for 14 years, 15 years, they invest everything in,
*  and then this weird flu comes along,
*  and they can't do their business anymore.
*  Through no fault of their own.
*  Through no fault of their own.
*  And it's like, well, they should have had some money
*  pushed aside or saved aside or whatever.
*  How come these giant, these airplane companies
*  that have been making billions of dollars
*  for years and years on end,
*  they get to bail out?
*  They get to bail out.
*  But Lolita's fucking whatever.
*  Fuck. Well, the dirty secret is,
*  if they don't bail out the airlines,
*  the airlines are not gonna employ all those people,
*  and then everyone's fucked even further.
*  So they look at that like this is something we need,
*  because we need it for business,
*  we need it for people to be able to travel around,
*  we need these planes running,
*  we're not gonna be able to do it ourselves.
*  But the dirty secret is there's not enough money
*  to fix everything.
*  There's not enough money to pay all the people,
*  all the money they were making during the time off.
*  And then my shout out to my boy John Thomas in Ohio,
*  my buddy I went to high school with back in Ohio,
*  he has a couple of pizzerias,
*  and I think they're allowed to open back up now,
*  but his employees, a lot of his employees
*  aren't coming back to work because they make more money
*  on unemployment than they ever did before.
*  They have an excuse.
*  If they make more money on unemployment
*  than they were actually earning working there,
*  and they don't have to go back to work
*  because they could say they're scared of COVID.
*  Fuck.
*  Listen, I get it.
*  If I was one of those dudes, I'd be like,
*  hey man, I don't wanna die from cooking pizza, bitch.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I don't wanna get a, especially if you're a fat guy,
*  and you're like, I could just hang out at home
*  and play Call of Duty and get paid more?
*  Or risk my life to make pizza?
*  Fuck outta here.
*  I still just can't wrap my brain around people still
*  buying into all this shit.
*  It is the fucking flu.
*  People die of the flu every year.
*  A lot of them die of the flu.
*  Our friend, our friend, Eve Edwards, was sick as fuck.
*  Was sick for like weeks at a time in and out of the hospital.
*  This was back in like December.
*  Now you're either telling me that COVID-19
*  was here before that, or it's the flu.
*  But now when you get, now it's COVID-19,
*  but then it was the flu.
*  My other friend was super sick.
*  Well they can test it, they test his antibodies though.
*  They test, that's how they find out.
*  They do an antibody test.
*  And then they say, oh, you did have COVID-19.
*  But, like I had a buddy of mine who came in here
*  who was fucking convinced.
*  He's like, I know I had it.
*  I was so sick, nothing, nothing.
*  He was like, what?
*  Or maybe a bad test.
*  He spread it to the other one.
*  Did you see the, I'm going ham on this.
*  Did you see the guy in Tanzania?
*  It's like the president of Tanzania.
*  No, what did he do?
*  Oh, it's so good.
*  Jamie, you should look this up.
*  What did he do?
*  It's probably too long.
*  He's like the president of Tanzania in like Africa, right?
*  And it's got like super thick accent.
*  And he said, you know, something's going on here people.
*  They sent us the COVID tests.
*  And we tested, we took 10 tests or however many tests.
*  And I took the dragon fruit and we tested the inside
*  of the dragon fruit and we wrote Charles whatever.
*  And we tested it off and it was inconclusive.
*  And we took a goat and I tested the goat
*  and I wrote his name was Sandra.
*  And she's 30 years old and works whatever.
*  And we tested her and she was positive.
*  And then I did another one with a chicken
*  and it came back positive.
*  And then another one with whatever.
*  And he tested all this random stupid shit
*  and got like positive, positive, inconclusive.
*  Well, inconclusive makes sense if you're testing fruit.
*  And positive might make sense
*  if it's really contagious to animals.
*  If you're in an area that has a high concentration
*  of people that have the disease.
*  Or you just think it's just totally a scam.
*  It's a fucking scratch ticket.
*  There's no way, guys, stop buying this bullshit.
*  This is bullshit.
*  You just think it's,
*  what do you think those people are dying of?
*  Is this another cold?
*  I think it's a real bad flu and it's flu season.
*  And people are getting sick.
*  But COVID-19, the thing is a real thing.
*  I know it's a real thing.
*  Okay.
*  I know that's a real thing.
*  So you know these people are dying in a way
*  that's not consistent with dying from the flu, right?
*  Some of them are dying in real weird ways.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Maybe.
*  It's real.
*  It's real.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  It's real.
*  You're fucking around in a little bit of a way.
*  I'm a little bit fucking around and I'm a little bit.
*  But you're a little bit like,
*  this is not that much different from the flu
*  that we should have killed our society.
*  We killed the world's whole economy.
*  Yeah.
*  The fucking whole world over a thing
*  that kills less than 1% of people.
*  Right.
*  And how do we get it back?
*  How do we get the world back?
*  How do we get it back to normal?
*  No one knows.
*  There's no roadmap. No clue.
*  No one. No clue.
*  And here's the thing though.
*  This is one thing in support of those
*  hardcore business folks.
*  They're the ones who want this shit back to normal
*  more than anybody.
*  Right?
*  They're in like deep shit right now.
*  That's why the economy's still doing so well.
*  They, it shows you how bullshit the economy is.
*  The stock market is doing great.
*  The stock market, there's days where the stock market's up.
*  I'm like, how?
*  Well, show me your math.
*  How is your stock market up?
*  There's so much fuckery going on.
*  And then it's like, we're supposed to trust the who.
*  Right?
*  And the who says one thing and then the next day
*  Well, first of all, let's call it the world health
*  organization because the who is awesome.
*  Right, right.
*  You know?
*  Who are you?
*  Who, who, who, who?
*  Come on man, I'm a child of the 80s.
*  The who is, they were kings.
*  The world health organization, Fauci.
*  Yes.
*  Those people.
*  Well, the saddest one was when he said that
*  the only reason we told people not to wear masks
*  is because we didn't have any.
*  Well, and the other shit was,
*  how about the time we told them,
*  well then like a week later or a week after
*  or before, he's like, oh well you know,
*  masks don't actually work but it just shows solidarity
*  and it's a sign that we should do this.
*  And I'm like, what?
*  And then the other chick does 90% of,
*  or half of all positive tests are false positives.
*  Dude, so much.
*  And this is normal, like it's so much fuckery going on.
*  So much fuckery, but.
*  So much fuckery going on.
*  It's also they're learning on the job.
*  You know, they're trying to figure out what this thing is
*  and isn't on the job.
*  And they can't just be honest, you know,
*  and say they, you know, we made mistakes.
*  This is what we thought.
*  Now we think differently.
*  But people died, sorry.
*  You know, they can't say that.
*  People died in nursing homes
*  that our government made them take sick people,
*  whether it was the flu or whatever.
*  Not government, New York, right?
*  New York, that's a dark choice, man.
*  And then Como's brother is on CNN,
*  like I'm locking myself in my basement for 15 days
*  and he gets caught.
*  Come on, your whole family, bro.
*  Well, not only did he get caught,
*  but he also did a video of him coming out of the basement
*  for the first time.
*  Yeah, that was the worst thing of getting caught.
*  That was like you planted and made this fake scenario
*  and your family's supposed to be all shocked
*  when you come out of the basement for the first time
*  in 14 days.
*  Fuck off.
*  I agree with you, fuck off.
*  That said, I've worked in television
*  and I guarantee you that was a producer's decision.
*  That was some network executive that wanted a video
*  of him coming out and they had already got it planned
*  and he just fucking jetted over to the Hamptons,
*  check out a spot where he's gonna build his dope house
*  and then came back and was like, okay, we're doing it.
*  I'm coming out of the basement, everybody knows.
*  I got in a fight with a guy on a bike.
*  Is that okay still?
*  Don't call me Fredo.
*  And so he goes up the stairs like, here I am,
*  look at this, I made it out of the basement.
*  I feel for him in that situation.
*  I feel for him because I guarantee you
*  that was some jackass from the network
*  that had this idea to have him come out of the basement
*  in some sort of theatrical thing.
*  You were just deceitful or sneaky or whatever word it is
*  to all of the viewers on TV.
*  I don't feel bad for him.
*  You intentionally just tricked everybody on some fake shit.
*  They didn't have to do that.
*  They didn't have to do that.
*  Well, that's why podcasts work
*  because nobody's doing that kind of shit on podcasts.
*  They realize you don't have to.
*  You don't have to pretend.
*  Just say, yeah, I went to the Hamptons.
*  Probably shouldn't, but I stayed away from everybody.
*  My wife's already around me anyway.
*  And then some dude on the bike just came by
*  and he was being a dick.
*  I was like, yeah, bro, just looking at my house spot.
*  I'm building a dope house, you bike riding dick fuck.
*  If I survive this fake COVID shit,
*  I'm gonna fucking live right next door to you.
*  He was an interesting case too.
*  Apparently he was saying at nighttime it gets really bad,
*  but when he was on television, he looked great.
*  Like, yeah, but it's bad at night.
*  Okay, how about you go to bed earlier?
*  We don't really have it, but it's part of our thing.
*  Are you taking vitamins?
*  How come nobody said that, right?
*  Bro, how come that?
*  We closed down gyms.
*  Nobody has talked about food, about the immune system.
*  None of that.
*  That Dr. Shiva guy was saying a lot of cool stuff,
*  but nobody's saying it, so it must be
*  some weird going on there, I don't know.
*  Yeah, he's a weird one.
*  I don't know if he's telling the truth
*  or what the deal is.
*  I started like some of the stuff's not gonna make sense,
*  and then it was like you're obviously running
*  for some sort of office or whatever.
*  Very smart, that's for sure.
*  Very intelligent guy.
*  If you're a person that questions any aspect of COVID,
*  you're immediately pushed into this area
*  of someone who can't be trusted, can't listen to them,
*  gotta silence them.
*  You're a conspiracy theorist.
*  Dude, they were saying that about Elon.
*  The Elon podcast never trended,
*  I'm not asking, I don't give a fuck.
*  Like, if it trends, if it doesn't,
*  I appreciate YouTube, I appreciate this platform.
*  I really do, I really do.
*  But I think when something gets 11 million downloads
*  in a day, and there's a bunch of other videos
*  that don't get nearly as much, but that one's not trending.
*  Like, why isn't it trending?
*  And how much that has to do with his opinions on things
*  that aren't sanctioned.
*  And one of his opinions on things was the perspective
*  on COVID, that keeping people locked up
*  as a mandatory thing, that is not good.
*  It's not what this country was founded on,
*  and we should quarantine people who are sick.
*  And he's smart as fuck, and he made a lot of sense.
*  And people don't wanna hear that,
*  because they wanna hear Fauci tell you,
*  wear a mask or don't wear a mask.
*  I mean, these people are health experts,
*  but we've proven that they've been wrong
*  about multiple things.
*  Just in the two months they have been wrong,
*  and they have proven that they've been wrong
*  in multiple things, continuously.
*  Right, but if you have a video with Fauci,
*  and it gets 11 million views,
*  that motherfucker will trend, guarantee.
*  I guarantee you.
*  You can't do that, you shouldn't do that.
*  I shouldn't say you can't do that,
*  because you obviously can and you did.
*  But you shouldn't do that, because it's not good.
*  The best way to figure out who's right,
*  when someone who, especially in retrospect,
*  hindsight's 20-20, but we're looking back three months
*  at all the times that things were wrong,
*  all the mistakes that were made.
*  In January, the World Health Organization
*  literally said it can't be transmitted
*  from person to person according to China.
*  That's what they literally said.
*  They put it out on a tweet, okay?
*  Give them that, everybody made mistakes.
*  But because of that, you can't silence people
*  who have contrary opinions.
*  Because of the fact that you have all these people
*  that are experts in their field that have made mistakes,
*  you cannot discount someone who's clearly
*  a fucking super genius, who's also looking at this
*  from an additional perspective.
*  Here's another perspective.
*  Why don't we just quarantine the people that are at risk?
*  Why don't we quarantine people who are overweight,
*  instead of the whole population?
*  Then, step two, let's figure out what the fuck this is
*  and how to take care of it and take care of everybody.
*  But give people the opportunity,
*  if they choose to take a risk, to take the risk.
*  You can't force them to tank their business.
*  I mean, maybe the hindsight's 20-20,
*  but that sounds like a logical thing
*  that should have been said from the jump.
*  Why do we have to make that huge mistake?
*  This is why, because we thought it was gonna be way worse.
*  We thought it was gonna be worse than it is.
*  We thought it was gonna burn through the population
*  and kill 10% of everyone.
*  Sometimes those things happen,
*  and sometimes they morph, right?
*  They evolve.
*  Viruses can change.
*  They can change as they're going from person to person,
*  and they really believe that the virus
*  that we got on the West Coast here is actually lighter
*  than the virus they got on the East Coast.
*  They think the virus that came from Europe
*  is probably more deadly than the virus that came here.
*  Why? I don't know.
*  But there's a bunch of other factors
*  that they never take into consideration.
*  You never hear people talking about vitamin D,
*  going outside, taking care of yourself.
*  Those people on the other side, man,
*  those people on the West Coast, the East Coast, rather,
*  they don't get any sun.
*  Do you ever live in New York?
*  Bro.
*  Been there, though, but yeah, I get that.
*  It gets dreary.
*  They're just right on top of each other.
*  Every subway, everything.
*  Think about the subway rail when you walk up the stairs.
*  Oh, gross.
*  And also in those subways,
*  everybody's breathing everybody else's air.
*  There's no way around it.
*  You have to breathe their air.
*  But the big thing, I lived in Boston.
*  I lived in Newton when I was a kid.
*  And I remember Newton was a nice place,
*  beautiful, beautiful neighborhood.
*  But I remember the wintertime was so depressing.
*  Just look up at the sky and it was just gray.
*  You couldn't see anything.
*  You couldn't see any sun.
*  The sun came through the clouds,
*  but you never saw a blue sky.
*  For months at a time, it was just gray.
*  And everybody would get bummed out
*  and people would get real shitty with each other.
*  Did you notice when the quarantine first happened,
*  the first two weeks, it was just draining all day every day.
*  My backyard was flooding.
*  It was terrible.
*  And life was awful.
*  And then all of a sudden the sun came out
*  and it was like, a couple days off, it's not too bad, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, having a day off and it's raining sucks.
*  Awful.
*  Yeah.
*  Awful.
*  It's not that bad for us because at least we can say,
*  oh, we need this rain.
*  This is a good rest day.
*  We need this rain.
*  We're in a drought right now.
*  It's real bad.
*  But if you live in Seattle, bro.
*  Every day.
*  Seattle, I love you people.
*  You guys are beautiful.
*  I love your attitude.
*  I don't like the Chaz situation.
*  I don't think that's wise.
*  But.
*  What's your thoughts on Chaz?
*  I just want to tell the people of Seattle, get out.
*  Go.
*  Just go.
*  There's a reason why it's going crazy.
*  It's filled with homeless people.
*  Everyone's tired, they're depressed.
*  You don't get any sunlight.
*  It's not good.
*  You need sunlight.
*  That shit's terrible for you.
*  My take on the Chaz situation is,
*  they're doing exact,
*  I was talking about it with Colleen Noir the other day.
*  They're doing exactly the same thing they get mad at
*  when they think about a country.
*  They put up walls.
*  They have borders.
*  They have police and enforcement.
*  They beat the fuck out of people.
*  There's been murders inside.
*  It's not all kumbaya.
*  You know?
*  It's like, you just made a shittier,
*  smaller version of a city.
*  Of course you did.
*  Of course you did.
*  But it's got borders.
*  A regular city, you can just drive in at Albuquerque.
*  They let you in.
*  Chaz is like, fuck you.
*  We got border walls.
*  You can go to San Francisco, you just drive in.
*  No one can come in here if we have a plastic barrier.
*  How crazy is that?
*  How did that happen?
*  They're LARPing.
*  How did that happen?
*  It's live action role playing.
*  It's what it is.
*  For sure.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.
*  And they took over the city?
*  They took over the LARPers?
*  Well, they need to learn.
*  You know, I mean, there's a thing that happens
*  when a lot of these protesters get equated with progress.
*  Right?
*  Whether it's Antifa or any like, you know,
*  real Marxist left wing progressive socialist movement.
*  They have good intentions, right?
*  And they get lumped in with the idea of progress.
*  So people let them get away with stuff.
*  They can go, oh, just, it's progress.
*  It's gonna work out.
*  It's gonna work out.
*  But they don't have a real plan.
*  These folks don't have a long-term plan.
*  When Seattle gave them that, just back,
*  it's probably the most brilliant move ever.
*  Like, okay, oh, you think you can do better?
*  Why don't you go ahead?
*  It's like, you have kids, right?
*  When your kid's like, oh, no one to tie my shoes.
*  Like, okay, go tie your shoes.
*  And you stand there for a minute.
*  You want some help?
*  I'll help you, because you don't know how to tie your shoes.
*  This is how you do it.
*  You make the bunny ears.
*  You go to the loop.
*  But sometimes you have to let a kid,
*  I bet particularly boys, I have all girls,
*  but I would imagine with boys, even more so.
*  They get a little stubborn.
*  I fucking know what I'm doing, dad.
*  And you gotta go, oh, okay, do you?
*  Okay, Chaz, good luck.
*  Good luck.
*  Okay, Chaz.
*  After six blocks.
*  You guys had two murders inside of a fucking week.
*  I just don't understand how that happened.
*  I don't understand how the city just let it go.
*  I think it's like a publicity stunt.
*  I think the city or whoever's in charge of that
*  are letting them do it.
*  But they're not being overrun with guns and bombs
*  and bullshit.
*  This is like, we're gonna let these guys have it
*  and then we're gonna let this fail.
*  I don't even know.
*  It just doesn't make any sense to me.
*  It seems like a joke.
*  If you talk to people, my friend Rob Wolf reached out to me
*  because some folks from the Seattle Police Department
*  reached out to him.
*  They're trying to get their message out.
*  They're trying to figure it out.
*  And essentially they were saying
*  that the media's not telling the true story.
*  And that the true story is every time,
*  like the media will show them tear gassing people.
*  They don't say that they had set up boundaries
*  and they said, you gotta stay out of the precinct,
*  you gotta stay out of this area.
*  You guys, you can't just invade.
*  And every time they put up these boundaries,
*  they would push through and then they had to use tear gas,
*  they felt, to defend their position.
*  And then they eventually had to give up the whole precinct.
*  Then they had to give up like six blocks.
*  And they don't feel like there's a lot of support
*  for their position in the news.
*  And they also don't feel like they're being given
*  the freedom to defend it properly.
*  Like they really, they couldn't,
*  they had to get out of there.
*  That's why they took, that's why those people took it.
*  That's why it's still locked down today.
*  And the mayor has been saying lately,
*  it's time to go home now.
*  But the mayor before gave a fucked up answer of it,
*  like saying that peaceful protest has always been great.
*  Maybe this is the summer of love.
*  Like, oh, okay, good luck lady.
*  Like these ideas, they get connected with progress, right?
*  So those people who really want better, right?
*  They're angry that George Floyd got murdered,
*  but we all are.
*  Every normal rational person's angry.
*  They all wanna fucking see change, but we all do.
*  But they decided to see change in six blocks of Seattle
*  that had nothing to do with George Floyd.
*  They just took over.
*  And they took over these buildings.
*  So they basically did what Columbus did.
*  They came and took over an area,
*  but then they did what Trump did.
*  They put up a wall.
*  And then they did what those cops did.
*  They beat the fuck out of people.
*  I mean, they ruined their own idea
*  within a couple of weeks.
*  So it really was like Seattle just going, go ahead.
*  Oh, you know how to do better?
*  Oh, you're gonna do better?
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  Go ahead.
*  And now they're like, it's time to go home.
*  But there's people in there that are armed.
*  It's not that simple.
*  I don't know how they think
*  they're gonna get these people out of there.
*  Cause you can't even get homeless people
*  out of San Francisco.
*  They've basically taken over Portland.
*  Portland's filled with tents.
*  San Francisco's nuts, man.
*  It's nuts.
*  You drive down the street
*  and you stomp some neighborhoods in San Francisco.
*  You see like multi-million dollar houses
*  and there's five tents in front of the house.
*  They're like, what is this?
*  You can't litter.
*  You can't throw beer cans on the ground.
*  How come you can leave a tent
*  and a fucking little camp stove
*  and a cardboard box filled with bullshit?
*  And then everybody's just waiting for somebody else
*  to come clean the tent out in front of their yard.
*  Everybody's waiting to fix a solution.
*  Joe, what would you do if there was three tents
*  in front of your house?
*  It's a good question.
*  I don't know what to do.
*  I don't wanna go to jail.
*  I don't wanna go to jail, so I don't know.
*  Probably hire somebody to clean it up.
*  I don't know what to do.
*  I wouldn't know what to do.
*  What is the law?
*  Can my kid not play in the yard?
*  Because someone threw a fucking heroin needle in the yard
*  and he's got a tent right there.
*  And if you're in Venice
*  and you got this little tiny patch of grass
*  where your kid can play
*  and your kid runs into a heroin needle
*  that someone chucked over the fence.
*  But we have to be progressive.
*  We have to be nice.
*  And people equate.
*  No, bro, you go knock on the tent.
*  Hey man, you can't have your tent here.
*  Get the fuck out.
*  I'll fucking do what I want, bro.
*  No, no, I actually won't.
*  You're gonna get the fuck out.
*  You're gonna get the fuck out.
*  Nope, gotta go.
*  I'm a crack baby.
*  All right, later.
*  You gotta go.
*  I'm looking at the Seattle news.
*  And I'm out leaving.
*  They said they're gonna leave today.
*  There's like an official capital
*  They're gonna have food.
*  protests zone says it's concluded as of tonight
*  and they expect some people to not actually leave,
*  but they're saying it's over.
*  See, I think somebody else funded that.
*  I think that was a big joke.
*  That was like a big thing.
*  Who do you think funded it?
*  I don't know, probably somebody in a deep state
*  or whatever.
*  The guys that fund all the other stuff
*  take those crazy, right?
*  The guys who throw Epstein witnesses out of buildings.
*  How does that money go around?
*  Who gets it?
*  It goes in Bitcoin.
*  They buy tacos with it.
*  I don't know.
*  But I think people are funding it.
*  And I don't know, there's so much shit going on
*  that I can't just blindly believe
*  any of these narratives anymore.
*  It's just beyond to me.
*  It would be crazy if we found out
*  there was some sort of a weird ulterior motive
*  for letting them take over
*  and that this has all been planned out
*  in some sort of a strange way.
*  People think, some people think that this civil unrest
*  and that even encouraging the spread of corona
*  would, by letting people protest
*  and not doing anything to stop it,
*  is actually some sort of a nefarious attempt
*  to make sure that all the elections are mail-in ballots
*  so they can monkey with them.
*  Ooh, shenanigans.
*  It does make sense if I was writing a Tom Clancy novel.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  That makes sense.
*  I don't know if it's true though.
*  Dude, I can barely pay attention to the shit I do.
*  My left switch kick's terrible.
*  So much fat in it.
*  I got you, bro.
*  Moves too slow.
*  I got you, bro.
*  Too much of a weird, come off balance.
*  I'm concentrating on that.
*  I can't be concentrating on Chaz.
*  I like the step up over the switch.
*  We can work on that.
*  I'll tell you what, I'll show you that.
*  Why do you like the step up over the switch?
*  Okay.
*  Because if we do the switch kick,
*  you're staring at me, scary time.
*  I'm staring at you, we're about to fucking whatever.
*  And then you see me jump and switch my feet.
*  You know that something's coming.
*  You know it's coming.
*  But if I just step forward with my right foot,
*  even if you tried to back up,
*  I can make the adjustment because my foot is stepping.
*  Mm, okay.
*  That makes sense, that makes sense.
*  Kevin Ross doesn't even switch.
*  But once I jump to switch, I'm stuck in that position.
*  Now I have to take an additional step if you back up.
*  But if I just walk forward and you move backwards,
*  I can adjust my foot.
*  Some guys don't like to switch, right?
*  Some guys just blast it right from the front leg.
*  Yeah, I mean I do that as well.
*  It just depends on the distance.
*  If the person's coming to me, then I can do that.
*  Right, and if they're moving away,
*  if they're moving away, then I walk.
*  Makes sense.
*  What do you think about the low calf kick?
*  Who crazy is that?
*  That's become so popular.
*  It wasn't like a thing, and then all of a sudden
*  it's a thing.
*  It's like the best thing.
*  It's like a really effective thing.
*  My training partner, Bomba, we both had,
*  both of our last fights were on the same card.
*  That was like his thing.
*  He was like, I'm gonna kick him in the calf.
*  I'm gonna kick him in the calf.
*  I'm gonna kick him in the calf.
*  And then he kicked me in the calf while we were sparring.
*  And I'm like, hey bro, like fucking don't do that.
*  Like don't do that.
*  Like stop doing that, you know?
*  My fucking shit hurt.
*  It can ruin your shit.
*  Yeah, it'll really fuck you up.
*  It's not like a thigh kick where you can like
*  catch a medium one and you're okay.
*  If somebody really slams into your calf, you're fucked.
*  And if you, it happens by just being lazy with your block.
*  If you block correctly, it's fine.
*  But if like, especially in like a sparring situation,
*  you're just, you're lazy with your block.
*  And then it hits that side of that calf
*  and it's a different bulging.
*  It fucks it up for a long time too.
*  The nerve, it's a weird feeling, right?
*  Yeah, sucks.
*  It's like, ah!
*  Well then you saw like the Michael Chandler one
*  where his whole foot went numb.
*  That was insane.
*  Henry Cejudo versus Mighty Mouse too.
*  Same thing.
*  The second fight, same thing.
*  Yeah, it shuts your foot off.
*  It's nuts.
*  And there's not much you can do about that.
*  He's a beast, huh?
*  Dude.
*  He's up there too.
*  Undeniable.
*  He's up there.
*  You wanna talk about some of the greats.
*  The guys are Olympic gold medals in wrestling
*  and then two division UFC world champion.
*  And then smashed Dominic Cruz,
*  smashed TJ Dillashaw,
*  smashed Marlon Marais.
*  And then juiced up TJ Dillashaw.
*  Epioed.
*  Epioed.
*  But starving to death.
*  Really, the EPO is just keeping him alive.
*  Bro, he looked worse on weigh-in day
*  than anyone I've ever seen ever.
*  Next to Travis Luter.
*  But Travis Luter was just trying to dehydrate
*  too much in one day.
*  TJ had eaten himself down to nothing.
*  And then dehydrated.
*  And then dehydrated himself.
*  He had eaten himself down to nothing.
*  Like he let his body eat itself.
*  His cheeks were completely sunken in.
*  He looked like he was found in the woods.
*  And that was for 35, right?
*  25. 25.
*  25.
*  Yeah, so he was the 35 pound champion.
*  Went down to 25.
*  He said he took EPO just to be able to train.
*  He was like, he couldn't do anything.
*  But the, you know, it's hard to tell.
*  The Alpha Male guys are like, fuck you, you did.
*  Like Cody Garbrandt in a press conference was saying,
*  bro, you were always taking that shit.
*  So he didn't say anything.
*  And it's like, it's one of those things where it's like,
*  when you get caught with something like that,
*  your whole legacy gets thrown up in the air.
*  People are like. Sure.
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm wondering if they could retroactively
*  test some of the samples.
*  If they kept the samples as long?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know how long they keep them.
*  That's how they got Lance, right?
*  Was it, Lance never popped while he was competing
*  and was after the fact, right?
*  Something like that?
*  I don't know if they ever got him.
*  I think he had to confess.
*  Really?
*  I don't believe they ever caught Lance.
*  I thought they took old samples and then did it.
*  But maybe they didn't catch him.
*  You might be right.
*  I don't know, I could be wrong.
*  You might be right.
*  I felt like at the time when he quit though,
*  that wasn't the case.
*  I felt at the time when he, it was like,
*  the walls were closing in on him
*  and he had ex teammates testify.
*  Yeah, everybody was going at him.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy.
*  But again, it's just, when your whole sport's dirty,
*  like what are they doing now?
*  Are they just remarkably slower?
*  Like what are they doing?
*  You got a juiced up sport.
*  If you keep the same times, I'm gonna be super suspicious.
*  Yeah, what happened in that very next,
*  the very next, especially if the next guy behind Lance
*  that didn't juice was 27th or something.
*  Did the numbers just tack on an hour to every race?
*  I know, I thought it was 18th, but you might be right.
*  But it's something crazy like that.
*  It's definitely top 10 or gone.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Top 15.
*  We'll agree it's over top 15.
*  Yeah, well that's the old days of the UFC too.
*  I mean, you wanna go back to the old days of pride for sure.
*  Ensign Inouye told me they told him on the contract,
*  you will not be tested for steroids.
*  He said it was all in my-
*  I think Eve told me that too.
*  Same thing.
*  It was on big bold letters, like it will not be tested.
*  Big bold letters, they're like, how about it boys?
*  And I think so could you.
*  I wanna say it was so could you.
*  I could be wrong.
*  One of those guys told me that after they got tested
*  in pride, they would walk out.
*  If they got tested, that there would be just cups of piss
*  all down the hallway after the fight.
*  They didn't do anything with it.
*  The guys peed in the cup and they set it on the floor.
*  And down the hallway was just cups of pee all the way down.
*  Yeah, pee in this cup please, it's required.
*  Okay, thanks, yeah we got it.
*  For nothing.
*  Yeah, we tested for drugs, man.
*  Tested their piss, it just burned the results.
*  Clean as a whistle.
*  When you go and watch those, some of those fights
*  where guys were just so juiced up,
*  they let Bob Sapp fight at 375 pounds with abs.
*  With abs, bro.
*  That guy, and then Andy's like an emotional wreck,
*  starts crying whenever.
*  Well, when you're on that kind of juice,
*  I would imagine your whole perspective on reality
*  just gets thrown into the corner.
*  What kind of doses are those?
*  There's just buckets of testosterone in every week.
*  I wonder if he'd be clean, he would tell you.
*  What were you doing during the Minotauro fight?
*  Tell me about those days.
*  Tell me about what was going on.
*  Cro Cop and his legs were just fucking enormous.
*  Meanwhile, Cro Cop smashed him.
*  Even when he was fully on the shit,
*  Cro Cop dropped him straight left.
*  All those guys were on the shit.
*  Yeah, probably Cro Cop too.
*  For sure.
*  Well, that was the thing,
*  people got real mad at me when I questioned Fador.
*  I'm like, well, listen, it's not like Russia
*  hasn't been known to do shit like that before.
*  It's not exactly.
*  When it's in your contract that you're not testing
*  and you're the goat heavyweight.
*  You're the goat.
*  Then you come to the US, maybe not so much the goat anymore.
*  Yeah, not so much the goat anymore
*  once they were testing, right?
*  Vanilla, same thing.
*  But also years on the clock.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  For sure, of course.
*  You know, when he was fighting Cro Cop,
*  the early days of Fador versus Cro Cop,
*  it's hard to argue that he wasn't a goat.
*  He's one of those guys in the heavyweight division.
*  There was a few years when Randleman picked him up
*  and slammed him and then he comored him right afterwards.
*  Insane.
*  Yeah, there were some fights, man,
*  when you go like, that guy's the best.
*  He's the fucking best.
*  Randleman used to be a terrifying dude too.
*  Oh my God.
*  Remember he'd jump up and down across some cage.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  This dude's a gorilla.
*  He had so much athleticism.
*  He was so fast and so powerful.
*  He knocked out Cro Cop.
*  Remember that?
*  Left hook.
*  Stepped in, faked like a takedown,
*  cracked him with a left hook, boom!
*  And then finished him off on the ground
*  with nasty hammer fist.
*  It was horrible.
*  I mean, that's like the kickboxer transitioning
*  to MMA's biggest problem, right?
*  Yep.
*  Faked the takedown, hands down.
*  Yep.
*  Been a lot of those.
*  Yep, there's been quite a few of those.
*  And Randleman was like, he was so perfect for that role
*  because he was the wrestler who was a stud wrestler
*  but also had crazy speed and power with his punches.
*  Crazy closing the distance power.
*  Like Woodley.
*  Exactly.
*  Go like the Woodley-Jay Heron fight, or Carlos Conti.
*  Or the Woodley and Robbie Loller fight.
*  Oh yeah, perfect example.
*  His ability to close distance and hit the target
*  is second to none.
*  Oh my God, yeah.
*  He would throw bombs, man.
*  What a fucking career that guy had.
*  Has had.
*  But how good did Gilbert Burns look, man?
*  That was crazy.
*  I'm a big fan of Gilbert Burns.
*  He's a stud.
*  Well, before the fight I was like,
*  man, I really like Woodley, but I think Gilbert Burns.
*  And everybody's like, no, Woodley for sure.
*  Woodley for sure.
*  If you see the Gilbert Burns that knocked out Damien Maia
*  and you realize like, man, this guy is no joke on the ground.
*  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu world champion
*  and he's got that sneaky left hook.
*  Also, this is a giant opportunity for him.
*  Woodley's an all-time great.
*  If Woodley retires right now,
*  he goes down the books, won the all-time great UFC champions.
*  Definitely top three welterweights of all time.
*  Or top four.
*  Plus there's a big difference in a former champion
*  and an up-and-coming guy that's starting to see the light
*  that there is a fucking title right there.
*  I can get to this.
*  I've been in those positions.
*  That dude's a dangerous dude
*  when they haven't gotten there yet.
*  This is a guy that's still trying to keep it.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And then that's Burns.
*  That team Sanford MMA with Henry Hooft.
*  Woo!
*  They're killing it.
*  He's got a Jiu-Jitsu monster, Phenom,
*  and he's working with high-level strikers every day.
*  What's crazy is like...
*  And Gilbert Burns is on a kill streak.
*  Oh, man, he's such on a kill streak.
*  What's crazy is like, he really didn't strike
*  until like just a few years ago.
*  I mean, I don't know how many years he's been fighting now,
*  but before that, like just had to learn how to strike.
*  He was a Jiu-Jitsu guy.
*  He doesn't have like a background in kickboxing,
*  but when you watch him fight, he's all about striking.
*  Really good.
*  Really good.
*  Really good.
*  Dude, did him drop Woodley like that in the first round
*  and swarm him?
*  Like, fuck, man.
*  And his pace, keeps up that pace
*  for five fucking rounds, hard.
*  Well, then like between UFC fights,
*  he's doing grappling, still competing
*  at high-level grappling tournaments and stuff.
*  That's a dangerous move, man.
*  That's a dangerous move.
*  When Cubs wants him, blew his knee out, the quintet.
*  I was like, oh no.
*  And against Jake Shields, I'm like, hey dude,
*  Jake Shields is huge.
*  He's a lot bigger than you, man.
*  And he got, did you see it?
*  I didn't see it.
*  It was in a leg lock position.
*  I think it was like reaping.
*  Oh, that's terrible.
*  They were stuck in this bad position
*  and Cubs knee exploded.
*  Yeah, it's just a bad grappling matchup.
*  I mean, I know Cubs are black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,
*  but Jake is big.
*  He's a big guy and he's fucking strong
*  and he has a long career as a competitive Jiu-Jitsu player.
*  If you're a Cub and you're just doing real good,
*  you've had some wicked fights and you got a lot of momentum
*  and then you blow your fucking knee out
*  in this grappling competition, you're like, shit.
*  And he's like 35, I think, in that range.
*  That's a bad time to get injured like that.
*  And if you look at it, I'm a fighter
*  and I'm doing this grappling tournament as a thing.
*  A fun thing. A fun thing.
*  Then you have to go in there like,
*  if I have caught in a position or this is not going well,
*  I have to know that I'm a fighter, not a, you know.
*  Yes, you gotta be willing to tap quick.
*  Or at the end of the day, you're just sitting there
*  like, what the fuck?
*  Fuck, fuck, why'd I do that?
*  Fuck.
*  There was a lot of Jiu-Jitsu guys in that thing.
*  There's something about those leg locks too.
*  It's like a scary way to get hurt
*  because you're like, yikes, that's gonna be a bad one.
*  You know, when you see someone get heel hooked
*  and they're not tapping quick enough
*  and you see that look in their face, like, ah.
*  You're like, oh, you ain't recovering from that one
*  for a long ass time.
*  Now everybody's like training leg locks now.
*  That's like a newer thing, right?
*  I've been training with Eddie a bunch lately
*  and it's like getting used to just the Tim Planet style
*  of Jiu-Jitsu is so different.
*  And then like the lockdown every five seconds on my leg,
*  I gotta deal with that.
*  And then everybody's constantly going
*  for leg locks all the time.
*  I've just never, I've trained with a lot of teams
*  and a lot of ways over the years with Jiu-Jitsu.
*  It's just, it's a real issue.
*  It's a real issue.
*  It's a real issue.
*  Because there's not like a lot of room
*  for defense in certain spots, right?
*  Heel hook spots like E, like inside heel hooks, bro.
*  You got very little time to make a decision there.
*  Are you gonna roll out of this?
*  Are you just gonna tap down and preserve your shit?
*  Because you might get ripped apart.
*  And then Eddie's warm ups, we have to like,
*  you know, I'm sure you know, like the A's and the B's
*  and the C's and the C's.
*  It was like, I think it was C that we were doing.
*  Maybe it was B.
*  But it was like knee, knee bar, ankle lock, knee bar,
*  like foot, foot, foot, these things.
*  And that's just the warm up of the thing.
*  These guys are constantly working on those specific,
*  you know, style of Jiu-Jitsu around the leg locks,
*  foot locks and ankle locks.
*  It's a crazy time, you know?
*  And if you look at the professional Jiu-Jitsu scene,
*  if you look at the top of the food chain,
*  like the Gordon Rines and Craig Jones
*  and guys of that nature,
*  they're all known for having nasty leg locks.
*  John Donahers, guys.
*  Well, Craig is an Australian guy,
*  but Gordon Ryan, Gary Tonin, who's now a 1FC guy.
*  So-
*  Oh, he made his debut?
*  Yeah, he's fought several times.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Yeah, he's fought several times.
*  He's undefeated in MMA.
*  Awesome.
*  Yeah, he's doing really good.
*  It's a big deal.
*  It is a big deal.
*  Because, you know, whenever a guy like you,
*  who's a world champion in kickboxing,
*  or a guy like him who's a world champion in grappling,
*  makes its way into MMA,
*  like the advantage of your specialty is significant.
*  Right?
*  Like when you're standing up with someone,
*  your advantage for most guys against you
*  is pretty significant.
*  You know, if you were just having to kickboxing,
*  you'd find it'd be very significant.
*  So that's the same thing with grappling.
*  With a guy like Tonin, man,
*  he gets a hold of your shit.
*  You got real problems, man.
*  He's sneaky.
*  Quick.
*  Did you ever see that video where it was,
*  I think it was in Abu Dhabi,
*  where he hit this dude with a scissor sweep
*  right into a heel hook and like tapped him in 15 seconds?
*  Oh yeah, I was like immediate.
*  He just threw his body weight sideways
*  and fell right into the heel hook
*  and was immediately cranking on it.
*  And I feel like he has a couple of those.
*  Right?
*  Like this is his forte.
*  Well, he's so good defensively.
*  This is not it, but this is similar.
*  He did it on this guy too.
*  That's in just a grappling competition.
*  I think he's done it in MMA as well.
*  But he's so good defensively
*  that he's not really worried about you catching him
*  when you go to the ground.
*  So he'll do wild shit to get to the ground,
*  like dive into a flying scissor.
*  Because he's like, look, once we go to the ground,
*  my level is so high in comparison to most guys.
*  I can just get away with getting to the ground
*  in weird spots.
*  The confidence, even if I get in a weird spot,
*  I'm gonna still end up in a better position.
*  Yeah, this is right here.
*  Look at this, boom.
*  I mean, come on, man.
*  This dude tries to roll, he's like, tap, tap.
*  I mean, that is nasty, man.
*  He falls right into it, right into it.
*  Bam, ah!
*  That feeling of, feeling your shit separate
*  inside your knee, and you're like, oh, god damn it.
*  And it's so quick.
*  It's so quick.
*  Like you, do I even bother trying to figure out
*  what is your, no, get the fuck off.
*  Yeah, get off me, bitch.
*  Stop, stop, stop.
*  And some guys would just let them rip their knee apart.
*  There was a Gary Tonan, AJ,
*  how do you say his last name?
*  Eric Gazzan.
*  Agazzan.
*  Agazzan, who's also very talented.
*  And Gary Tonan had him in the craziest knee bar,
*  where his knee was just fucked.
*  Just bent completely out of place.
*  And he didn't tap.
*  He just let him fuck his knee up.
*  It's nasty to watch, too.
*  And then he's out for over a year or something?
*  I don't think he was out for that long,
*  believe it or not.
*  Damn.
*  I think he just dealt with the fact
*  that his shit was ripped up.
*  And he had, shout outs to him.
*  He had a wild.
*  Bellator fight.
*  Bellator.
*  Well his first one was fucking,
*  everybody was ragging on him.
*  He had a bunch of stupid faces,
*  didn't work out well.
*  But his last fight, they gave him a tough guy
*  that was part of that tournament.
*  And man, he really brought it.
*  It was good.
*  He really brought it.
*  It was an awesome fight.
*  It was really good.
*  He's super talented on the ground.
*  Really good.
*  And again, in comparison,
*  he can hang in there with guys like Tonan.
*  In comparison to the average MMA fighter,
*  he's gonna have a significant advantage.
*  For sure.
*  And you might find that Gary Tonan taps out.
*  His name is.
*  His name is tough to say.
*  There it is.
*  So look.
*  Look how bad his knee is.
*  Dude, look at that.
*  That is so bad.
*  That is so bad.
*  Look how far back that's going.
*  And Agazan just handles it.
*  Just deals with it.
*  He's like, I don't give a fuck.
*  I break my shit.
*  Like he's literally letting him fuck his knee up.
*  Look how bad.
*  Let me see that one more time.
*  Look how bad that thing is bent.
*  Look at that.
*  Bro, that's bad.
*  That's really bad.
*  Look how far it is past straight.
*  Ouchy.
*  And look how red Gary's face is.
*  Holy shit.
*  Gary's trying to murder everyone he's ever met.
*  Like that, right?
*  Huh?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  He's doing the wrong way.
*  Yeah.
*  Foot is coming toward his head.
*  I almost couldn't tell.
*  I know, cause it seems like it should be,
*  he should be facing the other direction
*  and it's bending backwards.
*  And he's even posting off of his own shit,
*  trying to get more off of that.
*  Like how red his face is.
*  He's going for that.
*  Yeah, that is, his knee is getting ripped apart there.
*  And his head is going this way
*  and his foot is going that way.
*  Not good.
*  Super duper not good.
*  And he's like, fucking fine.
*  Lifts his hands up fine.
*  Some people are just tough, man.
*  They can handle getting their leg ripped apart.
*  I've seen it.
*  John Jones did it against Vitor.
*  Vitor ruined his arm.
*  Ruined his arm.
*  Vitor got him in a full on arm bar,
*  fully hyper extended.
*  And John's like, fuck you.
*  I'm not tapping.
*  Like you can do whatever you want with that thing.
*  I got this one over here.
*  Remember Tim Slivvy getting his arm snapped in half?
*  Yes, Frank Mir.
*  Frank Mir.
*  And then the only person that saved
*  his entire fucking career was Herb Dean.
*  Herb Dean was like, hey, hey, hey,
*  your arm's broken.
*  He's like, come on, bro.
*  Yeah, he's like, let me fight.
*  And you know.
*  You were, you commentated that one.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, and you were like, something's going on here.
*  And they're like, they watched the video
*  and you're like, oh.
*  Well, the audience was booing.
*  And so I said, you gotta show these people the video.
*  Like, we gotta see this video.
*  And you know, the audience was booing.
*  And then they put it up on the big screen.
*  And then when they put it up on the big screen,
*  the moment you see it snap, you go, oh.
*  You hear it through the whole crowd like, oh.
*  It was the worst broken arm I've ever seen up to that point.
*  Someone else had a nasty one in the UFC.
*  And I can't think of it.
*  It was like a spiral fracture.
*  Minotauro versus Frank Mir.
*  Frank Mir got him in a camorra.
*  Minotauro didn't tap.
*  And he just, you heard it too.
*  You heard it.
*  Packed arena.
*  You hear.
*  Mm.
*  Ah!
*  And you see him sitting there looking at it like, ah.
*  Yeah, look at him.
*  Look at him looking at it like, fuck.
*  Have you ever hit somebody with that and torn their shit?
*  No.
*  I did when I was, it was a long time ago.
*  But I was, I had somebody in a camorra.
*  And they were like an upper belt
*  and just didn't think that they were stuck.
*  You could get them?
*  Yeah, thought it was whatever.
*  And I don't even know if it was like about me.
*  He was just not going with the camorra sweep.
*  It might even have been a sweep.
*  Oh, okay.
*  And he like just refused the sweep.
*  And his joint ripped.
*  And it sounded like if you took like a terry cloth towel
*  and just pulled it apart and it was like.
*  Oh, it was terrible.
*  And that gave me like nightmares for like weeks.
*  It was always in my head.
*  Cause it's right over you, right?
*  It's like right in your ear.
*  Oh, it's terrible.
*  Feel the tendons ripping apart.
*  Terrible, I don't know if I can make that sound.
*  Yeah, something like that, right?
*  Yeah, that's the rough thing about jujitsu, man.
*  If you break something, you're like,
*  well, now I'm out for six months.
*  If I'm lucky.
*  Yeah.
*  And the ego gets involved, right?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Yeah, that's the problem.
*  I have a lot of ego in jujitsu.
*  Oh, for sure, man.
*  You don't wanna let it go.
*  I always try to go into like, especially when I,
*  cause I go to a lot of different jujitsu gyms.
*  I'm not like a long-term guy, right?
*  So it's like, oh, that's Joe Schilling.
*  And like, I go in with no ego.
*  And there's always a guy that's gonna go like extra super hard.
*  This is his big moment, you know?
*  And it's, I just wanna.
*  Yeah, that is a problem.
*  These motherfuckers and their big moments.
*  And I'm like, bro, I know it's your big day,
*  but it's just like my Tuesday afternoon.
*  But that is the problem with a professional fighter
*  always training with civilians.
*  You never know.
*  You're not vetting these people.
*  They're like, there might be bad cops.
*  Like, you have no, bad cops are allowed to train jujitsu too.
*  If you're in a fucking place
*  and there's a guy who has that bad cop mentality,
*  and he happens to be a brown belt.
*  Bro, I'm so scared to get pulled over.
*  No.
*  I'm not even lying.
*  Let's just give the cops some love.
*  You want good cops.
*  We want good cops.
*  Cops are important.
*  And I know there's a lot of them.
*  I think there's more good cops than bad.
*  I really believe that.
*  I think it's just an insanely hard job.
*  And I think they're held to a standard
*  that they should be held to
*  because it's a life or death situation.
*  But it's a standard where your entire job
*  is you're dealing with conflict.
*  Conflict is very rare for people, right?
*  For regular people, not like you, you fight.
*  You know, you're pretty good at conflict.
*  But for regular folks,
*  they don't come into physical conflict on a regular basis.
*  It's very rare.
*  For a cop, it's every day.
*  You're overloading your system.
*  100%.
*  So if you have this guy who's already a little wacky
*  and then you put him into a everyday conflict situation
*  and then he's got seven years on the job,
*  who knows how nuts that guy is by the time
*  he does something stupid.
*  Which is why we just need to start the process with,
*  are you okay with conflict?
*  You know?
*  Let's go down the list.
*  You can't even ask them.
*  Are you gonna have issues about this?
*  You can't ask them.
*  You gotta make them carry the boat.
*  I think they should all go through BUDS training.
*  I really do.
*  Yeah, if any kind of thing.
*  Yeah, find out if they're exceptional.
*  Find out if there's something about them
*  that separates them from a regular person.
*  Well, if not, well guess what?
*  Having a gun and a fucking badge
*  and the ability to pull somebody over
*  and tell them what to do and shoot people,
*  that takes you out of the realm of a normal person.
*  If you wanna be a non-normal person,
*  you have to show the qualifications of a non-normal person.
*  And I think most of them can do it.
*  They could do it.
*  And if they listen to Jocko,
*  they let Jocko Willing take over the training
*  and just make sure everybody does 20% training,
*  we can radically reduce a lot of the interactions
*  of people that are negative.
*  Radically.
*  And then we can overshadow it with good stories of cops
*  doing good things and change the perspective.
*  But right now, everybody needs to see there's a problem
*  so they can be fixed.
*  Yes.
*  Right?
*  They do need to see that.
*  And that's why even the people that are mad
*  and they don't like you now and they're pissed off at you,
*  I hope they understand your perspective.
*  And that's why I wanted to, first of all, I love you.
*  So I wanted to have you on,
*  because I always love seeing you.
*  But I wanted to have you on
*  because I know that this means something to you.
*  This is not just some celeb cause.
*  We were talking about that goofy video
*  that those people made.
*  You know, like, I'm gonna be held accountable.
*  I'm not a part of the problem.
*  No, you're doing that not for the likes.
*  You're losing people, man.
*  I know people are falling off here and they're mad at you.
*  But you're doing it because it means something to you
*  and you actually care and you want people to know.
*  This is a fucking real problem.
*  And it's a problem with black people for sure.
*  It's also a problem with just people.
*  And this better not get lost in this conversation,
*  this message.
*  For sure, I'm down with police reform everywhere, for sure.
*  Whether it's Black Lives Matter or whatever's happening.
*  We need some police reform.
*  We need them to be held accountable.
*  They need to be held accountable for women,
*  for old men, for everybody.
*  You just can't just do that.
*  You can't just behave that way.
*  They need to be held accountable.
*  I think so many of us are based,
*  just like the coronavirus,
*  probably you could say the same thing.
*  Because I haven't encountered it, I don't think it's real.
*  Just like people haven't encountered an asshole cop,
*  which I find hard to believe, or racism,
*  that it's not real, you know what I mean?
*  Well, white people that discount racism
*  are the most hilarious.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  Well, that's easy to say.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  Yeah, it's...
*  The idea that it doesn't exist is pretty silly,
*  and the idea that all cops are good is also pretty silly.
*  All people are not good.
*  It's too hard.
*  It's too hard to be a person.
*  It's hard.
*  And people need checks and balances.
*  Every level of every job,
*  anybody has to have some accountability,
*  has to have some checks and balances.
*  We can't have a government
*  that nobody gets any checks and balances.
*  Every news channel all the time
*  back checks and talks shit about every tweet
*  that the president makes or anybody.
*  We're constantly doing that.
*  Why do we just blindly believe
*  that the police don't ever make mistakes?
*  And if we want to all admit
*  that they have a hard job or whatever,
*  that's just as much more reason
*  that we should all be checking in on them
*  and making sure that they're not going fucking ape shit.
*  Well said.
*  Thank you.
*  You're not a bad guy, Joe Schilling.
*  You just want people to be held accountable.
*  I just want to be held accountable.
*  Because you're a bad motherfucker
*  and you want bad motherfuckers to be cops.
*  That's right.
*  There you go, not bitch ass dudes.
*  Not bitch ass dudes.
*  That's what it is.
*  Straight up, yeah.
*  It's really clear.
*  That's a respectful position.
*  I was talking to my buddy about it.
*  Can you imagine being scared?
*  You have to go pull this person over.
*  And we think that a cop's probably a pussy.
*  That's why he did it.
*  But if he knows he's a pussy,
*  he knows he's a pussy walking to the car,
*  oh fuck, oh, if he, oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's what we're dealing with.
*  These are the guys we're giving the guns to.
*  Not all of them, but some of them.
*  100%.
*  That's so important.
*  It's like one of the things you would tell people
*  if you were talking to a kid and he was like,
*  do you think I should do martial arts for self defense?
*  100%.
*  No, you're a pussy.
*  It's not cut out for it.
*  Like straight up.
*  I don't mean those people.
*  No, but there are those people.
*  It's the same honesty.
*  A lot of those guys, they'll get into Jiu Jitsu
*  and they wind up strangling folks.
*  Yeah, well, good.
*  Jiu Jitsu's different, man.
*  Because you don't have to get punched.
*  You have to get really good.
*  There's something about, like,
*  like you would admit to this, right?
*  There's people that get good at Jiu Jitsu
*  that would never get good at striking.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  And the process, yes, because you actually practice Jiu Jitsu
*  without getting hit in the face,
*  whereas you're not gonna actually get good at striking
*  unless you're getting struck, which is very difficult.
*  You gotta go in the danger zone, son.
*  You can stay out of the danger zone with Jiu Jitsu.
*  You can do live drills.
*  You can do a lot of things.
*  But sparring is sparring.
*  And the first time some guy fucking punches you in the face
*  and you see stars and your nose starts running
*  and your eyes are watering, you're like, oh my God.
*  Because I can make you look great on the pads.
*  I could teach you the fitness.
*  You could have the body.
*  You could have shadow box.
*  You could do all of that.
*  But when that shit happens.
*  When that shit happens, it's real.
*  And in Jiu Jitsu, you get to go again.
*  In Jiu Jitsu, a guy catches you.
*  We all get caught.
*  The guy gets you in an arm bar.
*  Okay, tap, and you can go right again.
*  If someone flatlines you, you're fucked for the day.
*  This is not a normal thing for your body to experience.
*  And you can't necessarily point that out,
*  at least not when they walk into the gym.
*  Nope.
*  You train them for a whole fight.
*  That's what I tell my fighters all the time.
*  Your first 10 fights, I have no idea.
*  I have a hoping what you're gonna do, but I don't know.
*  We'll be in there, the smoker, smoker fire.
*  Warm up good, eat good, cut weight good.
*  You're good.
*  Everything you're saying is great.
*  And then you get out there in front of the lights
*  and it's just not for you.
*  It's not your time.
*  Or you could be a Justin Gaethje,
*  who can somehow or another ignore those lights.
*  There's dudes that just ignore those lights.
*  They don't mean shit.
*  That guy comes out, just looks at you like this.
*  Just dead faced.
*  He's not freaking out.
*  Daniel Rodriguez, same thing.
*  Same thing.
*  Same thing, like ice cold.
*  He looks like a guy who would be ice cold.
*  Ice cold.
*  Those guys excel.
*  Those guys excel because how much of a factor
*  is it is dealing with the anxiety.
*  The first time I cornered him for a fight,
*  he like go warm up, we're gonna run up.
*  Everybody, every fighter is a little different.
*  Some guys like long warmups, some guys are panicking to death.
*  We just keep an eye and see what's going on.
*  So it was first time, I'm not sure what he's gonna do.
*  We're warming him up and he's like,
*  all right, you got like 10 minutes before the next fight.
*  He's like, you need anything else?
*  I'm like, nah, I'm cool, chilling.
*  He sits down, he gets on his phone.
*  He's like, just looking at the phone,
*  sweep it through and shit.
*  I'm like, commission comes, he's like, okay, you're next up.
*  He's like, all right, cool.
*  He's just stumbling through his phone.
*  Nothing's happening.
*  How long did he warm up?
*  We did probably like 15, 20 minutes.
*  Oh, okay.
*  We gotta get Spike going.
*  Got the first little bit out.
*  He was just chilling.
*  I'm like noticing what's going on
*  and I don't wanna make a scene,
*  but I went in his ear and I was like,
*  hey man, this shit you're doing right now,
*  it's like, it's cool as fuck and all that,
*  but just make sure you turn the switch
*  when it's time to go.
*  And he looked at me like, yeah, I got it.
*  And sure enough, he did it, right?
*  Just smokes the guy and the guy had
*  way more experience than him.
*  This was a small local show.
*  Then after the fight, we go to the bar
*  and he's got all his friends and family there and shit.
*  And he's having a few drinks
*  and he puts his arm around me.
*  He was like, hey man, you know what you were saying?
*  Make sure I turn the switch.
*  I was like, yeah.
*  Man, I've been to jail a lot, like a lot,
*  and I've fought a lot of people.
*  He's like, I don't get nervous when I fight one person.
*  And I was like.
*  Pfft.
*  Pfft.
*  Pfft.
*  Pfft.
*  Pfft.
*  Pfft.
*  Pfft.
*  Cha-ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.
*  We got a winner.
*  We got a winner here, folks.
*  And then I was like, okay, we'll see about this.
*  But his UFC debut,
*  I'm gonna forget the guy's, he fucking fought.
*  Yeah, man.
*  He fought a really good guy from New Mexico,
*  South Pole.
*  Don't remember it.
*  Man, I can't believe I'm not remembering it.
*  Pull it up, young Jamie.
*  Man, the guy, there's a lot of respect.
*  He's a really tough dude.
*  He's almost like a gatekeeper, so to speak.
*  And D-Rod took it on like two weeks notice
*  and went in there, and same thing.
*  He's like, warms up real laid back.
*  He's like damn near sleeping in the locker room.
*  They're like, you're up next.
*  He's like, all right, cool, whatever.
*  And he's like totally ice cold.
*  Then we walk out for the fight.
*  And after they check your nails and mouthpiece
*  and all that, you have a moment.
*  Everybody always hugs, which I think is weird.
*  You're going off to battle or something.
*  But he turns around and I was like, amen.
*  It's a big show.
*  Just take it all in.
*  You got this, whatever.
*  I was like, what's the game plan?
*  He's like, fuck this dude up.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what you wanna see?
*  Then I was like, but how are we gonna do that?
*  He's like, so I'm gonna move my feet.
*  I'm gonna pick the angles, blah, blah, blah.
*  But he was just ice cold.
*  And then he stops the dude.
*  It was a phenomenal performance.
*  That guy is a rare breed when it comes to staying calm
*  under pressure.
*  It's almost like prison is cross fitting,
*  cross training.
*  Who's he got here?
*  Tim Means.
*  Oh, Tim Means is very good, man.
*  Yeah, very, very good.
*  And he kind of made a standing guillotine.
*  Standing guillotine after he dropped him.
*  That's a big deal.
*  Tim Means is very good.
*  On your debut. And he's very sneaky.
*  On short notice.
*  Debut, short notice, and you're dealing with a guy
*  who has an insane amount of competition under his belt.
*  I mean, Tim Means is a fucking real world class fighter.
*  De-Roz the Truth.
*  Yeah, there's guys like that out there.
*  But it almost is like cross training.
*  Like prison is like mental cross training.
*  I mean, you think of dealing with
*  adversity, confrontation, believing in yourself,
*  like showing up, like I'm not a bitch.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like that's a lot of that.
*  Like if you get a guy and he comes to Jiu Jitsu,
*  and he comes from gymnastics, you're like, oh shit.
*  Like you never done Jiu Jitsu ever?
*  Like dude, you gotta get good quick.
*  You're a gymnast.
*  If you get some guy who does the rings,
*  imagine how good he's gonna be at Jiu Jitsu.
*  Pauly Morse, dude.
*  Yes, yeah.
*  One of those motherfuckers.
*  How good is that gonna be?
*  He's pushing off hips and shit.
*  And that's kind of the same way you would think about
*  a guy who's been in a lot of street fights and prison fights.
*  Like the anxiety aspect of fighting,
*  as long as you have the athletic aspect as well.
*  But having that anxiety alleviation
*  of knowing how to keep your shit together.
*  It's like when someone else is having like an anxiety
*  attack or aspect to deal with,
*  and someone else feels right at home.
*  Not even the opposite of that.
*  Like feels good, like he's happy.
*  Ooh, that's fuckin'.
*  And sees it.
*  Yeah, sees it when they're on, yeah.
*  That's fuckin' terrifying.
*  Bad place to be.
*  Joe Schilling, we did three hours already.
*  Yeah, time flies.
*  Time flies.
*  Does.
*  Don't feel in any way like you said anything negative.
*  You are 100% right.
*  Everything you said, all that shit you put on your Instagram,
*  it doesn't mean you're a bad person or you're anti-cop.
*  You just don't wanna see the disgusting shit
*  that you keep posting over and over again.
*  Yeah, man, I just want everybody that are my people,
*  which is all people that are in the United States,
*  to like land of the free, home of the brave.
*  Like all the shit that we grew up on,
*  thinking this planet we're supposed to be,
*  like let's stick to that.
*  Let's hold each other accountable to that.
*  Yeah, and don't defund the police.
*  Please.
*  But they don't need tanks either.
*  They probably don't need tanks.
*  Goodbye everybody.
*  Thank you, goodnight.
*  Damn.
*  That was great.
*  That was good.
*  That was fun, man.
