# Joe Rogan Experience #2063 - The Rock
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5.72s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=13.72s)]
*  How fun was that? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=14.72s)]
*  That was a blast. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=15.72s)]
*  We had a good day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=16.72s)]
*  Dude, that was three hours. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=17.72s)]
*  Yeah, we got Shane Gillis, Brian Simpson, Asan Ahmad, Tony Hinchcliffe, Duncan Trussell, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=19.72s)]
*  you and me. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=27.16s)]
*  We had a fucking banging workout. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=28.28s)]
*  Then we did the sauna. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=30.76s)]
*  We did the cold plunge. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=32.2s)]
*  We did the whole experience. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=33.2s)]
*  We did the sauna again. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=34.2s)]
*  Yeah, cold plunge again. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=35.2s)]
*  I did it twice. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=36.2s)]
*  Cold plunge, man. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=37.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=38.2s)]
*  That was great. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=39.2s)]
*  And I love what you're doing down here, by the way, with the boys. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=40.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=42.2s)]
*  Getting down here, giving them this opportunity to get after it, not only in their craft, but [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=43.2s)]
*  also getting in shape. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=47.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=49.16s)]
*  Those guys are really good. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=50.16s)]
*  Two dudes with diabetes today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=51.16s)]
*  They just don't work out, you know. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=54.16s)]
*  We're doing it now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  This is the third week. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  And we've been talking about it forever. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  But when Shane moved to town, he's like, dude, I got to get in shape. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=62.64s)]
*  I got to do something. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=65.86s)]
*  I go, listen, let's start on Monday, nice and light. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=66.86s)]
*  And so we started nice and light. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=70.74s)]
*  Today was a pretty hard day for them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=72.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=73.74s)]
*  But generally, it's pretty easy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=74.74s)]
*  I just have them do push-ups, bodyweight squats, and a series of very light kettlebell [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=76.62s)]
*  routines, just simple stuff. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=81.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=83.1s)]
*  Just get them used to it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=84.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=85.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=86.1s)]
*  The sprints on the bag. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=87.3s)]
*  The bag was great, by the way. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=88.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=89.3s)]
*  It's a great way to end it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=90.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=91.3s)]
*  Great way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=92.3s)]
*  Great way. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=93.3s)]
*  But I like working out with those guys. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=94.3s)]
*  You feel it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=95.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=96.3s)]
*  You feel their desire. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=97.3s)]
*  None of them quit. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=98.3s)]
*  None of them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=99.3s)]
*  No, they hung in there. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=100.3s)]
*  Posted out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=101.3s)]
*  They were there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=102.3s)]
*  They hung in there through the sauna. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=103.3s)]
*  They hung in there through the cold plunge. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=104.3s)]
*  Everything. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=105.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=106.3s)]
*  It's just, they want to do it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=107.3s)]
*  You know, sometimes people just need a little help. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=108.3s)]
*  They're not used to doing it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=109.3s)]
*  They know they want to get in shape, but they don't know how. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=110.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=112.34s)]
*  They don't know how to take that first step, and they just need a little bit of help, especially [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=113.58s)]
*  if it's different with you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=116.3s)]
*  And luckily for me, too, we grew up in that environment where it pushes us and it's what [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=118.06s)]
*  we do and it's part of our DNA. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=122.30000000000001s)]
*  But you get to, and all those guys, it's really cool. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=125.06s)]
*  They look to you for the show me the way and they do it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=132.02s)]
*  Well, they realize once they've done it a few times, they walk out here, they feel so [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=133.02s)]
*  good. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  They feel so, like I get text messages from each one of them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=137.42000000000002s)]
*  They're like, oh, I feel fucking great. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=140.3s)]
*  I feel great. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=142.1s)]
*  That's you don't want to walk out of a workout beat up. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=143.85999999999999s)]
*  You want to walk out just a little energized, feeling better, and then slowly ramp things [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=146.06s)]
*  up. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=150.74s)]
*  This is week three. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=151.74s)]
*  Today was the hardest day. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=152.74s)]
*  But it was just, you know, you were here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=153.74s)]
*  I was like, we got it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=155.74s)]
*  We got the rocks here. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=156.74s)]
*  We got to go. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=157.74s)]
*  We lit it up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=158.74s)]
*  We lit it up. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=159.74s)]
*  But they hung in there and everybody walked out with a big smile on their face. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=160.74s)]
*  We all had a great time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=163.5s)]
*  It was so good, man. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=164.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's so good. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=165.5s)]
*  And I and I told some of the boys this, like, I miss that kind of stuff because it's been [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=166.74s)]
*  a while, you know, since I worked out with the boys back when I was wrestling, we'd all [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=171.66s)]
*  work together because we were traveling together every night and go into the same gym every [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=175.66s)]
*  day and or different cities. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  But I miss that that camaraderie. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=181.74s)]
*  Yeah, the camaraderie is nice. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=183.22s)]
*  I kind of use my workout. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=184.86s)]
*  Most of the time I work out alone. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=187.1s)]
*  I used to work with a trainer. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=188.1s)]
*  But after a while, I realized, like, I don't need to help push myself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  I just write a routine. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=193.18s)]
*  And there's a certain meditative aspect to being alone with your thoughts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=194.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=198.34s)]
*  And just I like to put fights on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=199.34s)]
*  It's like a watch something in between sets. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=201.06s)]
*  But I just like to be and I like to be accountable 100 percent for my work. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=203.5s)]
*  Like, I know what I have to do. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  I know what I do it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=210.57999999999998s)]
*  And it sets the tone for the day, which sets the tone for my life. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=211.89999999999998s)]
*  That's how I feel. It's the same thing with me in training. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=216.5s)]
*  I love training alone. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=218.98s)]
*  And it's been a long time since I trained with the boys. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=221.1s)]
*  That's why I was a real treat. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=222.89999999999998s)]
*  It was fun. It was fun. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=224.42s)]
*  Those guys are all hilarious. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  Fucking hilarious. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=227.62s)]
*  It's a lot of talking shit, talking shit and some jokes. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=229.46s)]
*  He's so out of his mind. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=232.18s)]
*  He's so great. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=233.5s)]
*  And she is great. It was amazing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=234.62s)]
*  But the training alone, though, that is important, you know, for the mental. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  I feel like for me, it anchors my day, but also to life is so busy and crazy [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=240.62s)]
*  from the moment you wake up and you walk outside. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=245.58s)]
*  Everybody's wanting something from you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=247.38s)]
*  Yeah. So for many of us, by the way, whether celebrity or not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=248.86s)]
*  Yeah. So it's nice to have that anchor in the morning. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=252.9s)]
*  Do you train in the mornings? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=255.02s)]
*  Yeah, always in the morning. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=256.74s)]
*  But sometimes I do in the afternoon if I have some sort of an appointment or [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=257.78s)]
*  something, I'll work. I just get it in. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=261.34s)]
*  I must get it in. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=263.14s)]
*  But I like to start the day with it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  That's what I like to do. Yeah, me too. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=267.5s)]
*  It's the best way. It's like you get it out of the way. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=269.61999999999995s)]
*  And also I like to do it fast. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=271.7s)]
*  It's I wake up and have a cup of coffee, get some pre-workout in me and just [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=272.94s)]
*  fucking let's go. That's it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  And I go right into the cold plunge. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  So the first thing is suffering, like right away suffer for it's cold outside. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=283.02s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? Get in there. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=287.06s)]
*  Suffer. Suffer for three minutes and then warm yourself up to working out and then [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=288.46s)]
*  then get into it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=292.78s)]
*  But we did it reverse today, was it? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Because how come we did it reverse? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=295.7s)]
*  Well, those guys are not really ready to get in the cold plunge first. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=297.34s)]
*  Don't dive in first. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's next level. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=303.06s)]
*  I get them in the cold plunge after the sauna because it's easier because your [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=304.29999999999995s)]
*  body temperature is already heated up and there's a certain amount of relief [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=308.02s)]
*  when you get into the cold water because you know, in that one hundred [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=311.06s)]
*  and eighty five degrees for 20 minutes. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  When you get in that cold, then your body relaxes. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=315.5s)]
*  And I just did it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=318.1s)]
*  I just want to get him accustomed to doing a sauna and press the shit out of me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=319.02s)]
*  Three minutes is first time you did to three minutes your first time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=322.5s)]
*  You man. Yeah, you just stayed calm as fuck in there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=325.18s)]
*  I felt like that's the thing to do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=328.26s)]
*  Yeah, you get in and I heard you coaching the boys. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=330.1s)]
*  Breathe. Yeah, you're good. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=333.14s)]
*  Just accept it. Just accept it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=334.82s)]
*  Don't because your brain goes, we got to get the fuck out of here. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  I got to get the fuck out of here. I can't do this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=339.58s)]
*  I can't do this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=340.74s)]
*  And if you let that shit roll around in your head, then you're up. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=341.5s)]
*  But it's also good practice for not letting that shit roll around [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=345.18s)]
*  your head in everyday life, because there's times in everyday life [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=348.5s)]
*  where you just like can make a rash decision because your brain ramps up [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  the wrong way. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=355.42s)]
*  And if you just stay calm, you can see a rational solution [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=356.42s)]
*  or a rational way to handle any kind of shit that any kind of shit [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=360.82s)]
*  that's going down. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=363.74s)]
*  Yes. The ability to keep your head together. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=364.42s)]
*  That's right. And you're in that cold water is like, you want to. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=366.66s)]
*  Give me the fuck out of here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=371.1s)]
*  It goes against every fiber. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=372.74s)]
*  Yeah. In your body. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=374.66s)]
*  Yeah. And as you know, like today was my first cold plunge. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=375.86s)]
*  I ordered it. It gets delivered next week. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=378.82000000000005s)]
*  But today was the first one. Nice. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=380.82000000000005s)]
*  So that's why I had to do it. Which one did you get? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=382.54s)]
*  I don't know which one I got. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=385.82000000000005s)]
*  There's a bunch of good ones out there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=387.42s)]
*  I know I needed just a longer one. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you need a bigger one. You barely fit in ours. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=390.66s)]
*  You're fucking switched up in there. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  It's hilarious. Great. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=395.86s)]
*  Yeah, that one is interesting because that's called a blue cube. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=397.58000000000004s)]
*  And the blue cube has a very cool option where you can crank up [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=400.3s)]
*  the water flow. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=403.98s)]
*  So you get it down. So it spins. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=405.82s)]
*  Yeah. So it's 37 degrees. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=407.54s)]
*  And then you hit this switch and it's just like a raging river. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=409.42s)]
*  So you never get a thermal layer. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=414.1s)]
*  So the thing that happens in the cold plunge is like a minute in, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=416.26s)]
*  your body develops sort of a thermal layer. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=418.62s)]
*  And it actually is more tolerable after a minute than it is for the first minute. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=420.98s)]
*  But not with that raging river. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=424.94s)]
*  When that shit's in there, like it's never tolerable. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=427.14000000000004s)]
*  You just sit there the whole three minutes, just white knuckle in it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=429.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=432.94s)]
*  So it's harder. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=435.26s)]
*  How often are you doing the raging river part? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=436.18s)]
*  What do you say? Do it without these guys. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=439.3s)]
*  Yeah. Don't let these guys. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm trying not to get anybody to quit. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=443.34s)]
*  You know, today I was worried. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=445.34s)]
*  I was like, yeah, fucking kind of pushing them because we added Renegade Rose today. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=446.46s)]
*  We had windmills. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=450.1s)]
*  I added a few things to the routine. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=451.5s)]
*  But the last two or three workout, two workouts, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=453.82s)]
*  I've been finishing them with the rounds on the bag. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=457.34s)]
*  So you do this Tabata Sprint. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=460.22s)]
*  So it's 20 seconds of just going out and then 10 seconds rest. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=462.22s)]
*  20 seconds, 10 seconds rest. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=466.06s)]
*  It's an amazing protocol for developing cardio. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=467.86s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, it was amazing. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=470.62s)]
*  I'd never done that before. And it was great. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  You know what I also loved I noticed about the guys is after the workout was done, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=473.98s)]
*  they're spent, they're feeling good. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=477.5s)]
*  They're feeling great about themselves. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=478.86s)]
*  And I think pretty much all of them said, hey, we're doing this tomorrow. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=480.74s)]
*  Right. Yeah. It was good. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=483.98s)]
*  Because, you know, when that shit really kicks your ass, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=485.22s)]
*  and you don't ask that question. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=487.66s)]
*  Well, if they wake up sore, who knows? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=489.14s)]
*  Because there's a few things that we did that are going to their legs are going to be sore for sure. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=490.94s)]
*  For like the between the legs stuff and the windmill stuff. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=494.74s)]
*  But we'll do something different tomorrow. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=497.46s)]
*  So tomorrow I'll get them in here. We'll do something different. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=499.78s)]
*  Keep them going. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=502.09999999999997s)]
*  Are you banging them out? Like, would you say five times a week? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=503.06s)]
*  Whenever they want to come. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=506.14s)]
*  So like right now it's been three days a week. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=507.74s)]
*  But if you guys want to go five days a week, go five days a week. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=509.9s)]
*  You let me know what you want to do and we'll do it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=512.86s)]
*  And I just I try to give them some stuff. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=515.54s)]
*  Like if you're on the road, just do the push ups in the bodyweight routine. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=517.54s)]
*  Just try. You don't have to do a hundred. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=520.9s)]
*  I do a hundred. I do sets of twenty two sets of ten five whatever. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=522.4599999999999s)]
*  Just do it and just make sure the if you so say if you do like 50 push ups and 50 body weight squats one day, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=526.74s)]
*  the next day, try to make it 60. Try to get the 60. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=533.26s)]
*  Try to eventually get to 100. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=536.4599999999999s)]
*  And if you have to do 10 sets of 10, that's pretty easy to do. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=538.26s)]
*  Ten is not hard. You know, and then the last one you like. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=541.18s)]
*  And eventually you'll get to a point where you could do sets of 20. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=544.42s)]
*  And it's just it's easy. It's not that hard to do. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=547.98s)]
*  You like when I do 20 at the end of 20, I could do way more. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  But I just relax and then I do the bodyweight squats. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=553.5s)]
*  And if you keep doing it, it just conditions your body to be able to do that all the time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=555.98s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=561.18s)]
*  And it's great warm up. Fifteen minutes and you're sweating. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=562.9s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=565.26s)]
*  So we start off with that and then you go right into all the other stuff. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=566.34s)]
*  So by that, bodies are heated up. You're ready to rock and ready to go. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=569.3s)]
*  Yeah. And also, too, I feel like if you especially for guys like that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=572.98s)]
*  who are just getting into it and dipping their toes into it, feeling good, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=576.1s)]
*  they know they have to do it. Yeah. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=579.66s)]
*  They're going to add some years to their life, right. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=581.42s)]
*  And take care of their families. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=583.0600000000001s)]
*  But also, it was cool that you realize that as these guys are doing it, they're [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=584.38s)]
*  they're not again, they're not giving up. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=589.42s)]
*  But also you could see it kind of computing in their head like, OK, two steps forward, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=591.74s)]
*  maybe one little step back. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=596.38s)]
*  You had the math and you do that every day. You're far down that road. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=598.02s)]
*  You're far down that road. And that's what I keep telling them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=600.78s)]
*  I said, this is just a thing where you got to not slide off [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=603.06s)]
*  because the slide off is the hardest part. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=607.4599999999999s)]
*  Like the discipline is very hard, but the slide off, it's so hard to avoid [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=609.38s)]
*  the slide off when you're used to eating bad food and fucking around [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=613.98s)]
*  and staying up late and drinking like all these guys do. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=618.74s)]
*  It's really hard to be disciplined. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=622.38s)]
*  And just to say, no matter what, even if I travel on the road, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=624.66s)]
*  I got to get workouts in because I can't lose ground. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=628.18s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=630.54s)]
*  Especially like wrestling. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=631.86s)]
*  I feel like comedy is a lot like wrestling just in terms of the schedule [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  because you guys are working at nights. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=636.02s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes twice a night. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=637.4599999999999s)]
*  You start at seven thirty. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  You're done by maybe midnight, maybe longer. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=639.78s)]
*  So it's that kind of lifestyle that we really got to be disciplined. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=642.5799999999999s)]
*  Were you were you always disciplined even when you got in comedy full time [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=645.66s)]
*  and you were on the road and doing all that? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=649.9s)]
*  I was more disciplined than other comics, but not that disciplined. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=651.42s)]
*  Not like I am now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=656.66s)]
*  I think as I get older, I realize like you only have so much [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=657.8199999999999s)]
*  like your body only has so much energy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=664.06s)]
*  And if you're not in shape, your body is going to have less energy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=666.78s)]
*  And as you get old, I have so many friends that are my age [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=670.18s)]
*  that look like they're dead. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=672.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, Jesus Christ. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=673.98s)]
*  You know, 56. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=675.22s)]
*  And at a certain point in time, you realize like, OK, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=676.22s)]
*  this can't be like a thing you do three days a week. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=679.54s)]
*  There's got to be a thing you do every day. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=683.66s)]
*  My body has to like know for sure it's going to work. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=685.4599999999999s)]
*  And every day, work has got to get done. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=688.5799999999999s)]
*  And if it doesn't do that, I feel like it's going to slide off. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=690.9399999999999s)]
*  And when I've taken days off and then I get back to it's like, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=693.9s)]
*  I feel way more slide now than I did when I was 20 or 30. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=696.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like the slide is like, you know, like, you like your. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=701.6199999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's steeper. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  It lasts longer. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=706.0999999999999s)]
*  It's harder to get back up there again. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=707.18s)]
*  OK, stay here. Don't let it slide. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=708.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Is your slide. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=711.0999999999999s)]
*  Is it is it usually come by way? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=713.66s)]
*  Like if you catch a fucking cold or something like that, that could happen. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=715.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that could be it. Or too many days of no sleep. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=720.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Too many days. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=723.66s)]
*  No sleep will get me, you know, if I'm just traveling a lot or doing something [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=724.9399999999999s)]
*  that's like very intensive and I have to get up in the morning [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  or have to handle something and family stuff or whatever. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=731.02s)]
*  If I have to get up early, it's just that that wrecks you. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=733.14s)]
*  That's the one that gets you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=736.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And then you take a day or two off and then you're like, fuck. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=737.26s)]
*  Yeah. And then you got to travel again. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=740.4599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, maybe you're going overseas and, you know, then it's a long travel. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=742.14s)]
*  Yeah. You got to plan your workouts. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=745.86s)]
*  But you just have to do it. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=747.9s)]
*  If you don't, if you just decide to take a nap, then you won't do it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=749.14s)]
*  And then you're going to take the fucking nap later. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=753.18s)]
*  Let's go. Yeah. You got to go. Let's go. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=755.46s)]
*  When you land, this is what I like doing when I travel out of the country [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=757.5s)]
*  and I land whatever time it is right to the gym. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=760.62s)]
*  At the gym. Yep. Yeah. Yep. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=763.42s)]
*  That's the only way, I think, to avoid like significant jet lag. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=764.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes. The other thing that they say is to fast. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=768.66s)]
*  They say even if you're on a 16 hour flight, don't eat on the flight. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=771.4200000000001s)]
*  They say don't eat on the flight. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=775.82s)]
*  And the idea behind that is. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=777.58s)]
*  I don't know why, but everybody that I've talked to says to avoid jet lag. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=779.46s)]
*  One of the best ways is to not eat on the flight and to just sort of land, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=783.98s)]
*  get a workout in and let your body get back on its normal cycle. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=789.5s)]
*  And you won't have the same kind of jet lag. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=792.66s)]
*  And still not eat when you land. Just land, train. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=794.38s)]
*  I can't do that. I've never done it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=797.22s)]
*  I'm not applying. I'm eating. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=798.66s)]
*  Three, four times. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=800.8199999999999s)]
*  Gotta eat, brother. Yes. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=802.26s)]
*  Fucking eating all the time. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=803.26s)]
*  I just I don't like the idea of not eating when I'm on a plane. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=804.6999999999999s)]
*  Like, hmm. Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=807.66s)]
*  I'm going to eat. Got to eat. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=809.06s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's something. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=810.54s)]
*  There's 100 percent something to the workout, though. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=812.0999999999999s)]
*  That seems to reset me as good as anything. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=814.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe not eating and then a workout would be even better. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=816.18s)]
*  But I've never tried it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=819.06s)]
*  How do you do this? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=821.0999999999999s)]
*  Because I think about this, too, as well, like the difference between. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=822.06s)]
*  When you're tired and you feel like we've been here before, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  I know I'm fucking fatigued. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=830.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I'm still going to push through this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=831.8199999999999s)]
*  And like you said, I'm going to get it in, whether it's at midnight or seven. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=833.3s)]
*  How do you how do you know the difference between that and compared to? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=836.3s)]
*  Something's wrong. Dude, I got to listen to my body. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=839.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. This I think it's just an education. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=841.86s)]
*  You know, you you have over time, right? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=845.02s)]
*  Yeah. You have those days where you do push it when you shouldn't. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=846.8199999999999s)]
*  And then you get sick. Yeah. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=849.26s)]
*  And you go, OK, I see what I did. Yeah. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=850.62s)]
*  Or you have those days where you push through and you feel way better. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=852.74s)]
*  I've had those, too. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=857.0999999999999s)]
*  And you got to kind of feel them out. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=858.3s)]
*  And the only way you know is if you know your body. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=860.3s)]
*  And the only way you know your body is if you push your body all the time and try [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=862.18s)]
*  it. Yeah. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=864.9799999999999s)]
*  When you when you're you have a fucking insane schedule, you're [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=866.2199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I know a lot of people with insane schedules, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=869.9799999999999s)]
*  but yours might be at the top of the list. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  You're right up there with anybody. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=873.66s)]
*  I don't know how you maintain all of the things that you do and still have energy. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=875.5s)]
*  Yeah. What I try to do is try to schedule my day as best as I can. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=881.8599999999999s)]
*  And, you know, when you're busy and all of us are busy in our own way. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=888.02s)]
*  So I really try to make sure that I'm paying attention to the schedule. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=892.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm really looking at it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=895.58s)]
*  And I'm going to take a fine tooth comb through it and go. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=897.0600000000001s)]
*  Not that because it's easy just to say, yeah, I'll do it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh, this thing is for 10 minutes, Joe. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=903.74s)]
*  Can you? Yeah. OK. I'll do it. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=905.22s)]
*  And before you know it, all that shit, it's an hour and then it's two hours and all that. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=906.58s)]
*  So I really try to make sure that I'm looking at the schedule [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=910.26s)]
*  and try to be smart about the moves these days. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=913.1800000000001s)]
*  And I also learned that there's just power in saying no. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=915.14s)]
*  Yeah. No, you got to have you time. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=919.58s)]
*  Yes. You time is important. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=922.62s)]
*  Like you can't. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=924.3s)]
*  One of the things I always tell everybody disciplines really important, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=925.18s)]
*  but also enthusiasm is really important. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=927.54s)]
*  Like in that's right. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=930.18s)]
*  I tell these guys with comedy, if you feel burnt out, take some days off. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=931.1s)]
*  Yes. There's no harm in that. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=934.54s)]
*  Like you want enthusiasm. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=936.3s)]
*  There's like something about being enthusiastic with comedy. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=937.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think with a lot of things like you want to have that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=941.22s)]
*  You don't want it to be a drudgery. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=943.38s)]
*  That's right. Yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=945.5s)]
*  Yeah. You don't want it to be a colonoscopy. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=946.46s)]
*  You want to go in there. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=948.7800000000001s)]
*  You want to have a good time and you want to appreciate it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=949.82s)]
*  And sometimes you overdo things. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=952.0600000000001s)]
*  You just don't feel that enthusiastic about them. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=954.1800000000001s)]
*  So you got to balance it out. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=956.7800000000001s)]
*  But again, it's an education. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=958.1s)]
*  So you got to do it the wrong way. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=959.58s)]
*  And they go, OK, what did I fuck up and learn from it? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I would say with enthusiasm, you can really move mountains. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=963.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=966.34s)]
*  Really move mountains with enthusiasm because it starts with that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=967.5s)]
*  Mike Tyson had a great phrase. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=970.34s)]
*  He said, discipline is doing what you hate to do, but doing it like you love it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=971.9s)]
*  That's real discipline. Yeah. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=976.38s)]
*  That is that's what made Mike Tyson. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=977.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes. You know, and the proof is in the result. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=981.5s)]
*  But that's that's real. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=985.02s)]
*  If you could just force yourself into being enthusiastic about everything, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=986.22s)]
*  even shit you don't want to do, you got to do hill sprints. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=989.98s)]

*  Yes. That of a drudgery. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1000.74s)]
*  You know what it is to it's that thing where I think like you learn about, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1001.86s)]
*  especially when it comes to training and that that kind of thing, where it's either [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1005.3000000000001s)]

*  Like I get to do it, man. Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1016.1s)]
*  What a privilege this is. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1018.46s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of people out there that are seriously ill and injured [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1019.98s)]
*  and they can't do it. God, they would wish they'd fucking give anything [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1022.7s)]

*  And we are lucky. We're lucky as shit. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1027.8600000000001s)]

*  I would say that super lucky for sure. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1035.86s)]
*  And if you can just keep that in your mind, that's the problem. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1037.7s)]
*  People get just accustomed to whatever they have and then they want more. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1041.06s)]
*  They're not satisfied. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1045.66s)]
*  But gratitude is so important. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1046.86s)]
*  I know it's one of those hippie crystal fucking wooden beads, things that [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1049.74s)]

*  To the gratitude. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1056.5s)]
*  There's certain things that get co-opted by the like the word God, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1057.94s)]
*  I think, is the same way. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1061.54s)]
*  It's co-opted by some people and then people have this negative [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1062.8600000000001s)]
*  association with it. But I think gratitude is one of those. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1066.22s)]
*  It's it is real and it's really important. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1069.18s)]

*  But once I started realizing that a lot of the shit that I was [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1171.26s)]
*  trying to get after and there's the North Star, there's that thing, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1175.1399999999999s)]
*  whatever it is, it's always there. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1178.6599999999999s)]

*  you don't even enjoy it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1197.1799999999998s)]

*  I mean, that's another thing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1206.0200000000002s)]
*  You know, it's it's about the journey. Oh, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1207.3400000000001s)]

*  It's just hard when you're when you're when you're not where you want to be in life. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1215.3000000000002s)]
*  And if you listen to this and you just not satisfy with your position in life, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1218.94s)]
*  it's hard to think that way. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1223.7800000000002s)]
*  All you want is that thing. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1226.5800000000002s)]
*  But you got to somewhere along the line, figure out how to enjoy yourself [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1228.74s)]
*  somewhere along the line, figure out how to just go as hard as you can, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1234.5s)]
*  but also enjoy it, try to enjoy it, because [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1238.54s)]
*  that changes the whole tone of the experience. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1242.26s)]
*  And I think that makes you more successful. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1245.82s)]
*  I really do, because I think you have more energy, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1248.78s)]
*  you have more focus and you collect better energy around you from other people. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1251.82s)]
*  They they feel your energy. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1257.5s)]

*  and how you treat people and what you do and how you do things. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1262.94s)]
*  And they want to do a similar thing. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1266.34s)]
*  They want to do something that makes them feel that that way. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1268.7s)]
*  And they want other people to feel that way as well. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1271.46s)]
*  And it's got the butterfly effect. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1273.34s)]
*  It just it just goes through all the people that are around you. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1274.8999999999999s)]

*  And you're right. It has a butterfly effect. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1327.18s)]
*  It affects other people and it attracts other people. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1329.26s)]
*  Before you know it, everybody's vibrating at this great place [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1332.8200000000002s)]

*  And all of a sudden I had money like my whole life. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1362.3s)]
*  I was poor in my whole life. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1365.3s)]
*  I was like, wondering how I was going to when I was on my own. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1366.94s)]
*  And it was like, how am I paying the bills? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1369.94s)]
*  How am I eating? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1372.18s)]
*  You know, I remember like [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1373.5s)]
*  taking like a loose jar of change and counting it all out [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1375.38s)]
*  so I can go to Subway and get a sandwich, you know, like that kind of shit. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1378.54s)]
*  You don't forget that. You don't forget that kind of shit. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1381.62s)]
*  But then the moment I got that check, I remember feeling light. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1383.9s)]
*  Like like weight had been lifted off me. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1389.5s)]
*  Like now I didn't have to worry about my rent. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1391.66s)]
*  Now I didn't have to worry about food. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1393.5s)]
*  And I remember thinking immediately, oh, this is the key. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1395.5s)]
*  You just got to not get to a place where you're not worried about your bills. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1399.58s)]
*  If that means like spend less money, if that means like live a more prudent lifestyle, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1403.46s)]
*  whatever you have to do. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1407.98s)]
*  But get to that place where you're not worried about bills, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1409.14s)]
*  because that shit hanging over your head. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1412.06s)]
*  Yes. Causes stress that fucking ruins lives. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1413.74s)]
*  It ruins people. Yeah. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1417.14s)]
*  And so then I was like, OK, now the most important thing is fucking keep going. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1418.7s)]
*  Like make sure you don't lose any ground here and keep going. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1424.18s)]
*  Because now you know what it's like to be successful. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1429.1000000000001s)]
*  Continue that. Do whatever the fuck you have to do, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1431.8999999999999s)]
*  whatever work you have to put in to continue that. Yeah. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1435.06s)]
*  And then when I got to a place where I felt like I have enough money that I feel really secure, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1437.58s)]
*  then I started to learn how to be happy. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1443.22s)]
*  But in the beginning, it was just drive. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1445.5s)]
*  It was just all go. Yeah. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1447.6999999999998s)]
*  And it was just very selfish thinking. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1449.46s)]
*  You know, I'm just thinking only on what I'm trying to do. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1451.58s)]
*  But that's all we know. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1453.9399999999998s)]
*  But especially if you if you grow up broke [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1455.3s)]
*  and it's the thing that you make up your mind, I feel. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1459.14s)]
*  And it's the same thing that happened to me. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1462.1000000000001s)]
*  I made up my mind like I'm broke today, but one day I'm never going to be broke [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1463.54s)]
*  and I will never fucking go back to being broke. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1467.66s)]
*  And at least I'm going to do all I can. Yeah. Not to be broke. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1469.66s)]
*  So when you have that mentality, you have the blinders on. Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1472.22s)]
*  This is the way you're thinking. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1475.8600000000001s)]
*  This is until I think we get a little older and we achieve the success. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1477.14s)]
*  We understand that it starts to go like this a little bit. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1480.78s)]
*  I got to ask you something. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1484.5s)]
*  I heard this and I always wanted to confirm it with you. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1485.6200000000001s)]
*  You started early with martial arts. Yeah. Right. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1488.98s)]
*  And you said there was this great quote and it was something like [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1491.9s)]
*  it was martial arts, I think, that gave you the confidence [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1495.5s)]
*  to know that, oh, wait, I'm not going to be broke one day or something like that. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1499.98s)]
*  Is that right? Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1504.3400000000001s)]
*  Martial arts is the first thing that I realized like, oh, I'm not a loser. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1505.9s)]
*  Because I felt like I moved a lot when I was a kid. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1509.8200000000002s)]
*  We moved from New Jersey to San Francisco when I was seven. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1513.8200000000002s)]
*  Lived in San Francisco until I was 11. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1518.14s)]
*  Moved to Florida from 11 to 13. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1519.8600000000001s)]
*  Boston from 13 to 24. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1522.7s)]
*  So it was always. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1524.8600000000001s)]
*  I lived in 10 states by the time I was 13. Yeah. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1525.8200000000002s)]
*  Why were you guys moving around? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1528.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, my stepdad went to school in Florida. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1530.0200000000002s)]
*  Well, we moved to San Francisco just to like experience something different [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1535.74s)]
*  and just get away from New Jersey. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1539.26s)]
*  Moved there. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1541.74s)]
*  And then my stepdad went to school in Florida. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1542.5800000000002s)]
*  And when we went to school in Florida, we had to go to the University of Florida, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1546.1s)]
*  Gainesville. So we were there for three years. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1549.4199999999998s)]
*  And then when we moved to Boston, he was going to the Boston Architectural Center. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1552.02s)]
*  So we moved there so he could finish it and get his architectural degree. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1555.4199999999998s)]
*  So we were just always going where we had to go. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1558.8999999999999s)]
*  And when we did that, I would have to make a whole new set of friends. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1561.82s)]
*  And so it was this thing about being insecure and young. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1564.86s)]
*  And, you know, life is kind of fucked up and chaotic. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1569.1s)]
*  And you're, you know, you're meeting these new people and kids are fucking cruel. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1572.06s)]
*  And I, you know, I always was insecure because we're always moving around a lot. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1576.34s)]
*  And my life was kind of chaotic. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1581.3799999999999s)]
*  My family life is chaotic. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1583.06s)]
*  And I just felt like a loser. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1584.58s)]
*  I always felt like I just had to hide from people. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1587.74s)]
*  It was like socially nervous around people. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1590.2199999999998s)]
*  And I just felt like there were certain people that were winners in life. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1593.74s)]
*  And I was not that I was a loser. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1597.06s)]
*  And then I started doing martial arts and I got really good at it. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1599.1s)]
*  I was obsessed and I got really good at it really quickly. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1603.42s)]
*  And I realized, like, oh, I'm not a loser. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1606.66s)]
*  Like, I just have to find a thing and fucking really get after it in a way that I know [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1609.42s)]
*  some people that have had an easy life, they're not going to pursue it like it's [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1615.66s)]
*  going to save them. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1619.9s)]
*  And I was pursuing it like this is going to save me because I knew as I kept getting [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1621.18s)]
*  better, I started getting this feeling, oh, I'm good at something. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1625.38s)]
*  Like, I'm good at something dangerous. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1628.66s)]
*  And then I got really good at it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1630.54s)]
*  And then I started winning tournaments and competing and traveling all the road. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1631.94s)]
*  And so my whole life from 15 to 21 was just traveling around competing. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1635.3000000000002s)]
*  That's all I did. I was kind of it's kind of socially fucked up because I wasn't [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1640.46s)]
*  hanging out with many kids my age. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1645.46s)]
*  I wasn't really partying. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1647.5s)]
*  I wasn't doing training. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1648.8200000000002s)]
*  I was just training, competing, training, competing and teaching. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1649.8200000000002s)]
*  I was teaching at Boston University when I was 19 years old. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1652.3000000000002s)]
*  I was teaching an accredited course on Tuck window. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1655.22s)]
*  It was like pass, fail a, but it counted towards your GPA. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1657.02s)]
*  So I tell all the students, I'd say, listen, show up. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1660.42s)]
*  You get an A. That's all you have to do. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1663.8200000000002s)]
*  Show up and try. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1665.54s)]
*  You get an A. You don't have to be awesome at it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1666.46s)]
*  I just want you to just show up and do your best and you get an A. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1668.42s)]
*  It's that simple. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1670.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1671.9s)]
*  And so they knew that that counted towards their GPA. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1672.22s)]
*  So I had this big fucking class and it was great. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1674.46s)]
*  I did that for a couple of years. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1677.18s)]
*  And then when I started doing stand up, first of all, I started kickboxing. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1678.42s)]
*  And when I started kickboxing, that's when I started getting like brain damage. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1683.26s)]
*  And I was realizing I was getting brain damage. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1686.74s)]
*  We were sparring hard. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1688.94s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1690.42s)]
*  Like for real. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1691.1000000000001s)]
*  You were legit. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1691.78s)]
*  I was like laying in bed with headaches after sparring and there was no money in it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1693.9s)]
*  And I was like, what am I doing? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1698.6200000000001s)]
*  Like I'm 21. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1700.94s)]
*  What am I doing with my life? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1702.3400000000001s)]
*  Like I can't keep doing this. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1704.18s)]
*  And I had already started doing open mics. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1705.98s)]
*  So I had already started doing standup comedy, but I was kind of like just dabbling in it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1707.9s)]
*  I was, I thought I could do that too, but I was, I still had these competition aspirations. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1711.98s)]
*  And then the brain damage thing was scary because I knew quite a few people around me [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1718.34s)]
*  that from the time I was 16 until the time I was 21, I saw them deteriorate like noticeably [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1723.1799999999998s)]
*  slurring their words, forgetful, not knowing what you were talking about like moments ago. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1728.82s)]
*  And I knew that's coming. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1735.34s)]
*  And I knew that was coming for me. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1737.7399999999998s)]
*  And CTE back then wasn't in the conversation. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1738.9399999999998s)]
*  Like that wasn't in the lexicon, right? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1741.5s)]
*  The brain damage was people talk about people being punched, drunk. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1743.1s)]
*  And right. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1747.06s)]
*  But I knew too many people that I saw in them. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1747.7s)]
*  I saw a deterioration from young people. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1751.1399999999999s)]
*  I saw slurring in their words and they would have like one drink of alcohol and it'd be like they were [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1754.22s)]
*  hammered because something happens when people are punch drunk, when they drink, they just fall apart. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1758.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1764.58s)]
*  And I saw that too. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1765.02s)]
*  And I was like, okay, I got to stop doing this. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1766.34s)]
*  Like this is, this is dangerous because we weren't sparring smart. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1768.7s)]
*  We were going to war. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1772.74s)]
*  Like no head gear. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1773.42s)]
*  No, no head gear. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1774.74s)]
*  Sometimes head gear, most of the time, no head gear. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1776.06s)]
*  Most of the time was just going to war. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1778.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1779.58s)]
*  And you weren't really sparring. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1779.94s)]
*  You were fighting. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1781.46s)]
*  We were fighting all the time and just getting guys getting dropped all the time. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1782.1399999999999s)]
*  And that was just the kind of gym that I was in. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1786.54s)]
*  It was a hard ass fucking kickboxing gym and beat the fuck out of each other. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1788.06s)]
*  And, and I was realizing like, okay, I got to get out of this. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1792.06s)]
*  Like this is gonna, this is going to ruin me. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1795.4199999999998s)]
*  Like, and then if my mind gets ruined, my life is ruined because then you can't think, you can't do things. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1797.7s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you're doing in life. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1804.22s)]
*  You're it's like you literally everything is the quality of your ability to think. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1805.82s)]
*  And I knew that I was putting that in jeopardy. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1811.1799999999998s)]
*  So then I went all in in comedy, but I realized from martial arts that if I go all in on something, I could be successful at it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1813.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  Like that's the anchor. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1821.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1822.54s)]
*  You learn. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1823.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1823.9399999999998s)]
*  I thought that was cool, man. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1824.54s)]
*  When I read that. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1825.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, there's things in life that you get, man. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1826.1399999999999s)]
*  I think every kid should do something difficult, whether it's playing chess or whether it's soccer or whether it's wrestling. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1828.26s)]
*  Something that really fucking tests you because you learn that you can you can get better at stuff and you learn that you can overcome all those feelings of weakness that are inside. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1835.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1845.14s)]
*  And it acts as like a forcing mechanism for discipline. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1845.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1849.98s)]
*  And to work through that shit. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1850.38s)]
*  And also, I feel like it's like with you in martial arts and then transitioning over to comedy. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1851.78s)]
*  I feel like it also for me, it it forces also our kids to find their thing. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1856.86s)]
*  And even as you get a little older, you know, and use your teens and in your early 20s, because fuck dude, in my early 20s, I was still trying to figure out who I was and what I was going to be. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1864.74s)]
*  And even into my 30s. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1873.74s)]
*  But I feel like the as you're searching for that thing, it's like with me and football, like I thought football was my ticket. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1875.26s)]
*  That was the thing that's going to allow me to I'm going to buy my parents their first house. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1883.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1887.3799999999999s)]
*  Because I didn't live in a house until I was 27. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1888.54s)]
*  I was WWE champion was the first fucking house. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1890.3799999999999s)]
*  I lived there. It was amazing. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1892.86s)]
*  So I thought football was a ticket. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1894.8999999999999s)]
*  And then I realized down the road, like I have to finish this chapter in my life because I don't have that skill set to go on. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1897.3799999999999s)]
*  I could continue to push it and push it and push it. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1905.74s)]
*  But no, but like I was saying, it forces kids to as well and older kids as you get into adulthood to find your thing. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1907.86s)]
*  Right. Because a lot of times we're in the thing we think it's the thing. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1915.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1918.26s)]
*  And it's going to be our ticket out. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1920.06s)]
*  And if you can find one thing, you can find many. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1921.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1924.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1924.82s)]
*  It's like the Miyamoto Musashi quote. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1925.3s)]
*  Once you know the way broadly, you can see it in all things. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1927.5s)]
*  There's there's there's some real wisdom in those words because there's something about finding a pursuit or passion or something you truly love that's engaging and challenging that is exciting for you. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1931.3400000000001s)]
*  And it advances you as a person and the lessons that you learn in pursuing that thing you apply to everything in your life. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1946.3000000000002s)]
*  Everything in life. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1953.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1954.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1955.2600000000002s)]
*  Everything in life. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1955.8600000000001s)]
*  There's a great you probably know it. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1956.8600000000001s)]
*  Bruce Lee quote from Enter the Dragon. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1958.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you remember when he was like his it was the one of his students and he told the kid it's like a finger pointing away to the moon. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1960.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1967.26s)]
*  They slapped him in the head. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1968.26s)]
*  Don't concentrate on the finger. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1969.14s)]
*  You're going to lose all that heavenly glory around. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1970.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1972.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1973.5s)]
*  So back to being present. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1974.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1975.66s)]
*  Bruce Lee was a bad motherfucker. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1975.86s)]
*  Dude. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1977.54s)]
*  He was such a bad motherfucker. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1977.94s)]
*  People really don't appreciate what he did because what he did was introduce martial arts in an exciting way. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1979.18s)]
*  To the whole world. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1987.94s)]
*  Everybody was wearing kung fu outfits and everybody was fucking martial arts classes. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1989.8999999999999s)]
*  Everybody wanted to be like Bruce Lee. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1996.5s)]
*  He was the fucking coolest guy that ever existed in movies. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=1998.5s)]
*  All of a sudden you got this little ripped Chinese guy fucking everybody up. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2002.8999999999999s)]
*  And everyone thought they were Bruce Lee. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2007.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2008.94s)]
*  I remember getting my first pair of nunchucks. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2009.62s)]
*  But I had I fucked myself up with the real ones. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2012.66s)]
*  You got yourself in the back of the head. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2015.3s)]
*  Enough times that I was like oh they make rubber ones that you're supposed to learn with. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2016.78s)]
*  I did that. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2021.58s)]
*  And what did he do? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2022.62s)]
*  There was I feel like he was he was groundbreaking in a way right when he came over here. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2023.46s)]
*  There was something about what he was teaching. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2027.66s)]
*  Was it Jeet Kune Do? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2030.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2030.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2031.58s)]
*  So he was was he the first or he was taking a version of it. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2031.74s)]
*  Well he was the first to combine. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2035.42s)]
*  The thing was there was the thing about loyalty in martial arts. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2037.98s)]
*  Like if you were a judo practitioner and you started training at a kickboxing gym people would frown upon that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2041.5s)]
*  Like they why are you training Muay Thai when you're a judo practitioner. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2047.02s)]
*  Judo is the way. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2050.78s)]
*  And the same thing was I had a very open minded Taekwondo coach and who actually encouraged me to start boxing and doing some other things. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2052.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2058.38s)]
*  But most of the time that's not the case. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2058.98s)]
*  A lot of like kung fu practitioners they don't want you practicing karate. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2061.54s)]
*  They only want you going to a kung fu place. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2065.5s)]
*  What Bruce Lee said is use everything that's useful. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2067.9s)]
*  Everything that's useful. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2070.7000000000003s)]
*  And he put together a system of martial arts and incorporated everything that he learned from grappling from Jean LaBelle and karate from Chuck Norris and Tang Soo Do and you know kung fu from Yip Man from Wing Chung. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2071.7000000000003s)]
*  He put it all together with Western boxing and wrestling. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2085.82s)]
*  He realized like there's so many different ways to fight and the style is having no style. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2088.98s)]
*  The way is no way like figuring out. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2096.6600000000003s)]
*  He said that. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2098.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2099.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2099.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2100.3s)]
*  Figuring out how to adapt and move to every situation to be like water. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2100.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2105.7s)]
*  And be formless. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2106.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2107.34s)]
*  And that's right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2107.82s)]
*  And he taught that philosophy and that philosophy eventually became mixed martial arts. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2108.54s)]
*  Bruce Lee was the first true mixed martial artist because he was the first like true guru that was shouting it from the top of the hills to use everything that's useful. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2115.38s)]
*  Everything. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2125.82s)]
*  And from all styles. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2126.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2127.9s)]
*  And put it together. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2128.06s)]
*  But back then that was really frowned upon. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2128.7s)]
*  Really it was like kind of dangerous. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2130.98s)]
*  Like people would go after you if you disrespected kung fu. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2132.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2136.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2136.74s)]
*  To prove you either prove. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2137.06s)]
*  So not only try to prove you wrong but like physically try and go. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2138.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2141.06s)]
*  You were disrespecting their art which was like literally like a religion to a lot of people. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2141.82s)]
*  Martial arts are very cult like. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2147.46s)]
*  And when you get into a martial arts school that a lot of times the instructor is almost like a cult leader. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2149.46s)]
*  Do you think that person is invincible. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2157.5s)]
*  They can't be beaten by anyone. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2159.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2161.1s)]
*  You know you have these like weird ideas about your master. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2161.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2164.26s)]
*  I mean even call them a master. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2164.46s)]
*  You know and so there's this like very rigid thinking that used to exist. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2166.54s)]
*  But not anymore. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2171.1800000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2172.38s)]
*  There's no. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2173.1800000000003s)]

*  Referential to the master or. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2174.5s)]
*  No. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2176.46s)]
*  The UFC just fucking put that away. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2176.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2179.06s)]
*  Like there's still schools out there that run like that but they're not legitimate and they're not the good ones. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2179.3s)]
*  The really good schools. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2185.2200000000003s)]
*  They they're just teaching you something beautiful. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2186.78s)]
*  They're teaching you how to use your body in a way that is is challenging and effective. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2190.26s)]
*  And it makes you so much more confident and it makes you if a physical altercation happens you have a massive advantage over almost anyone. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2197.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2205.6200000000003s)]
*  Protect yourself. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2206.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2206.9s)]
*  It's literally like a superpower to have that and to walk around to know that most people have zero idea how to fight. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2207.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2212.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2212.78s)]
*  And so you've all seen these fucking Instagram videos of guys have no idea how to fight and they're fighting each other and they don't even know each other and they're swinging just swinging for the fences. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2213.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2221.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean something connects. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2221.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2222.74s)]
*  I mean if you're a trained fighter that looks hilarious. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2223.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2225.66s)]
*  It's like oh this is what are you doing. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2225.94s)]
*  Stop stop for a second. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2229.02s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2230.2599999999998s)]
*  It around like dude you're gonna get hurt here. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2230.66s)]
*  Like stop. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2232.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2233.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2234.02s)]
*  What when was the last time you got into a fight. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2234.46s)]
*  I never really got in fights. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2237.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean I got in like one or two in high school. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2238.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2240.62s)]
*  But I once I started training I was just competing all the time. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2240.86s)]
*  I never got into like street fights. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2243.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2245.38s)]
*  And they're stupid. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2245.98s)]
*  They're stupid. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2247.42s)]
*  They're so stupid and stupid. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2248.1000000000004s)]
*  Just like it's just your ego that keeps you there. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2249.42s)]
*  If it's one thing if you have to defend yourself someone's attacking you. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2251.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2254.5800000000004s)]
*  Or something's danger or someone's attacking someone you love. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2254.82s)]
*  But to just get into fights because you know how to fight is so crazy because like you think oh if I could do what you do I'd be beating the fuck out of people. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2257.2200000000003s)]
*  No you wouldn't because they'll shoot you. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2264.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2266.5s)]
*  Come back with a gun and fucking shoot you. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2266.94s)]
*  You think people just like getting head kicked. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2269.46s)]
*  No they're going to fuck you up man. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2271.18s)]
*  What are you going to look over your shoulder the rest of your life. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2273.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2275.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2276.1s)]
*  No you can't do that. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2276.42s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2278.06s)]
*  That's fucking silly. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2279.14s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2280.1s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2281.2999999999997s)]
*  But also that's people that haven't trained. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2281.94s)]
*  They don't understand that like. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2284.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2285.58s)]
*  But I tell people like the best way to stop bullying it sounds so counterintuitive. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2286.06s)]
*  Teach people how to fight when they're young. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2291.14s)]
*  Teach bullies even how to fight. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2293.3799999999997s)]
*  They won't be doing that. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2295.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2296.22s)]
*  Because they in a way inherently have a respect. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2296.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2299.2999999999997s)]
*  They're insecure. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2299.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2300.7s)]
*  The reason why they're imposing their strength on other people and trying to make people feel bad is because they feel bad and they want they think somehow or another by being a piece of shit to someone who's smaller than them that somehow or another that boosts them up. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2301.14s)]
*  But it doesn't it just gives you like you have low self esteem you can't think of yourself as like a hero if that's the kind of life you're living. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2313.18s)]
*  It's a terrible way to live. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2318.94s)]
*  It is. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2320.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2320.74s)]
*  And they don't. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2321.14s)]
*  But people don't understand that the way to cure that is not to like just simply punish them. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2323.06s)]
*  The way to cure that is to teach everyone how to fight. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2329.02s)]
*  Like it should be a thing that men learn and I think some women too. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2332.38s)]
*  Like not mandatory. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2335.78s)]
*  I'm not saying everyone should have to do this but it should be an option available to you. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2338.02s)]
*  And if that option is available to you and you take it I think it'll better your life. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2341.54s)]
*  And I think it'll stop a lot of this bullying. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2345.22s)]
*  I really do. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2347.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2348.58s)]
*  And the spirit of learning how to protect yourself right in that anchor of learning how to protect yourself and then learning how to fight learning how to throw a punch knowing how to do this do this. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2349.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2359.1800000000003s)]
*  You you also learn the value in difficult work and getting better at things and some people never learn that they never learn that. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2360.26s)]
*  I mean that that's a whole idea about training really fucking hard. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2369.06s)]
*  You know the value of putting in that hard work early early. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2374.34s)]
*  I always tell athletes and I know you feel the same way. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2377.38s)]
*  It's like the whether you're on the football field basketball court in the cage whatever it is that you do whatever kind of athletics it always always starts in the gym. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2379.54s)]
*  And once you're done and you're playing days are over fighting days are over wrestling days are over you go back to the gym. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2389.6600000000003s)]
*  It all starts in the gym. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2395.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2396.82s)]
*  That hard work you put in. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2397.1800000000003s)]
*  You just have to keep your body healthy if you don't if you can. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2398.7400000000002s)]
*  If you can't keep your body healthy I understand. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2402.1800000000003s)]
*  But if you can you've got to do it. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2404.14s)]
*  It's something everyone should do. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2406.9s)]
*  It makes your life better. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2409.02s)]
*  It just does. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2411.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2411.86s)]
*  You know and there's so many intelligent people that I know that ignore their body because they're so concentrated on their mind. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2412.42s)]
*  They're so concentrated on intellectual pursuits that they let their body become just a wreck. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2418.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2423.8199999999997s)]
*  A physical wreck. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2424.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2425.02s)]
*  We only got one man. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2425.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah it's frail. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2426.74s)]
*  Only got one body. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2427.66s)]
*  Your intellectual energy is dependent upon your physical energy. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2429.46s)]
*  If you're if your body's tired your brain's not going to function as well. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2432.5s)]
*  Even if you have an amazing brain. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2435.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2437.18s)]
*  You're not giving it what it needs. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2438.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2439.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2440.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2440.66s)]
*  I agree. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2441.02s)]
*  And it's also the best way to filter out the noise of life. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2441.7s)]
*  Like if you choose to do something that's much harder than anything else you can experience and it's voluntary. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2446.1s)]
*  The rest of life is easier. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2452.66s)]
*  It really is easier. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2454.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2455.9s)]
*  Stress and bullshit and criticism and fucking haggling and nonsense and chaos. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2456.26s)]
*  Like you can get through that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2461.58s)]
*  Especially today. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2463.8199999999997s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2465.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2465.86s)]
*  There's so much fucking noise. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2466.06s)]
*  So much noise. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2468.42s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2469.46s)]
*  So much bullshit. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2470.46s)]
*  Toxicity. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2471.2999999999997s)]
*  So much toxicity. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2472.42s)]
*  So it's just out there all the time. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2473.42s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2475.22s)]
*  It's the kind of that kind of anchoring balance and training gives you the leg up to swat the bullshit away. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2475.98s)]
*  Swat the bullshit away. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2482.42s)]
*  The bullshit today is fascinating because it's social media bullshit. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2483.62s)]
*  It's a different bullshit than people have ever experienced in all of human history. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2487.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2491.82s)]
*  These people that you don't know chiming in about everything. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2492.3s)]
*  The good part of that is there's a sharing of ideas and there's a way of communicating that never existed before. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2497.06s)]
*  And people are learning so much more about things than ever before. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2505.98s)]
*  Social media allows people to break news stories long before mainstream media. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2509.38s)]
*  It allows people to tell you about fascinating stories that maybe you would have never heard of and amazing archaeological discoveries and scientific advancements. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2514.46s)]
*  And it's incredible in that regard. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2524.5s)]
*  But it's also you're dealing with human beings in a weird form where they're not in front of you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2526.6600000000003s)]
*  They're not talking to you eye to eye. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2532.98s)]
*  They can say the shittiest things and they don't feel anything. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2535.1000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2538.46s)]
*  And they're trying to hurt people's feelings and they make it like an activity. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2538.78s)]
*  Their activity is not jujitsu. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2543.42s)]
*  Their activity is like shitting on people online start in trouble. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2545.54s)]
*  That's the trend. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2549.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2550.38s)]
*  That it's just to shit on everything. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2550.94s)]
*  But yeah you're right. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2553.06s)]
*  I want to back up for a second because it's so important that people hear this too as well. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2554.02s)]
*  I think especially coming from you and I are kind of in the public eye and we deal with the shit and the noise and all that. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2557.5s)]
*  But we also deal with the good stuff. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2562.3s)]
*  And like you were saying and I am an optimist I think in my DNA. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2563.7000000000003s)]
*  So I like to look and search for the good stuff that's out there the stuff that's going to make me better help me stretch out my aperture up here looking at things like oh I never looked at it like that. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2568.34s)]
*  Thank you for bringing that up. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2579.1400000000003s)]
*  That's great. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2580.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know if I agree but let's talk a little bit more compared to the ones who the experts toxicity. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2581.1000000000004s)]
*  And it's this interesting thing that some people have to. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2586.98s)]
*  I'm going to go out of my way to try and make you feel bad. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2591.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2595.6600000000003s)]
*  And make people feel bad shit on this whole thing and really not offer anything I think constructive. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2596.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2601.22s)]
*  You know that we can talk about and chop up. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2601.58s)]
*  Well it's almost all damaged people. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2604.18s)]
*  And the problem is yes a good percentage of the people out there are damaged. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2607.02s)]
*  And there's a thing about the kind of fucking interaction that people have on social media that just makes their life worse whether they realize it or not. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2613.42s)]
*  Just fills their life with anxiety and this weird need to constantly check see who responded to what you tweeted and what are the comments on your Facebook post and reading them all. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2623.62s)]
*  And you're not living your life. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2638.18s)]
*  You're just wrapped up in this weird battle of opinions with strangers. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2640.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2645.94s)]
*  You know when you see people defending themselves online like I have done this and I've done that. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2646.54s)]
*  What are you doing. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2651.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2651.94s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2652.58s)]
*  You argue with some fucking 15 year old troll who's in a basement who's hiding from his stepdad. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2654.86s)]
*  Like what are you doing. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2660.22s)]
*  And you know what I always love is the tap typing in all capital letters as if somebody is yelling and the how dare you and this. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2661.46s)]
*  What the fuck. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2670.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2671.86s)]
*  Well it's a sport. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2672.66s)]
*  It's a sport and trying to get the best response and there's skill to it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2673.9s)]
*  You know the skill to shitting on people and learning how to like go after people like it's just it is a kind of a game. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2679.02s)]
*  You're trying to like zing them and then you look at the comments and everybody's agreeing with you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2684.78s)]
*  Yeah yeah get them. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2688.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2689.82s)]
*  It's like living in that in the just the clickbait culture you know and want to raise the profile. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2690.18s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2697.26s)]
*  And this is something you and I were texting about last week is is how can you tell the difference between the bullshit noise and the toxicity that's always out there. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2698.82s)]
*  Compared to. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2709.14s)]
*  Oh that's an opinion that is worthy of my attention. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2710.26s)]
*  I just want to look at and look at this for a second. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2713.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2715.7s)]
*  How do you differentiate the two. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2715.94s)]
*  It's difficult right. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2718.54s)]
*  You got to try to be objective and you got to try to be unemotional when you read something that someone's writing like say if someone's like Palestine and Israel is a great example. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2719.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2729.7400000000002s)]
*  Because it's the tension is so heightened and anything you say on one side or the other people will attack you on. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2730.06s)]
*  And so this is one that's if you have an opinion a political opinion a cultural opinion about the conflict and you post it. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2737.98s)]
*  Boy you are opening yourself up to a world of people agreeing and disagreeing and chaos and fighting. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2746.42s)]
*  And some of those people are going to have points that make sense like say if you are 100 percent pro Palestine and you read something about Hamas and you read something. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2754.3s)]
*  Wow that's fucking terrible. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2765.46s)]
*  You know you have to be willing to say oh there's both things. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2767.5s)]
*  There's the you know the the fact that they live in what's essentially an open air prison is fucking terrible. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2770.78s)]
*  Also the people that are ruling them are terrorists. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2777.54s)]
*  That's terrible too. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2781.5s)]
*  Like you can't ignore any aspect. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2782.34s)]
*  This is a complicated thing. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2785.42s)]
*  What some of the Israeli soldiers have done some evil things to Palestine. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2787.46s)]
*  There's videos of them shooting people. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2791.14s)]
*  Also what Hamas did is fucking insanely evil. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2793.94s)]
*  Like what what has to be done to fix that. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2797.54s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2801.1s)]
*  But to pretend it's binary and to pretend it's one side good one side bad that seems insane. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2802.42s)]
*  It's it's all bad. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2808.3s)]
*  It's all bad. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2809.9s)]
*  It's all fucking heartbreaking. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2810.58s)]
*  Yeah it's all devastating. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2812.66s)]
*  And you're right there's and what I've learned I feel like we've all learned or trying to learn at least is because it is so complicated. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2814.18s)]
*  That is a part of the world and historically thousands of years that I find complicated and I try my best to understand. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2821.9s)]
*  I also try to go out with an open mind because it is all fucking crazy. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2829.6200000000003s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2834.38s)]
*  Yeah it doesn't seem like there's a real solution either. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2835.06s)]
*  And there's the things that you said. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2837.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2839.02s)]
*  And I want to get to that in a second because I was thinking about that today is the everything you said. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2839.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2844.54s)]
*  This part of it is devastating. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2845.38s)]
*  This is devastating. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2847.34s)]
*  This side this side. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2848.3s)]
*  The 240 hostages that still haven't come home yet. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2849.66s)]
*  But also where does it go. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2854.26s)]
*  Right. Where does it go. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2856.94s)]
*  Where does it go. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2858.1s)]
*  That's the that's the thing that I think really grabs my attention because usually I think in. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2858.86s)]
*  I'm not saying a situation like this but there's a lot of stuff that goes on where you feel like I think this is the path to finding a resolve. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2864.94s)]
*  Or at least maybe the first steps of resolve. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2874.94s)]
*  But in this case. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2876.46s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2877.38s)]
*  Brother I don't know. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2878.1s)]
*  No I don't see it. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2878.94s)]
*  But I but but speaking to what we were talking about earlier you can learn from that. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2879.9s)]
*  That's where separating the noise from the intelligent perspectives I've read some very intelligent perspective so people give you a detailed history in the conflict of the region. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2886.22s)]
*  And you realize like oh this is like incredibly complicated. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2897.06s)]
*  And to have a binary viewpoint or a very black or white viewpoint is dangerous. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2900.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2904.98s)]
*  And it's so easy for people to do. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2905.46s)]
*  People love to do that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2907.06s)]
*  They love to other people. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2908.54s)]
*  It's a natural human trait. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2910.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a tribal trait that we have. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2911.9s)]
*  And that is what led to World War 2 and the fucking the Holocaust is that they othered these human beings because these human beings were Jewish. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2913.86s)]
*  And you're seeing people doing that now with Jewish people and you're seeing people doing that now with with with Muslim people. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2922.5s)]
*  There's people that are angry at all Muslim people because of what Hamas did. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2930.06s)]
*  All of it's crazy. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2933.94s)]
*  And you you what we need to do is realize that othering human beings is insane. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2935.38s)]
*  And if you could look at Earth from space this one of the things that all the astronauts have said all the people that have gone to the space station there's a moment where you are up there when you look down at the earth. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2945.3s)]
*  And you see this magical thing that's floating in the heavens and you realize how insane these conflicts we have over territory of lines in the dirt and fighting over resources. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2959.14s)]
*  And it's so ridiculous. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2971.94s)]
*  We are one life form. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2974.58s)]
*  We are one gigantic super organism that needs each other because like yes human beings are so powerful. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2978.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2987.3399999999997s)]
*  Human beings need each other. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2987.8199999999997s)]
*  We do not survive alone. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2989.7s)]
*  The worst thing they can do to you in prison is put you in solitary confinement. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2991.5s)]
*  We need each other. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2994.74s)]
*  It's a part of what we are. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2996.06s)]
*  We're this one gigantic group of beings that are trying to live our lives all together on this fucking magical thing that's floating through space. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=2997.58s)]
*  And we unfortunately come from tribal backgrounds. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3011.18s)]
*  All of us. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3015.62s)]
*  We evolved in these small groups of hunter gatherers thousands and thousands of years ago and we carry that DNA still. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3016.7s)]
*  We carry that fiercely loyal tribal DNA that allows us to look at people that aren't a part of us as something less than us. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3023.3799999999997s)]
*  And we've got other them. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3032.18s)]
*  Yeah. And what I'm hoping is that as technology allows people to communicate far more freely and to translate languages more freely and or information is going to get exchanged more freely and it takes long time for this to happen. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3033.54s)]
*  But we'll eventually understand each other to the point where that's way more difficult to happen because it's so easy for it to happen if you don't speak their language you don't follow their religion. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3048.1800000000003s)]
*  They're bad. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3059.38s)]
*  You're good. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3060.3s)]
*  You know and then you're othering people. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3061.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3063.2999999999997s)]
*  And we've got to stop that. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3064.14s)]
*  That's that's a fucking insanely ridiculous thing that's being done by world leaders. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3065.62s)]
*  They gather people together against other people that you don't even fucking know. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3070.9s)]
*  You don't even know. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3076.1s)]
*  It's one thing if you have a conflict with an actual human being that's like doing something to you. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3076.74s)]
*  This is like you don't even know these people and these world leaders have told you that somehow these people are bad and you're good and we got to go over there and fuck them up like we're still doing that. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3080.66s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3091.46s)]
*  It's insane that human beings are still doing that. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3092.7000000000003s)]
*  And I'm hoping that as we get to know each other more through technology and through what has become the most connecting innovation the most connecting technology ever which is the Internet. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3094.58s)]
*  I'm hoping that's going to continue to evolve and connect people further and further. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3111.46s)]
*  The problem is if it along the way it can get co-opted by governments and it can get controlled and censored and that's the enemy. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3115.98s)]
*  That's the enemy of all truth. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3123.94s)]
*  That's what we can't have. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3125.1s)]
*  We can't have that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3126.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3127.1s)]
*  We need to fucking ride this out and let this thing ride itself out and figure out the right way to live. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3127.5s)]
*  But it's definitely not after war. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3134.7400000000002s)]
*  I look I I feel like I agree with you on that. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3136.14s)]
*  My hope was in the spirit of vein of what you were saying is that riding it out getting more information being open to difference of opinion. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3140.54s)]
*  Here's how I feel. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3152.58s)]
*  How do you feel. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3153.34s)]
*  But tell me truly tell me a little bit more just so I can understand it. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3153.94s)]
*  But even in that the spirit of that I feel like you get so much more out of that so much benefit. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3157.3s)]
*  But I look I feel like like you were saying we have to things got to get recalibrated man. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3162.18s)]
*  And I don't know especially over there I don't know what the end game is there. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3167.5s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3171.62s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3172.46s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3173.9s)]
*  It's terrifying because it can lead the whole world into nuclear conflict and then civilizations over. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3174.8199999999997s)]
*  And then we're back to caveman if we're lucky. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3180.2599999999998s)]
*  If we're lucky if there's anybody left. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3182.58s)]
*  I mean that's there's a real possibility we can nuke the whole world and there's no one left. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3184.42s)]
*  And maybe some people living on islands on where they got lucky. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3188.42s)]
*  Well what's crazy is that is a possibility. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3191.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3194.14s)]
*  And that's what's happened before. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3194.54s)]
*  Fucking wild. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3195.9s)]
*  Well the thing is it's happened before with natural disasters. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3196.74s)]
*  There was this. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3199.06s)]
*  What was that super volcano was a Toba. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3200.26s)]
*  Was that what it was. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3202.3s)]
*  Yeah the Toba super volcano 70000 years ago that reduced the entire human population to a few thousand people. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3202.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3209.3s)]
*  Yeah we came that close from a super volcano 70000 years ago to being down to like very few people. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3210.06s)]
*  They don't even know how many people it was. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3217.02s)]
*  But the estimates are a few thousand I think. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3218.54s)]
*  Is that what the estimates are. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3220.62s)]
*  See with it. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3221.74s)]
*  I think that's what they think. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3222.38s)]
*  But that's great. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3223.62s)]
*  A few thousand people is nothing. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3224.5s)]
*  Like how. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3226.18s)]
*  That's nothing. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3227.58s)]
*  That's a concert. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3228.34s)]
*  That's like a concert like a theater. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3229.42s)]
*  Not even a fucking big show. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3232.62s)]
*  My first wrestling match. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3234.18s)]
*  And then imagine that's the whole human race on planet Earth. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3236.38s)]
*  And then you're dealing with. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3239.26s)]
*  Back then of course you're dealing with predators. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3240.42s)]
*  You're dealing with natural disasters and even normal shit like freezing to death in the winter and starving. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3242.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3248.34s)]
*  You know. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3249.02s)]
*  And if you're dealing with a super volcano disease. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3249.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3251.62s)]
*  You have also as a nuclear winter super volcano coats the earth in ash and it's one of the things that kills everybody is the temperature drops. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3252.1400000000003s)]
*  No sunlight gets through plants don't grow. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3259.1s)]
*  Everything's fucked. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3261.38s)]
*  And then you know you're cannibalizing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3262.6200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3264.82s)]
*  I mean there's a high possibility that our ancestors were cannibals and that the people that had to survive through a lot of these things they probably ate people did what they had to do. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3266.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3275.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3276.1s)]
*  Did what they had to do. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3276.6200000000003s)]
*  Which is fucked. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3277.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3278.3s)]
*  I always I'd start with my quad. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3279.58s)]
*  It's a lot of meat on that thing. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3283.66s)]
*  Yours too. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3285.54s)]
*  I don't think I'd eat myself. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3286.7799999999997s)]
*  I'd probably jump off a cliff. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3288.74s)]
*  You know that's the thing is like you know people it's it's a scary thing what people resort to like the Donner party. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3290.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3298.38s)]
*  You know when those people got trapped trying to make the way across the mountains it's terrifying. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3298.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3303.66s)]
*  When you're realizing you're starving people are like trying to draw straws. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3304.2200000000003s)]
*  Who's going to kill who to eat. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3307.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3309.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3309.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3310.86s)]
*  You know you said you talked about the. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3311.06s)]
*  Who was it the astrophysicist you said when we talk about. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3316.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3319.14s)]
*  NASA the scientists when they look up there's. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3319.7000000000003s)]
*  There's an overview of. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3322.98s)]
*  Look. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3323.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3324.7000000000003s)]
*  It has that emotional impact. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3324.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3326.9s)]
*  It really puts things into perspective. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3327.58s)]
*  How we're just on this spinning thing. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3330.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3331.86s)]
*  We all do need each other. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3332.1800000000003s)]
*  I always like to say too because I feel like it connects to what you said which is try to keep in mind history is always watching. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3333.78s)]
*  And when you think the decisions we make today years from now history is going to look back at this time. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3340.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3346.38s)]
*  And I think if you really think like that it kind of it just helps force another forcing mechanism to try and make the best decision possible. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3347.02s)]
*  At least I try to think that way. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3354.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3356.38s)]
*  History is always watching man. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3356.66s)]
*  But we have the benefit of living a good life while this is happening. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3358.3s)]
*  Imagine being someone trapped in Palestine and imagine being someone trapped in Gaza while they're bombing. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3362.5s)]
*  And this idea is that they're supposed to get rid of mosque. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3368.2200000000003s)]
*  How they get they have no food. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3370.94s)]
*  They have no money. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3372.42s)]
*  They have bad water. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3373.1s)]
*  Like what are you talking about. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3373.98s)]
*  Like what are they going to do. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3374.86s)]
*  They're they're they're occupied too. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3376.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3378.02s)]
*  They're occupied by whoever's leading them. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3378.3s)]
*  You know when you're deeply impoverished and there's no way and you're literally like trapped in this one place you can't even leave. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3381.34s)]
*  What what are your options. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3388.7400000000002s)]
*  Saying that they need to rise up and organize like they're going to get killed. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3390.3s)]
*  Do you understand how that works over there. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3393.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not that simple. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3395.5800000000004s)]
*  No that's the thing. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3396.6600000000003s)]
*  That's why I go back to where's the wise brains here in open hands who is what's the resolve. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3398.1000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3407.38s)]
*  What's the beginning of it. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3407.78s)]
*  At least you know I haven't heard anyone have like a solution that really makes sense that I think is workable that they could actually pull off. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3408.7000000000003s)]
*  I think before October 7th you know there probably would have you could have had options right. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3417.34s)]
*  But after that it's like God is the Israelis are so bloodthirsty and now these the people that are like the free Palestine people are bloodthirsty. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3423.7000000000003s)]
*  And you see anti-Semitism everywhere now a level that I never saw before open anti-Semitism online open anti-Semitism people challenging chanting death to the Jews openly in public. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3431.82s)]
*  It's crazy to see. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3445.2999999999997s)]
*  It's crazy to see. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3447.7799999999997s)]
*  Never. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3449.46s)]
*  Yeah it's it's so wild. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3450.22s)]
*  And you would imagine that in this day and age in 2023 we would be moving away from away from all that. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3453.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3460.22s)]
*  But to see it ramped up in our lifetime is so insane because that's why it concerns me though right. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3460.9s)]
*  And I know you too and a lot of people out there like where does that go. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3466.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3470.2599999999998s)]
*  Where does this escalate to. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3470.9s)]
*  Yeah not a good place. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3472.58s)]
*  No. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3473.86s)]
*  And then where is that person human group who's going to come in and say let's. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3474.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3482.5s)]
*  Try this. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3483.1800000000003s)]
*  And how do we do that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3483.78s)]
*  Does it does something tragic really tragic not anything that's already happened has been horrifically tragic but something horrific at a large scale has to happen that really wakes people up like a nuclear bomb hitting a city. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3484.94s)]
*  And people go Jesus Christ. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3498.3s)]
*  Like we went from 1945 until today and without doing that if we do that now and then they retaliate and then that and then it's over. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3500.46s)]
*  Then we're fucked. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3508.42s)]
*  I hope that's not the case brother. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3509.06s)]
*  I hope it's not the case too but sometimes I think something has to happen to wake people up and like one of the shake and recalibrate everything 9 11 did that. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3511.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3519.82s)]
*  Like you remember after 9 11 everybody had those American flags on their car even in L.A. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3520.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3524.2200000000003s)]
*  Which is you know super liberal and they never would put a fucking American flag on their car. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3524.66s)]
*  Everybody had them on it galvanized. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3529.26s)]
*  Yeah brought us together brought us together and it made people realize like hey we are literally a country. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3531.1s)]
*  We're all in this together and without that conflict I think people start looking for conflict amongst the people that are around them. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3536.9s)]
*  I think human beings unfortunately have a natural desire to seek out conflict or to embrace conflict or to be a part of conflict and you know and to go after people's opinions don't align with theirs. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3543.34s)]
*  And you know if there's no real problem in the world you find problems. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3558.42s)]
*  It's like that expression like the worst thing that's ever happened to you is the worst thing that's ever happened. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3563.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3567.42s)]
*  If it's daddy taking away your Rolls Royce because you drove drunk when you're 16 that's still the worst thing that's ever happened to you. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3567.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3574.7799999999997s)]
*  But if your life has been this fucking chaotic system of foster homes and drug addicted family members and crime and then and then you get free something that would drive someone up a wall won't affect you at all. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3575.3399999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3590.2999999999997s)]
*  Because you've been through so much. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3590.7s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3592.1s)]
*  And I think unfortunately there's a lot of people in this life in this world that we live in especially in America that live soft ass lives. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3592.78s)]
*  And they don't encounter real hardship. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3602.46s)]
*  They encounter like kind of like minor league hardship that they have blown up to be the end of the world. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3604.7000000000003s)]
*  It's not the hardcore shit that really shapes you. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3612.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3614.58s)]
*  A lot of people need. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3615.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3616.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3617.06s)]
*  I agree. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3617.66s)]
*  It's just we're going through a very strange adolescence as a species and we're going through this like teenage process of like fucking up and figuring out who you are with nuclear weapons. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3618.7799999999997s)]
*  And like if you looked at the actual civilization on earth itself the human civilization it's going through this chaotic period of trying to grow and get better while also engaging in ridiculous conflict. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3633.42s)]
*  And it's all happening in the blink of an eye. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3650.3s)]
*  It's happening so rapidly. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3654.2200000000003s)]
*  Things have changed so quickly from the time you and I were kids. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3655.78s)]
*  I mean when you were our kids it was Russia. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3659.78s)]
*  Everybody was worried about going to war with Russia. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3661.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3663.2999999999997s)]
*  And then when the fall of the Soviet Union there was just like ah it's calm that went through the whole country. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3663.74s)]
*  The breath. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3668.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3669.54s)]
*  I thought we were done. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3669.74s)]
*  I thought oh we're done with all this. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3670.7799999999997s)]
*  This is great. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3672.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3673.14s)]
*  We figured this out. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3673.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3674.38s)]
*  But no. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3674.7799999999997s)]
*  Well that's why I wonder what where where are the call for leaders you know like where. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3676.18s)]
*  I mean it's a big question but. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3683.54s)]
*  Well nobody really wants to be president. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3684.9s)]
*  Fucking crawl up your ass with a microscope. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3686.54s)]
*  Dude. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3689.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not fun. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3689.5s)]
*  They talked about you being president. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3690.98s)]
*  I know. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3692.5s)]
*  I remember one point in time it was like they were saying it should be the rock and Oprah. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3693.3s)]
*  They should be president and vice president. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3698.58s)]
*  Dude so one of the parties came to visit me. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3700.98s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3703.54s)]
*  At the end of last year. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3704.22s)]
*  Asking for me to run. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3707.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3709.62s)]
*  I mean it was. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3711.1s)]
*  For president? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3711.78s)]
*  For president. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3712.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3713.5s)]
*  It was first of all incredibly fucking surreal. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3714.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3717.9s)]
*  Because I was the guy you know who was wrestling in flea markets. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3718.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3721.54s)]
*  Years ago looking for free corn dogs and hot dogs and shit. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3721.9s)]
*  Selling my headshots for five bucks trying to make money and then all of a sudden I'm [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3725.98s)]
*  having that conversation. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3729.62s)]
*  But it was just incredibly surreal and so wild but also so incredible that they had [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3731.1s)]
*  all this data that would that they had said if this happens here's the result. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3736.5s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3743.02s)]
*  It was really fucking deep. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3743.58s)]
*  And then I started to think again surreal because that's never been my goal. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3745.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3750.38s)]
*  I appreciate it and I'm fucking honored. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3751.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3753.82s)]
*  Like you in here in our core. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3755.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3757.7000000000003s)]
*  But it made me think it's either this is this is an incredible thing and I got some [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3758.1s)]
*  pretty decent leadership skills or things are so fucked up. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3767.86s)]
*  They're turning to the pro wrestler movie star. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3776.38s)]
*  Try to run the world. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3778.94s)]
*  Man. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3780.02s)]
*  But who are those you know leaders whether president or not but I just I wait for as [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3781.58s)]
*  it relates to the conflict. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3786.78s)]
*  They're like who's who's not necessarily step up but just information as you were [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3788.26s)]
*  talking about we live in this time with incredible technology and communicate so fast [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3792.82s)]
*  and you could be as open as your aperture stretches out to be and you could get as [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3797.62s)]
*  much information as you can. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3802.02s)]
*  So where are those. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3804.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3806.5s)]
*  People who are going to. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3806.82s)]
*  They don't want to be president. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3808.34s)]
*  They they're running their own lives and they you know they're looking on the sideline [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3809.6600000000003s)]
*  and wishing that someone with real real leadership skills and real wisdom and real [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3813.38s)]
*  empathy and a real moral compass who's not governed entirely by money. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3819.06s)]
*  Well you just said it. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3824.42s)]
*  I mean those things empathy. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3825.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3827.46s)]
*  You know that's those kind of qualities integrity. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3827.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3830.6200000000003s)]
*  Especially the empathy part. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3831.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3832.5s)]
*  And looking at everything as open. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3833.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3835.58s)]
*  You know but if you're a person that has empathy how do you conduct a drone strike [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3836.02s)]
*  where you know that a certain amount of civilians 100 percent are going to die but [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3841.62s)]
*  you know that a terrorist might be in this apartment building. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3846.14s)]
*  How do you greenlight that you know because you kind of have to if you want to get [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3850.1800000000003s)]
*  rid of this terrorist. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3853.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean but we know the consequences of drone strikes. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3854.54s)]
*  There's some insane number of people that are innocent civilians that get killed. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3858.14s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3863.94s)]
*  It's been explained to me by my friends in the military that it's very difficult to [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3864.9s)]
*  know the truth because oftentimes in terms of what brother you get lies. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3868.14s)]
*  Oh I see either side. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3873.22s)]
*  Look for sure 100 percent for sure. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3874.62s)]
*  Into the interim in terms of the reasons for the orders that they can not just the [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3877.42s)]
*  reason for the orders but the amount of people that died that were innocent but for [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3880.58s)]
*  sure innocent people die. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3883.5s)]
*  The question is how many of them. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3884.98s)]
*  You know when they say someone they bombed a wedding party. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3886.54s)]
*  That's real. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3889.62s)]
*  That's happened. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3890.3399999999997s)]
*  Like thousands of people have died that way all over the world. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3891.18s)]
*  Whether it's in Yemen or wherever there's they're conducting bombing raids. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3895.18s)]
*  There have been many people that have not been a target that were killed. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3899.62s)]
*  But what are those numbers and what's the reality of it because if you're on that [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3905.8199999999997s)]
*  side that get bombed you might put out a press information. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3911.34s)]
*  You might put out something that says a thousand innocent civilians and they bombed [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3915.54s)]
*  a children's hospital. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3919.1400000000003s)]
*  But the reality might be it was actually 20 insurgents and 50 civilians. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3920.6600000000003s)]
*  Like we don't really know what the real numbers are unless you're on the ground [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3924.9s)]
*  doing a census. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3928.9s)]
*  I don't know if we get accurate information from either side. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3930.34s)]
*  But if you're a president you have to deal with that horrible reality that if you do [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3934.46s)]
*  an action if there's some sort of a military action that has to be taking place particularly [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3940.3799999999997s)]
*  like a drone bombing in a civilian area you're going to kill some innocent people. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3944.62s)]
*  That is a crazy thing to have on your conscience if you have a moral compass. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3949.4199999999996s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3955.4599999999996s)]
*  And what are the options to risk our service members and have them go in there and get [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3956.3399999999997s)]
*  gunned down and blown up and lose 50 percent of them because you didn't want to kill the [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3959.9399999999996s)]
*  same number of innocent civilians like and then you get into that conversation. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3965.1s)]
*  It's like what's the fucking what's the solution there. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3968.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3973.1400000000003s)]
*  Other than we shouldn't be at war with anybody and we should figure out a way to stop this [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3973.7000000000003s)]
*  before that happens before that happens all over the world. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3977.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3980.42s)]
*  Because usually you could kind of see it coming down the road. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3980.94s)]
*  You could see the scenario happening coming down the road. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3985.6600000000003s)]
*  So maybe the ability to strategically get in have the conversations you have to have [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3988.3s)]
*  before it actually gets to that before it escalates to the point of extreme violence. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3993.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3997.78s)]
*  But some people want extreme violence and that's the Eisenhower speech when he left [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=3998.1s)]
*  office that there's a military industrial complex that wants us to go to war. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4002.58s)]
*  They profit off war and they can you know if they're the people that are funding [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4006.14s)]
*  political campaigns and they have massive amounts of money that they're using as [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4011.3s)]
*  influence they can make certain politicians make decisions that are not in the best [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4014.86s)]
*  interests of the United States or the people that are the citizens. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4020.54s)]
*  They can do things entirely to make money. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4024.38s)]
*  You know like you see it and you see like the amount of money that's involved in [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4027.7s)]
*  something like Ukraine whether or not you're pro us helping Ukraine or not. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4033.78s)]
*  Where did we come up with all that money and why don't we have that money to fix [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4038.14s)]
*  America. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4041.42s)]
*  There was one point in time we talked about this where there was six billion [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4042.3s)]
*  dollars they accidentally paid to Ukraine. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4044.86s)]
*  They overpaid them six billion dollars. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4046.98s)]
*  That's the exact amount of money it would take to rebuild every single house in [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4049.78s)]
*  Maui. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4053.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4053.46s)]
*  Yeah and no discussion about that at all. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4054.14s)]
*  Instead the Maui people get seven hundred dollars a one time payment which is [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4056.54s)]
*  insane. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4060.62s)]
*  What are we. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4062.7000000000003s)]
*  Are we a community. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4063.62s)]
*  Are we not. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4065.02s)]
*  If we have the money to donate to some guy who is a fucking literally used to be a [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4065.86s)]
*  stand up comedian who used to play piano with his dick. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4071.34s)]
*  That's Zelensky. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4074.06s)]
*  He did a thing. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4075.26s)]
*  There's a video of him playing piano with his dick. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4076.9s)]
*  It was like one of his routines. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4079.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4081.34s)]
*  He was a comedian and he played a character on a television show that was a comedian. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4081.8199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4086.9399999999996s)]
*  Zelensky was a comedian and he played a character of a regular guy who becomes a [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4087.58s)]
*  president. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4091.66s)]
*  I forget what his job was in real life but he becomes a president and then ran for [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4092.58s)]
*  president in real life and became president. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4097.58s)]
*  And we're just sending this guy billions and billions and billions of dollars and [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4100.22s)]
*  some of it is just like where is it all going. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4105.62s)]
*  Like do we have an accurate account of like who is anybody siphoning this like. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4108.74s)]
*  Yeah we know that there's massive amounts of corruption all over the world when it [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4113.02s)]
*  comes to this kind of stuff like where's that money going. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4117.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4119.1s)]
*  This is not. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4119.54s)]
*  Why don't we have that money to fix inner cities. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4120.62s)]
*  Why don't we have that money for infrastructure whenever that money for the [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4122.46s)]
*  school system inner cities. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4125.62s)]
*  Homeless. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4128.5s)]
*  Yes schools. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4129.7s)]
*  What's going on in San Francisco. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4130.74s)]
*  San Francisco's Xi Jinping is going to visit and a bunch of Chinese a bunch of [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4132.5s)]
*  world leaders but Xi Jinping particularly. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4135.86s)]
*  And so they cleaned up all the homelessness. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4137.9s)]
*  They took all the tents out and they put fences up everywhere where the so the [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4140.3s)]
*  people can't can't camp out anymore. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4144.42s)]
*  We don't even know what they did with what I was just going to ask. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4146.9s)]
*  Well what did they do with it. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4148.7s)]
*  See if you can find a video of it. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4150.0599999999995s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4151.14s)]
*  And then you get Gavin Newsom on TV who's making excuses for it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4152.82s)]
*  He's like yeah we did. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4156.46s)]
*  Well when people come over to visit you know you clean your house up. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4157.54s)]
*  Like how about you fucking clean your house. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4161.1s)]
*  Take care of it first. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4163.38s)]
*  All the time. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4164.26s)]
*  If you can do this now you could do this always. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4165.1s)]
*  I'm assuming you did something ethically responsible with those people and house [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4168.900000000001s)]
*  them and put them up somewhere. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4172.860000000001s)]
*  I'm hoping that's what you did. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4174.3s)]
*  You just move their tent to the fucking middle of the desert or something. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4175.660000000001s)]
*  What have you done. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4178.820000000001s)]
*  After pictures. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4180.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah insane. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4181.540000000001s)]
*  Well this is just a couple of pictures but the really wild ones are the fences. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4182.900000000001s)]
*  They put fences up everywhere so the people can't camp there anymore troughs up [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4186.34s)]
*  right there. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4190.580000000001s)]
*  What are the troughs for. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4191.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4192.06s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4193.02s)]
*  What are the troughs for. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4193.38s)]
*  Troughs are weird. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4194.58s)]
*  But they hose down all the streets like hey guys why don't you fucking do this all [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4195.42s)]
*  the time. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4199.860000000001s)]
*  Like why isn't this always like this. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4200.42s)]
*  This is what San Francisco used to be like. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4203.14s)]
*  You ruined it. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4205.58s)]
*  Now we know that you could fix it and fix it quick. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4206.26s)]
*  Now we should be really upset. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4209.74s)]
*  As upset as people were before about the homeless problem in San Francisco they [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4211.74s)]
*  should be fucking furious about it now because they always had the ability to [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4215.58s)]
*  fix it quickly. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4219.3s)]

*  people. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4288.7s)]
*  Twelve hundred dollars per person who has verified over 8000 which is really [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4289.7s)]
*  amazing. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4293.62s)]
*  But one of the biggest things which first of all the whole fucking thing was so [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4295.62s)]
*  heartbreaking but then also don't forget about Maui. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4298.62s)]
*  And it's crazy because the work that now that me and the team have been putting it [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4303.14s)]
*  like it doesn't end. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4307.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4308.82s)]
*  It's a continuous calling these corporations. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4309.14s)]
*  Hey remember these are our American people. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4312.86s)]

*  They can't forget about them. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4318.54s)]
*  So it's just it's a wild thing. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4319.54s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4321.62s)]
*  That's not done by the government. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4322.0599999999995s)]
*  Like what are they. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4323.98s)]
*  Why wouldn't they do that. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4325.14s)]
*  It's the biggest wildfire the worst disaster in a hundred years in a hundred [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4326.58s)]
*  years. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4331.0199999999995s)]
*  We don't even know how many people are dead because so many people are [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4332.06s)]
*  unaccounted for and they can't find their but there's nothing left. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4335.14s)]
*  They're incinerated. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4337.9s)]
*  So how do you find who's missing and who's gone. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4339.18s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4341.9s)]
*  It's going to take a long time to sort it out. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4342.82s)]
*  Well and then the bill back to stand everybody back up on their feet and the [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4344.7s)]
*  families. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4348.54s)]
*  It's going to take a long long time. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4349.1s)]
*  A long time. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4351.66s)]
*  But if you think about it we stood this fund up on its feet brother within six [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4352.5s)]
*  weeks just like that. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4357.38s)]
*  They're still waiting for the governmental money. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4361.46s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4365.06s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4365.58s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4366.58s)]
*  When you think about how much money we donate to other countries and we flew in [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4367.22s)]
*  after that or after the wildfires man and it was it's like it's it's like [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4370.9s)]
*  something you've never seen before and you feel the weight and the heaviness of [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4376.14s)]
*  the area. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4380.22s)]

*  times I feel like when you land you you feel that aloha spirit feels good. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4387.3s)]
*  Yeah it's amazing. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4391.0199999999995s)]

*  And it's but you land there and you feel the heaviness fucking heavy heavy [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4393.62s)]
*  heartbreak. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4399.86s)]
*  Heartbreaking. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4400.66s)]
*  And it will be for a long time. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4401.379999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4402.7s)]
*  But I'm proud of them. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4403.379999999999s)]
*  I'm so proud of our people you know because it's like it's what you do in [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4404.219999999999s)]
*  times like this you fucking come together. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4407.099999999999s)]
*  Well the people that did survive and do come together they will never forget [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4409.219999999999s)]
*  and it'll be a part of them and then it'll probably bring those people closer [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4413.139999999999s)]
*  together especially the people that helped everybody. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4417.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4419.94s)]

*  No one would say what are you doing. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4432.94s)]
*  Why are you spending all that money on Maui for everyone for our own for our [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4434.339999999999s)]
*  own people. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4438.219999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4439.259999999999s)]
*  Which is crazy that Hawaii is America anyway. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4439.74s)]
*  I mean it's great that it's protected by America but isn't it crazy you have to [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4443.139999999999s)]
*  fly five hours over the ocean. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4447.14s)]
*  You're still in America. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4449.700000000001s)]
*  You literally land in a beautiful volcano in the middle of the ocean that's [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4451.740000000001s)]
*  created islands. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4456.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4457.660000000001s)]

*  It's fucking wild. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4460.34s)]

*  Protect it to the core. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4469.14s)]

*  It's so insulting and so insane in the light of all this public knowledge of the [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4475.18s)]
*  amount of money that we're sending to other countries. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4479.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4481.3s)]

*  It's great for months. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4486.900000000001s)]
*  And anyone who's verified and you know with Polynesian culture there's it's [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4487.900000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of people in the house at times like aunties and uncles and [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4494.34s)]
*  grandparents. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4497.22s)]
*  So there's some houses that are getting four or five six thousand dollars. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4497.700000000001s)]
*  That's great. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4501.62s)]

*  And again it should be coming from the government and it could be done. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4504.38s)]
*  It's not something that couldn't be done. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4507.820000000001s)]
*  I mean it's something that everybody would support. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4509.22s)]

*  I mean what are we. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4513.38s)]
*  If we're not a country. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4514.9800000000005s)]
*  If we're not. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4516.54s)]
*  It's the same thing with family. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4516.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4517.9400000000005s)]
*  Like you would take care of your family. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4518.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4519.54s)]
*  I take care of my family first. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4519.860000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4521.02s)]
*  Take care of our American people. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4521.34s)]
*  It's a community. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4522.9800000000005s)]
*  We should be a community. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4524.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4525.860000000001s)]
*  And we're so divided and polarized right now. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4526.1s)]
*  And I think a lot of that is accentuated by social media and also accentuated by [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4528.58s)]
*  the mental illness of being obsessed by social media because I think it is a [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4533.34s)]
*  mental illness. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4536.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it's a mental illness just like gambling addiction is a mental illness. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4538.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4541.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it's just that people are goddamn addicted to apps and their phone and [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4542.14s)]
*  and just reading stuff and attacking each other. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4547.38s)]
*  And yes it's caused this divide to be reading stuff and believing. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4550.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4557.1s)]
*  Well it was when I was a kid. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4557.38s)]
*  You can have a Republican friend. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4560.02s)]
*  Like it was no big deal. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4562.22s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4563.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4563.7s)]
*  No big deal. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4564.06s)]
*  Like oh Bobby likes George Bush. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4564.82s)]
*  Of course. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4566.42s)]
*  Who gives a fuck. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4567.1s)]
*  You know you were a supporter of Bill Clinton. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4568.26s)]
*  He liked George Bush. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4570.06s)]
*  Nobody cared. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4571.3s)]
*  Nobody like fuck you. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4572.06s)]

*  I just want lower taxes. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4576.74s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4579.02s)]
*  How did I become a Nazi. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4580.34s)]
*  It's the craziest thing. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4582.1s)]
*  I have friends who support Trump. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4583.26s)]
*  I have friends who support Biden. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4586.18s)]
*  I have friends. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4587.74s)]
*  Do you really have friends who support Biden. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4588.14s)]
*  Come on. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4590.22s)]
*  No no no no no. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4590.5s)]
*  Here's what I do. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4591.54s)]
*  I have I have friends. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4592.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4594.46s)]
*  That's a good check because that's important. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4594.86s)]
*  This is important context. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4597.02s)]
*  They support the Democratic Party. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4598.06s)]
*  I have friends who are loyal to the party. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4599.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4600.9s)]
*  And they're the progressive. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4601.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4602.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4603.22s)]
*  Loyal to the party. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4603.66s)]
*  Support Trump by friends who are like fuck it I'm not voting for either one. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4604.78s)]
*  Last election this election so it but it's that kind of thing that I would love to see us get to that place where it's OK. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4607.9s)]
*  Yeah it should be. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4618.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4619.34s)]
*  You should be a person. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4619.820000000001s)]
*  No problem. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4620.62s)]
*  People should be able to have discussions about the differing opinions and not turn it into some crazy insult fest which is what you see online and you see it all the time you see it online even with political commentators they get in these interview sessions they fucking start yelling and screaming at each other. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4621.1s)]
*  It's like. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4637.9800000000005s)]
*  It's fucking. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4640.1s)]
*  It's fucking stupid. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4640.860000000001s)]
*  It's bad for you too. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4642.06s)]
*  It's bad for the people that are engaging in it. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4643.06s)]
*  It's bad for everybody who's listening. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4644.54s)]
*  Well so yeah and it's it's unhealthy. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4645.820000000001s)]
*  Not only unhealthy for yourself but also just in terms of humanity man. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4647.98s)]
*  Yeah it's bad for humanity. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4653.3s)]
*  Yeah absolutely. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4654.74s)]
*  Let me ask you this you you were you talked about it's even for our guys our military boys and girls who are on the ground to get information that they feels really accurate. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4656.38s)]
*  Like what have your guys said. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4666.139999999999s)]
*  Like for example Marcus a trail who's our friend and Tim Kennedy and I have two Navy SEALs in my family two cousins like what are what are your guys saying. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4668.38s)]
*  How how do they combat the idea of not getting the correct information. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4677.82s)]
*  Well they do their very best and especially like special operators SEALs Rangers I mean they get pretty solid information for what their objective is. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4684.54s)]
*  But obviously their objective is very narrow. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4693.54s)]
*  They deal with very whatever the situation is they have to go and take care of it. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4695.42s)]
*  They need to know how many enemy combatants they need to be know know who's in the house what's there what how to get in. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4699.46s)]
*  You know it's a very specific skill set that these gentlemen have and they have to rely on accurate information and for the most part they're the very best at getting their information to those special operators. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4705.42s)]
*  But when it deals like with a worldwide scale like trying to figure out what's real and what's not and who's telling the truth and who's not. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4717.9s)]
*  Fuck good luck because there's so much Russian disinformation and Chinese disinformation and American disinformation. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4726.82s)]
*  I mean there's just entire groups of people dedicate to dedicated to these troll farms that just go online and make things up and attack people and try to organize these campaigns against a certain idea or a certain political candidate. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4733.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's just organized and it's you know it's funded and though it's hard if you're a person and you have a family and a job and interest and you check the news. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4749.26s)]
*  Every you know once a day twice a day try it just try figuring out what the fuck is actually is true. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4762.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4768.38s)]
*  So I always tell people especially younger people like hey be careful you could read it but be careful about really what you believe. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4769.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4775.06s)]
*  And what's funny is I'm sure you notice this too and for a lot of people listening is when you see the trolls and these campaigns that are funded. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4775.5s)]
*  And they look like they're legit and they got all their shit together is what I always find interesting is the loudest shit talkers on there who are saying really like enough where it really stops you in your tracks like wow you really took time to type that they have zero post on their account. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4786.22s)]
*  Yeah very few posts very few followers. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4803.86s)]
*  And the only thing they want to do is that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4806.66s)]
*  And that's probably a funded person. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4808.9s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4811.22s)]
*  The lot of them. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4812.46s)]
*  But of course there are. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4813.860000000001s)]
*  It's an effective technique to get people. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4815.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4816.9400000000005s)]
*  Kilcliffe. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4818.06s)]
*  This is my own flavor. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4818.62s)]
*  So spicy pineapple. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4819.7s)]
*  That's my nickname in college. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4822.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah there's some good. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4830.02s)]
*  There's a report they did on Facebook. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4831.820000000001s)]
*  The top 20 Christian sites 19 of them were run by Russian troll firms 19 of them. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4834.38s)]
*  We're like stirring people up and the resurrection is coming and you know. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4841.9800000000005s)]
*  How do we navigate and combat that. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4846.14s)]
*  Mind reading. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4850.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah we have to get to a point where technology allows us to legitimately read people's thoughts and I think that's coming quicker than we realize. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4852.46s)]
*  I think that's around the corner. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4860.14s)]
*  I think that's 10 years from now. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4861.14s)]
*  If we don't blow ourselves up within 10 years we're going to be able to read intentions. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4863.02s)]
*  We're going to be able to know thoughts. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4866.5s)]
*  We're going to be able to know things. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4868.34s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4869.74s)]
*  How do you think like what technology. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4870.58s)]
*  Yeah probably some sort of a wearable device initially and then for probably higher bandwidth applications and especially for people that have neurological conditions and spinal cord injuries they're going to start implanting like Neuralink. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4872.94s)]
*  And one of Neuralink's first goals is to try to bring people that have spinal cord breaks and people that have lost control of their muscles and to bring them back to mobility. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4886.219999999999s)]
*  And they think that that's possible which is amazing. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4900.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4902.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4903.34s)]
*  What they're going to be able to do is bypass. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4903.74s)]
*  I'm crudely phrasing this if you're a scientist I'm sorry but they're going to be able to bypass the human neurological system in terms of like how you move your arms and body and muscles and do it electronically. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4907.78s)]
*  And they think they can do that and they think that's going to be one of the first medical applications for this kind of a thing. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4918.78s)]
*  But the other thing that Elon said to me said you're going to be able to talk without words. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4924.86s)]
*  Now when most people say you're going to be able to talk without words I'm like yeah man that'd be wild. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4929.9s)]
*  But when Elon says it you're like for real. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4934.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4936.94s)]
*  Well you think you really think we're going to be able to talk without words is like 100 percent. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4937.3s)]
*  What's the B side to that. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4940.179999999999s)]
*  Like what is that exactly. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4941.78s)]
*  It's going to be something. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4943.82s)]
*  This technology will be some sort of an implanted device that allows you to have constant access probably to something akin to chat GPT and AI or the next level of it. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4945.54s)]
*  Along with some interconnectivity with other people that are wearing the same device. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4959.5s)]
*  And it'll probably initially be something that translates languages instantaneously. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4965.82s)]
*  And then as it advances it will be able to read thoughts and you'll be able to transfer images things you see. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4971.66s)]
*  I will be able to have this thing in my mind and show my friend Greg that I'm sitting here with the rock having a conversation and he could see that through my eyes. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4979.82s)]
*  We will have universal connectivity with all minds all minds that have that thing. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4990.9400000000005s)]
*  The real problem is the haves and have nots because just like if you go back and watch Wall Street like Michael Douglas had that fucking big ass brick telephone he was walking on the beach like look at this guy. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=4996.42s)]
*  He's got a phone. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5008.9s)]
*  He's walking on the beach. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5009.58s)]
*  What a baller. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5010.5s)]
*  Now anyone that you know you can go to fucking T-Mobile and get a flip phone for like 50 bucks. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5011.74s)]
*  You get a cheap cell phone. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5018.139999999999s)]
*  We could talk to a person. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5019.7s)]
*  It's a tiny thing. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5021.259999999999s)]
*  It sits in your pocket. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5021.98s)]
*  It's so much better than what Michael Douglas had. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5023.179999999999s)]
*  And everybody can get it. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5025.74s)]
*  But back then it was super expensive. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5027.38s)]
*  Nobody had it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5029.66s)]
*  And the haves like Michael Douglas in that movie greed is good. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5031.139999999999s)]
*  They they use that thing to advance their career. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5035.0599999999995s)]
*  Multiply that times a million and you have the advantage of the initial adopters of whatever this thing is because if they integrate with artificial intelligence initially and they integrate with some sort of a universal Internet system they're going to be able to accomplish [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5038.9s)]
*  in business and in terms of like manipulation of financial markets and in terms of acquiring resources they're going to be able to do things that the people without those things are not going to be able to do and they will have massive amounts of wealth and power almost instantly. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5058.7s)]
*  Within years it'll be a change a giant shift. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5073.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5078.02s)]
*  That'll go over to the people that have these devices. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5078.46s)]
*  And that's fucking that's the most insane have and have nots because you essentially have super humans essentially have something that's almost like an alien that exists with these advanced primates which is what we are. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5081.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5095.54s)]
*  Does Elon feel like that will happen within a decade. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5096.42s)]
*  He thinks it's going to happen pretty quick. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5100.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah it probably will be within a decade. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5101.98s)]
*  Yeah he thinks that once they start implementing it and they've already started trials with human beings. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5104.46s)]
*  I think the first trials they're doing are with people with neurological either conditions or injuries. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5109.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5114.5s)]
*  And you know I've also heard it talked about vision. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5114.86s)]
*  They're going to be able to restore people's vision. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5117.46s)]
*  They're going to be able to do some why old shit. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5121.22s)]
*  By the way brother I mean 10 years is right around the corner. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5124.14s)]
*  So quick. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5126.46s)]
*  Ten years ago it was 2013. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5127.7s)]
*  It's nothing that seems like like like if you have a 2013 car that's a fucking pretty new car. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5129.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5135.18s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5135.7s)]
*  How is that 10 years ago. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5136.9800000000005s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5138.62s)]
*  I always tell people this when I was in high school in 1981 a 1970 car was a classic. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5139.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5146.58s)]
*  It was only 11 years old. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5147.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5148.02s)]
*  But if you had like a 1970 Barracuda like wow look at that fucking thing. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5148.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5154.18s)]
*  It was a classic already but time seemed to move different then like 10 years back then seemed like a long fucking time. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5154.66s)]
*  And as society and technology and innovation just spins is this insane ever rapid pace. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5163.86s)]
*  Ten years feels like nothing. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5171.14s)]
*  Dude it's the acceleration that we live in today. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5172.5s)]
*  Yeah absolutely. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5174.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah there's so much going on. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5176.66s)]
*  And I think when that does happen there's two battles. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5178.38s)]
*  What was your first car. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5181.38s)]
*  My first car was a 1973 Chevelle. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5182.9400000000005s)]
*  How old were you. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5185.9800000000005s)]
*  I was 16. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5186.66s)]
*  Yeah I was 16. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5189.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5189.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah it was a hunk of shit. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5190.34s)]
*  I think I bought it for 350 bucks. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5191.46s)]
*  I'm actually I'm positive I bought it for 350 bucks. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5192.98s)]
*  It was worth 300 bucks. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5195.54s)]
*  It died the next day. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5197.78s)]
*  It died the next day. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5200.0599999999995s)]
*  But the dude took it back. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5201.139999999999s)]
*  There was something wrong with the engine. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5202.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like dude the fucking engine seized up. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5203.219999999999s)]
*  Was that like your boy from your hometown. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5204.94s)]
*  Like you know. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5206.7s)]
*  That was a guy I knew a guy I knew but he took it back. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5206.9s)]
*  And. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5209.339999999999s)]
*  It died the next day. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5209.7s)]
*  Yeah it died the next day. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5210.5s)]
*  And then I got a I was always into muscle cars. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5211.7s)]
*  I had a bunch of muscle cars. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5213.82s)]
*  That was always what I was into. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5215.419999999999s)]
*  You know. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5216.9s)]
*  Well how old were you when you got your first one. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5217.179999999999s)]
*  16. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5218.54s)]
*  OK so I'm 15. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5219.299999999999s)]
*  I'm in a bar in Nashville. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5220.62s)]
*  And I had no business being in a bar. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5222.860000000001s)]
*  It was downtown Nashville. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5225.14s)]
*  And on lower broad. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5227.46s)]
*  Because at that time I had this fantasy in my head that I was [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5229.820000000001s)]
*  going to be a country music singer. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5232.820000000001s)]
*  Really. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5234.46s)]
*  Dude. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5235.14s)]
*  Well you know I love country. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5235.58s)]
*  I think it's about that. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5236.74s)]
*  I know you wanted to be a country music singer. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5238.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5239.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5240.58s)]
*  Until I was like oh I sing in fucking keys that don't exist. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5241.34s)]
*  It's gonna be a short lived. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5246.9400000000005s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5249.3s)]
*  But dude so I would go down to these honky tonks. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5250.0199999999995s)]
*  So I was down there with a buddy of mine in downtown Bruno [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5251.82s)]
*  and who's still one of my best friends today and a drunk walks [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5254.5s)]
*  in and says hey who wants to buy a car. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5257.379999999999s)]
*  I had no car at that time no money. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5259.7s)]
*  We just got evicted out of Hawaii. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5261.299999999999s)]
*  And I said I'll buy it. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5263.339999999999s)]
*  And I had no money. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5265.259999999999s)]
*  I said how much he goes seventy five eighty bucks. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5265.98s)]
*  I said cool. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5267.78s)]
*  I tell Bruno how much money you got. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5268.66s)]
*  He goes I only got 40. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5269.94s)]
*  I said give me 40. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5270.9s)]
*  So I give it to the drunk who's probably high too as well. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5271.78s)]
*  And I said here I'll come back and give you the other 40. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5274.54s)]

*  So you see right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5558.58s)]
*  That's like right when the arrow releases it hits it it's sparking up. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5559.38s)]
*  Yeah it was I mean fucking just. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5565.94s)]
*  Ate it like it was nothing. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5568.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5569.94s)]
*  It's just cool. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5570.62s)]
*  I mean he just decided to make it like it's you know just make the fucking coolest. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5571.9s)]
*  Cyber vehicle that he can. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5576.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5578.179999999999s)]
*  He just likes. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5578.42s)]
*  Look he's the best kind of billionaire to me because he does wild shit. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5579.54s)]
*  I mean he made the fucking tip of the SpaceX rocket pointy because he wanted to look more like the one on space balls. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5584.3s)]
*  Literally. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5594.42s)]
*  I mean that's literally what he did. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5596.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5597.58s)]
*  He's just a wild fella. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5597.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5599.86s)]
*  You know and he just. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5600.179999999999s)]
*  So idea. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5601.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5602.62s)]
*  Make it happen. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5602.9s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5603.78s)]
*  I mean he detailed the process of going from an initial concept making you know a demonstration vehicle and then production. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5604.5s)]
*  How difficult it is and how many things have to line up. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5612.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5615.5s)]
*  Especially when you get something that's incredibly innovative and complicated. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5616.139999999999s)]
*  I was going to say so the innovation the complication the production cost on that and how heavy it is. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5619.179999999999s)]
*  What do you think that's going for. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5623.86s)]
*  I think there's going to be three different tiers he said. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5625.58s)]
*  There's going to be a beast mode which is like the most insane you know eleven hundred horsepower three electric engines zero to sixteen under three seconds which is insane for a seven thousand plus pound vehicle. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5628.0199999999995s)]
*  Three seconds. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5640.3s)]
*  Three seconds. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5640.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5641.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5641.78s)]
*  OK. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5642.14s)]
*  And then there's going to be a lower tier model but even like if you get a model three which is like their entry level Tesla it's fast as fuck. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5642.82s)]
*  It's so fast. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5650.54s)]
*  It's so competent and it's so it's a joy to drive. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5652.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5655.5s)]
*  And if you've never driven an electric car you've got to get past the fact that it doesn't make any noise because a lot of people love the rumble of the V8 and all that jazz. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5656.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5662.74s)]
*  But if you can get past that this the sheer ability that they have just go just take off. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5663.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5669.74s)]
*  Mine goes zero to 16 one point nine seconds. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5670.179999999999s)]
*  Do you miss the rumbling of the muscle cars. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5673.34s)]
*  Not just drive a muscle car when I missed the run. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5675.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5677.3s)]
*  Those those feel different though to me when I drive those those are that's like I'm on a ride. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5678.58s)]
*  That's like I'm on a Disneyland ride for adults. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5684.339999999999s)]
*  It's like whoo. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5686.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5687.98s)]
*  You have to go fast just a rumble and a shift in the gears. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5688.099999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5691.139999999999s)]
*  It's glorious. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5691.94s)]
*  It's I love them. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5693.42s)]
*  Those things are there in my DNA. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5694.78s)]
*  You know because when I was a boy those were the coolest cars. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5698.139999999999s)]
*  Those were the cars that everybody all my friends we all wanted. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5701.58s)]
*  We all wanted muscle cars. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5704.58s)]
*  Everybody wanted a 1970 Challenger. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5705.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5707.98s)]
*  Sixty nine Camaro. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5708.42s)]
*  That's what everybody wanted. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5710.0199999999995s)]
*  So those are the cars that I really love. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5711.299999999999s)]
*  What's your what's your baby. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5712.58s)]
*  That's a muscle car. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5713.62s)]
*  I got a bunch of them. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5714.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5715.7s)]
*  I like them all. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5715.94s)]
*  You know I have a 1970 Barracuda that's fucking insane color roadster shop Bill Silver and it's got a 900 horsepower Mercury engine in it. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5716.98s)]
*  Yeah it's a racing engine that goes to like 9000 RPMs. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5728.34s)]
*  That's my car. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5732.66s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5733.18s)]
*  Have you opened it up. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5733.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5734.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5735.26s)]
*  Yeah that thing's a beast. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5735.7s)]
*  That thing is really fun. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5737.26s)]
*  That's really fun. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5738.94s)]
*  But that was the car my mom had. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5740.38s)]
*  My mom had a 71 when I was a kid. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5742.34s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5744.38s)]
*  So there's a there's an emotional. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5744.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5746.62s)]
*  To me that was always the car. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5747.860000000001s)]
*  Barracuda is just they only made him cool for like three years. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5749.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5752.7s)]
*  But in those three years that body shape is just so bad. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5753.14s)]
*  This is what John Wick had in John Wick 4. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5756.38s)]
*  Yeah dude. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5758.18s)]
*  You know that 71 Barracuda. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5758.78s)]
*  You know it's crazy when you when you tell me that because it informs a lot in my head like oh hey my mom had that car. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5760.900000000001s)]
*  So if just emotionally there's a real emotional connection there. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5766.42s)]
*  So growing up I never had muscle cars in my life and even my dad. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5769.419999999999s)]
*  So it's crazy as wrestlers and I know you've had some few wrestlers on especially my dad's era in the 80s those guys. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5774.66s)]
*  It was always important that the wrestlers either had a Cadillac or Lincoln. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5780.7s)]
*  So they're always flossing. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5787.139999999999s)]
*  Always looking amazing pulling up to like the arena and a caddy or like that was a prerequisite. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5788.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5793.299999999999s)]
*  And then we drive home to our fucking trailer park. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5794.0599999999995s)]
*  But it was crazy. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5796.58s)]
*  So growing up for me it was less muscle cars even though I appreciated them in movies. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5797.22s)]
*  It was more dude I can't wait to get a caddy. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5801.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah caddies are great. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5804.18s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5805.14s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5805.780000000001s)]
*  It's like just you're floating. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5806.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5808.26s)]
*  Just floating down the road. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5808.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5810.06s)]
*  Those were the shit. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5810.58s)]
*  But there's also that thing too about like just the emotional connection. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5811.780000000001s)]
*  And then I realized when I got my first caddy I was like well I'm on a second. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5815.9800000000005s)]
*  I was like well I'm on a second. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5820.18s)]
*  I like it. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5821.9400000000005s)]
*  That's it actually represents like what we call in the wrestling business work in the gimmick. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5822.660000000001s)]
*  Meaning the guys work in the gimmick and I thought I don't want the caddy if it makes me feel like I'm working the [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5827.34s)]
*  gimmick. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5832.780000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5833.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5833.660000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5834.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5834.38s)]
*  You're flossing like almost stereotypically for us flossing. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5834.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5838.46s)]
*  Does correct. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5839.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5840.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5840.58s)]
*  That's why I went to pick up trucks. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5841.26s)]
*  Christian Bale drives around in a night. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5842.46s)]
*  It was a no it's a 2003 Toyota Tacoma. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5844.860000000001s)]
*  And so that's like a hundred fifty million before he became. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5851.02s)]
*  No no no right now. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5856.54s)]
*  That's what he drives around in 2003 Toyota Tacoma. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5858.14s)]
*  Wait so he drives. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5862.42s)]
*  What's the emotional thing by. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5863.38s)]
*  Do you think there's a connection there with Chris says it's good. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5864.740000000001s)]
*  It's a good car. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5867.42s)]
*  Never breaks. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5868.18s)]
*  He's like if someone needs me to carry something I can put it in the back. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5869.58s)]
*  He's just fucking. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5873.14s)]
*  He's an artist. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5874.58s)]
*  He's just pragmatic. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5875.38s)]
*  Doesn't give a shit. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5876.42s)]
*  It doesn't give a shit. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5877.26s)]
*  He's not interested in material. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=5877.9800000000005s)]

*  Guys in the locker room, everybody take me under their wing. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=6925.1s)]
*  There's some political bullshit that you always want to stay away from. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=6928.3s)]
*  I've always stayed away from that. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=6930.5s)]
*  But for the most part, everybody's supportive, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=6931.700000000001s)]
*  because even though it's a cutthroat business backstage, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=6933.900000000001s)]

*  That guy drives a pickup truck, drinks a beer, tells everybody go fuck themselves. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=6974.78s)]

*  And I said, no, OK. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7004.86s)]
*  And it started not to feel good to me because I said, well, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7006.0599999999995s)]

*  Pressure. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7083.299999999999s)]
*  You're in there. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7084.5s)]
*  And the guy who I was wrestling, the Sultan, who was actually my cousin, [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7085.7s)]
*  Rikishi, from my Samoan side, he had me in a rear chinlock. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7089.9s)]
*  Whole arenas chanting Rocky Sox. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7095.179999999999s)]
*  He's whispering to me, don't listen to him. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7097.379999999999s)]
*  Don't listen to him. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7099.58s)]
*  Now I'm like, this is my life now. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7101.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7103.98s)]
*  We get out of the match. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7106.179999999999s)]
*  I go backstage. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7108.379999999999s)]
*  Vince looks at me and Pat and just says, I don't know what we did wrong, but we [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7109.58s)]
*  have to make a change. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7114.78s)]
*  I know what that means. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7115.98s)]
*  Two days later, I dropped the belt to somebody else. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7118.179999999999s)]
*  Now I'm getting beaten. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7122.379999999999s)]
*  I'm getting beat every night, getting beat every night. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7124.38s)]
*  And then I get hurt. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7127.58s)]
*  I tear my PCL or wrestling guy named Mick Foley. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7129.38s)]
*  Now, by this time it's May. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7132.58s)]
*  Vince says, take time off. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7134.78s)]
*  Heal your knee. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7136.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know what we did wrong or where we went wrong, but we got to really figure [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7138.18s)]
*  things out with you. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7143.38s)]
*  I don't know if this is going to work out. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7144.58s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7146.78s)]
*  And this is 1997, summer of 97. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7147.9800000000005s)]
*  Now, this you'll appreciate this part. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7151.78s)]
*  In 97, during that time, I was still going out to L.A. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7154.98s)]
*  and working out. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7160.179999999999s)]
*  We were crossing all the MMA guys. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7161.379999999999s)]
*  Pride just opened up in Japan. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7165.58s)]
*  So I was seeing all these MMA guys going over to Pride. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7168.78s)]
*  You remember that time, right? [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7171.98s)]
*  I think you might have been with UFC at that time, right? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7174.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7176.379999999999s)]
*  And at that time, I was making $150,000 wrestling 235 days a year. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7177.9800000000005s)]
*  So do the math of that and how much you're making per match. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7184.18s)]
*  We start hearing, hey, these guys over in Pride are making 250, 350, 500. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7188.38s)]
*  And I thought then, well, fuck, I don't think I'm going to make it in WWE. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7193.58s)]
*  People are booing me out of the arenas. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7198.78s)]
*  I can't be myself. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7200.9800000000005s)]
*  They're telling me to fucking smile. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7202.18s)]
*  I don't want to fucking smile. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7203.38s)]
*  It's not who I am. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7204.58s)]
*  I start talking to Ken Shamrock at that time who's wrestling with us. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7206.38s)]
*  I run into Mark Kerr. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7209.38s)]
*  I start talking to him. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7211.38s)]
*  He told me a little bit about Pride and I have this idea in my head. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7212.58s)]
*  Well, maybe I should maybe I should train to MMA [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7215.78s)]
*  and go to Pride and make money, real money. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7219.38s)]
*  And then I don't have to smile. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7222.38s)]
*  I'm sure I'm going to get fucked up over there [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7224.58s)]
*  and then knock one of my lungs loose. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7227.38s)]
*  But maybe I could do something like that, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7228.78s)]
*  find the right coach and train. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7231.98s)]
*  So I had this whole thing in my head. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7233.38s)]
*  I was talking to my wife at that time. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7235.18s)]
*  I said, I think that's the way to go [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7236.9800000000005s)]
*  because those guys are paying real money. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7239.38s)]
*  And these fans are booing me over here for 150 grand. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7240.780000000001s)]
*  I get a call from Vince and he says, how's your knee? [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7245.780000000001s)]
*  I said, it's healing up. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7248.38s)]
*  I don't tell him about this idea. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7249.58s)]
*  After I've talked to Shamrock and Kerr and all these guys, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7250.9800000000005s)]
*  he goes, I want to try and bring you back one time. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7256.58s)]
*  See how it works out. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7259.58s)]
*  I want to turn you heel. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7260.58s)]
*  And we have a faction called the Nation of Domination, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7262.38s)]
*  who DC loves, by the way, that was his famous, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7266.18s)]
*  his favorite, Daniel, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7268.38s)]
*  the Black Militant Group. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7271.9800000000005s)]
*  He goes, I want to have you join them [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7273.58s)]
*  and we'll see how it works out. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7275.38s)]
*  I come in. I said, OK. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7277.38s)]
*  But I still got this MMA thought in my head. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7279.58s)]
*  Again, I just want to make money and I want to be myself. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7282.18s)]
*  When I get to the arena that night, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7285.38s)]
*  I'm going to join the nation. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7287.18s)]
*  I went to Vince. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7288.18s)]
*  And at that time, there was only just two hours of live show, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7289.179999999999s)]
*  Monday Night Raw. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7292.379999999999s)]
*  Now there's six hours of show on two different programs. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7293.379999999999s)]
*  So I said to Vince, hey, tonight when I go out there, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7296.98s)]
*  could I just have two minutes on the microphone? [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7299.58s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7301.98s)]
*  He goes, it's live. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7303.58s)]
*  You know, all our times accounted for, allocated. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7304.78s)]
*  I said, I just need two minutes. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7307.58s)]
*  He goes, why? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7308.78s)]
*  I said, I just want to be real and just tell the fans how I feel. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7309.78s)]
*  And I feel like I need to recalibrate things here. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7314.58s)]
*  He said, fine. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7317.78s)]
*  A minute. You got. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7319.18s)]
*  Great. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7320.58s)]
*  Get on the microphone. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7321.98s)]
*  Now I'm walking out. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7322.98s)]
*  They're booing me. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7324.38s)]
*  Rocky sucks. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7325.38s)]
*  But now I'm a heel with this heel group. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7326.38s)]
*  I grab the microphone and I say something like, listen, [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7329.58s)]
*  I'm a lot of things, but sucks isn't one of them. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7331.78s)]
*  And joining the nation isn't a white thing. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7334.38s)]
*  It's not a black thing. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7336.18s)]
*  It's a me kicking your ass thing. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7336.98s)]
*  And I'm going to earn this respect one way or the other. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7338.78s)]
*  Dude, that was the most freeing thing for me in my career. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7342.18s)]
*  It was like, you know how you have these defining moments? [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7345.98s)]
*  Even in that one little moment, I was just fucking ripping all this open. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7348.379999999999s)]
*  So here I am. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7352.58s)]
*  Now you can fucking boo me. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7353.78s)]
*  But now watch how I respond. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7355.379999999999s)]
*  I'm going to be real. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7357.379999999999s)]
*  Not enough to smile anymore. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7358.379999999999s)]
*  I don't know. Fuck the smiling. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7359.379999999999s)]
*  I'll smile when I want to smile. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7360.58s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7361.78s)]
*  But now watch how I can respond. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7362.58s)]
*  Watch my words now. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7365.179999999999s)]
*  Watch my actions. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7366.379999999999s)]
*  Dude, the fans felt something that night [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7369.379999999999s)]
*  within a month, I became the hottest heel in WWE. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7372.78s)]
*  Wow. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7378.38s)]
*  I think this is it. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7379.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7380.58s)]
*  That's the gratitude I get from you pieces of crap for all my blood, my sweat and my tears. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7382.38s)]
*  Look at that baby face. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7389.18s)]
*  Look at that, dude. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7389.98s)]
*  This isn't about the color of my skin. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7391.18s)]
*  This is about respect. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7393.98s)]
*  I became the youngest intercontinental champion in WWF history. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7396.18s)]
*  And what did it get me? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7405.58s)]
*  In arenas across the country, I heard chants of Rocky sucks. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7406.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, Rocky might be is a lot of things, but sucks isn't one of them. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7418.780000000001s)]
*  You know, hey, that's not a black thing. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7423.58s)]
*  It's not a white thing. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7426.18s)]
*  And hey, let's talk about a racist faction. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7427.38s)]
*  You want to talk about a group that's prejudice. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7430.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's talk about the DOA. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7433.38s)]
*  The DOA epitomizes racism. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7436.780000000001s)]
*  But hey, you know what the hell with the DOA? [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7439.38s)]
*  I want to make one point to all you jackass fans out there. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7442.58s)]
*  Rocky Maivia and the new nation of domination lives, breathes and dies respect. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7448.18s)]
*  And we will earn respect by any means necessary. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7456.18s)]
*  That was it. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7462.18s)]
*  That started off the heel journey. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7463.38s)]
*  It started it off, man. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7465.38s)]
*  And then that was it. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7466.58s)]
*  But you know what it is. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7467.9800000000005s)]
*  I look back on that and I feel like it's just a life lesson for all of us, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7469.18s)]
*  which is the most powerful thing you could be is yourself. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7473.9800000000005s)]
*  And even in that crazy world of fucking fictionalized pro wrestling that some [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7477.780000000001s)]
*  people love, some people don't, that idea of. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7482.98s)]
*  Yeah, ripping it out, being who you are. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7488.379999999999s)]
*  Here I am, man. Yeah. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7490.379999999999s)]
*  Vince is just so interesting. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7491.98s)]
*  He's such an interesting guy. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7493.98s)]
*  The fact that he's driven for so long, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7495.379999999999s)]
*  for so long, this guy's been just fucking getting after it for so long and just [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7498.58s)]
*  lives and breathes this idea of crafting narratives and figure out who's the good [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7504.98s)]
*  guy and who's the bad guy and how to set up a storyline and paying attention to [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7509.98s)]
*  what's happening politically, what's happening, tapping into that. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7514.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Always have his finger on the pulse of what's happening. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7517.98s)]
*  I can see how he tried the thing about you smiling all the time. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7522.179999999999s)]
*  You got a great smile, friendly, good looking guy. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7524.98s)]
*  Why not have a smile? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7527.58s)]
*  It's smile. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7528.98s)]
*  People like it. And you know what he said? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7529.78s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to give you a push, but I want to make sure people, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7530.98s)]
*  if you smile, then people will know you're grateful. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7534.58s)]
*  And I was like, OK, I get the conceit of that. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7537.58s)]
*  Right. But there's other ways I think I can be grateful because otherwise I'm [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7541.78s)]
*  coming across as being a phony and that's just not who I am. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7546.18s)]
*  So by the way, years later or even months later, I mean, he admitted he said, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7549.58s)]
*  I totally get it now. I understand. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7553.58s)]
*  Did Japanese pro wrestling come out of American pro wrestling or was it a [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7555.78s)]
*  separate thing that evolved on its own? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7560.38s)]
*  I think it was a separate thing that evolved on its own. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7562.18s)]
*  Well, I think everything evolved out of American wrestling that started off [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7564.38s)]
*  originally started off in the carnivals, started off in in catch wrestling [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7568.9800000000005s)]
*  and things like that, which eventually evolved to one of MMA techniques. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7574.78s)]
*  The carnivals for people who don't know, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7579.18s)]
*  literally they'd have traveling carnivals where someone would take on anyone in the [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7580.78s)]
*  crowd. That's right. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7585.58s)]
*  And these were real wrestlers, real catch wrestlers who knew submissions and they [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7586.58s)]
*  would pin guys and get them in ankle cranks. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7590.98s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7594.179999999999s)]
*  And so the whole the thing that started going sideways, which required a Vince [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7595.379999999999s)]
*  McMahon type, wait a second, we're not doing this right because these guys who [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7602.179999999999s)]
*  were just these fucking badasses, you know, they go to the carnival, you know, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7606.78s)]
*  ten bucks, five bucks. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7610.78s)]
*  You come in, try your luck if you can beat the champion. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7611.78s)]
*  The champion beat the shit out of all of these guys. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7614.179999999999s)]
*  But every once in a while, you got a guy who came in out of the blue off the [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7616.78s)]
*  street who knew how to protect himself and hold his own, might have known a [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7620.98s)]
*  hold or two and wind up beating the champion. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7624.58s)]
*  And this started to happen. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7627.379999999999s)]
*  And before you know it, a promoter or promoters or some whether it's the [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7629.179999999999s)]
*  fighters, whoever it was, the wrestlers possibly. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7632.86s)]
*  But someone was like, hold on a second. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7635.58s)]
*  We need to work this because otherwise we're running a risk. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7638.299999999999s)]
*  That's getting fucked up. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7641.58s)]
*  Like, what if we took the show on the road? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7643.179999999999s)]
*  Right. So that's how this idea of pro [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7645.299999999999s)]
*  wrestling out of the carnival started to happen. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7647.74s)]
*  It's really interesting because wrestling itself is one of the most dynamic and [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7649.54s)]
*  difficult amateur sports, but they never really figured out a way to take actual [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7654.1s)]
*  competitive wrestling and make it a legitimate professional sport that's [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7660.3s)]
*  watched by people, which is really insane because it's so exciting. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7664.86s)]
*  Yeah. So many people don't play tennis, but they still enjoy watching tennis. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7668.74s)]
*  That's right. How is it that wrestling never got to that place? [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7672.9s)]
*  And I think it's probably because of the carnival wrestling, pro wrestling became [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7677.139999999999s)]
*  a thing that everybody kind of knew was entertainment. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7683.299999999999s)]
*  Yes. And it became all these characters and killer [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7686.0599999999995s)]
*  Kowalski and all these guys that were like, you know, I'm going to rip his throat out [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7689.98s)]
*  and shit down his neck. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7694.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7696.9s)]
*  And the crowd goes nuts. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7698.099999999999s)]
*  And to try to have just actual, like, [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7699.78s)]
*  freestyle wrestling become a sport where you're competing for cash prizes [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7703.1s)]
*  like you would do with tennis or something else. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7709.9400000000005s)]
*  I never made it there, which doesn't make any sense to me because so many people [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7712.26s)]
*  wrestle, so many people appreciate wrestling. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7715.26s)]
*  Wrestling is the cornerstone of MMA. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7717.620000000001s)]
*  It's one of the most important. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7719.860000000001s)]
*  I think the most important because if a guy is a kickboxer and he doesn't know how [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7722.14s)]
*  to wrestle, wrestlers are just going to take him down and beat the fuck out of him [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7725.620000000001s)]
*  every single fight. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7728.38s)]
*  Wrestlers decide whether the fight stands or goes to the ground. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7729.46s)]
*  Because once they grip you, you ain't doing shit. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7732.98s)]
*  That's right. You're going to get ragdolled. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7735.7s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7737.099999999999s)]
*  And for whatever reason, boxing has a legitimate professional application. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7738.0599999999995s)]
*  There's even professional karate. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7742.94s)]
*  There's all these different things. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7744.5s)]
*  But wrestling as a competition, an actual athletic competition, never took [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7745.78s)]
*  traction professionally. No, it didn't. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7750.46s)]
*  And as you were saying, I think the cachet and the entertainment value just started [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7752.98s)]
*  to become more appealing, I think, to people. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7757.58s)]
*  And if you think about it back in the early 1920s and 30s [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7759.54s)]
*  and at that time where fucking times were tough and people were trying to stretch [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7762.7s)]
*  the dollar, what do I want to go see? [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7766.86s)]
*  I want to go see this wrestling event. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7768.66s)]
*  It feels like plus those matches. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7769.98s)]
*  They would work those matches where they're fucking hour, hour and a half, [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7772.139999999999s)]
*  like a long matches too as well. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7775.5s)]
*  Crazy. But I will say one of the most important elements, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7777.5s)]
*  which I know you'll appreciate and a lot of MMA fighters appreciate is the, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7780.86s)]
*  as you say, the corner wrestling is a cornerstone of MMA, but also [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7785.46s)]
*  for decades and decades and decades and even still today, [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7789.62s)]
*  having a great base of wrestling is important, even though there's antics [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7795.9800000000005s)]
*  and showmanship and this guy's jumping off this thing and going to the building [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7800.7s)]
*  and bringing the car in and doing all this shit. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7804.22s)]
*  There's still the basics of wrestling is always very important because, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7806.9800000000005s)]
*  as you know, with catch wrestling, like it taught a lot of rest and myself [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7810.5s)]
*  included because I came up old school to have real respect for the holds [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7815.18s)]
*  and to be able to get out of holds, put people in holds, know how to work them [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7820.9400000000005s)]
*  or know how to apply them where you fuck someone up if you had to. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7825.42s)]
*  So I always appreciate that about the basics of pro wrestling. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7828.900000000001s)]
*  Did you ever amateur wrestle? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7833.62s)]
*  So, dude, yes. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7835.5s)]
*  So especially in Pennsylvania, I got there in Allentown, [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7837.740000000001s)]
*  the whole area in Pennsylvania, you know, like they're great wrestlers [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7841.1s)]
*  coming out of Pennsylvania and Ohio. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7844.42s)]
*  But I love pro wrestling. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7847.58s)]
*  So I was 15 years old wrestling coach, who was also the football coach, [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7849.14s)]
*  was like, would you come out for wrestling? [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7853.02s)]
*  You come from a wrestling family. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7855.3s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, great. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7856.9s)]
*  I had this thought in my head. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7858.26s)]
*  I'm going to fucking kill this. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7859.74s)]
*  I've already got my I've already my dad was working my ass out on the mats [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7861.9s)]
*  when I was five, right, and the Von Erics were working me out when I was five. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7865.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. And so I had this base holds, lockups, everything. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7869.54s)]
*  And my first wrestling practice, I was like, fuck, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7874.740000000001s)]
*  this is the most boring shit I've ever felt. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7879.06s)]
*  And I told my guys, I was like, guys, I don't like this because I was just so [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7883.9800000000005s)]
*  now conditioned. Now, of course, it's the hardest fucking sport out there. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7888.54s)]
*  It's the hardest, hardest fucking sport. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7891.820000000001s)]
*  I have so much respect for it. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7893.780000000001s)]
*  But you know what it was? It was just me at 15. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7895.26s)]
*  Dude, I love the pile drivers. Right. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7897.9400000000005s)]
*  I love the bad guys. I want to be a pro wrestler. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7900.22s)]
*  I get it. I get it. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7902.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's it would have been an interesting turn of events. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7904.5s)]
*  You want to go on Pride. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7907.78s)]
*  Oh, did you have an idea where you were going to train? [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7910.3s)]
*  I had no idea. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7912.78s)]
*  I was just I felt like I'm spinning here. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7914.18s)]
*  Did you have any experience in striking a little bit? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7917.1s)]
*  Very little. My dad was a great amateur boxer. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7920.14s)]
*  He sparred with Foreman. Wow. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7923.0199999999995s)]
*  A few times sparred with Ali. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7925.5s)]
*  That was a little bit more of a show. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7927.1s)]
*  Great amateur. Golden Gloves in Canada. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7928.66s)]
*  He was a badass. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7930.94s)]
*  So he was teaching me how to hit at a young age. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7931.74s)]
*  Heavy bag, speed bag, things like that. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7934.139999999999s)]
*  I had a little bit. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7936.42s)]
*  And I felt like I've always been [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7937.299999999999s)]
*  I've always been very coachable in whatever it is that I did, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7940.94s)]
*  whether it's football, wrestling, track, whatever it is. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7944.38s)]
*  So I felt like, hey, I'm going to go into this if there's a shot at this [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7947.34s)]
*  and I could go to Pride and make money. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7950.299999999999s)]
*  By the way, I just I had this thought of Pride because it felt like, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7952.78s)]
*  oh, those guys there, they're making money. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7955.66s)]
*  They're putting on these big shows. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7957.219999999999s)]
*  There's 20, 30,000 people in these shows. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7958.58s)]
*  This looks incredible. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7960.54s)]
*  And not only that, but then I think when you're talking to guys [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7962.1s)]
*  and they're in it and they're saying, yeah, you could do it. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7964.74s)]
*  You could do it. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7967.54s)]
*  You know, [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7968.74s)]
*  Shamrock was very smart, by the way, which I really appreciate about him. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7970.86s)]
*  And at that time, we were wrestling each other every night. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7974.22s)]
*  So I got a chance to get to know him very well and work out with him. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7976.62s)]
*  And he was just like, [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7979.5s)]
*  you might just stick with this first. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7981.78s)]
*  Like, there's a real shot here. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7983.94s)]
*  Like, you got something here. Stick with this. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7985.18s)]
*  And if you remember, he started in pro wrestling. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7987.18s)]
*  Yep. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7988.94s)]
*  And then went over when you were there in the early days of the UFC. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7989.66s)]
*  Yeah, he was dominant in MMA in the early days. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7993.42s)]
*  He was one of the first guys to figure out conditioning. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7995.54s)]
*  His gym, the Lions Den, was notorious for being absolutely brutal [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=7998.139999999999s)]
*  with their strength and conditioning routines. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8004.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8006.0599999999995s)]
*  They would put people through a fucking gauntlet to join that team. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8006.66s)]
*  And it was one of the most difficult teams to join. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8010.299999999999s)]
*  It was they were like legendary sessions that they would put you through. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8012.62s)]
*  They would try to break you. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8016.46s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8017.98s)]
*  And he would just try to let you know, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8018.62s)]
*  like, the worst thing you want to be in a fight is tired. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8020.34s)]
*  And you are going to get tired as fuck training with us so that the fight is [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8023.3s)]
*  going to be easy. Easy. Yeah. Wow. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8027.42s)]
*  And they develop some amazing fighters. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8029.78s)]
*  So many the early days of MMA, his brother Frank, he was one of the very best. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8032.0199999999995s)]
*  He was one of the very best complete MMA fighters, in my opinion, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8037.259999999999s)]
*  the first truly complete MMA fighter we saw and a guy with insane cardio. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8040.58s)]
*  Insane. And that was one of the things [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8045.54s)]
*  about Frank is that he could just fucking go forever. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8046.78s)]
*  And he like when he beat Tito Ortiz, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8049.62s)]
*  beat Tito was much bigger than him, stronger than him. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8051.58s)]
*  And he just overwhelmed him with volume and cardio and eventually beat his ass. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8054.179999999999s)]
*  I remember that. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8058.219999999999s)]
*  It was that taught Tito a giant lesson. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8058.94s)]
*  He was in crazy shape, too. Crazy. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8061.46s)]
*  Both of them. Yeah. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8063.46s)]
*  Frank and Ken. Yeah. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8065.42s)]
*  And Frank was fighting. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8066.78s)]
*  I mean, he had been training for like a year and a half and he was fighting in Japan. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8067.98s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, just insane, insane. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8071.58s)]
*  But he was just a quick learner and just fully committed. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8074.18s)]
*  And by the time he became UFC champion, I mean, he he just had an arsenal of skills. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8077.06s)]
*  Yeah, he was he was the first truly complete MMA fighter and people for whatever [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8082.58s)]
*  reason, they forgot how good he was. Yeah. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8087.02s)]
*  But he was he was, in my opinion, the first real complete, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8088.9800000000005s)]
*  yes, like fully well rounded submission artist. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8093.22s)]
*  He could knock you out. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8096.38s)]
*  He was a dog in a fight. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8097.66s)]
*  Just incredible conditioning, built like a god. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8099.38s)]
*  Yeah, he was the first. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8102.42s)]
*  He was the first. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8103.66s)]
*  Let me ask you this about these guys. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8104.46s)]
*  Say, for example, to take Frank Shamrock, Ken Shamrock. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8106.42s)]
*  I know I love that guy, Mark Kerr, who I've gotten to know very well. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8109.3s)]
*  You think these guys, I don't want to say [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8112.82s)]
*  were they ahead of their time because they were all founding fathers. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8114.98s)]
*  Yeah, they're pioneers, pioneers, man. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8118.78s)]
*  How do you think those guys would fare today? [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8121.3s)]
*  Even with their the insane mindset that those guys had. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8124.14s)]
*  Right. I feel like with the different kind [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8128.06s)]
*  of coaching, how they were coached back then, I feel like they would still. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8129.7s)]
*  Dominate, I feel like all champions have a quality that in any era [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8134.78s)]
*  depended upon the skill level of that area era, they would rise to whatever that skill level is. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8141.099999999999s)]
*  Yes, what's going on today is you've got guys with one, two fights in the UFC [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8147.26s)]
*  that are elite fighters, they might have 30 amateur fights, 11. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8153.66s)]
*  Yeah, you're getting these guys that are competing now that are first fight in the UFC. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8158.38s)]
*  They're world class. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8163.06s)]
*  You see how smooth and technical they are. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8164.900000000001s)]
*  You're like, Jesus Christ, these guys are so good. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8168.02s)]
*  Back then, that wasn't the case. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8170.54s)]
*  So you could get away with a lot more and you didn't have as high a bar to aspire to. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8172.5s)]
*  But champions rise to the level of competition that's around them. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8178.1s)]
*  That's right. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8182.42s)]
*  And I think guys like Frank Shamrock or Ken Shamrock or Hoist Gracie, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8183.1s)]
*  they would rise today. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8187.54s)]
*  They would all rise today because they're champions. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8188.74s)]
*  There's a mindset. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8191.06s)]
*  They would just have to do things differently and they would have to check leg kicks. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8192.58s)]
*  In what way? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8196.62s)]
*  They would have to know every aspect of it. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8197.42s)]
*  Like Hoist in the beginning, very little striking. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8200.3s)]
*  He would just kind of throw kicks just to try to get a clinch and get a hold of you. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8202.54s)]
*  And his Jiu Jitsu was so superior to everybody's that once he got you to the [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8206.38s)]
*  ground, you were fucked. But that's not good enough today. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8209.98s)]
*  Like now everyone's a black belt in Jiu Jitsu. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8213.22s)]
*  Now everyone knows how to move on the ground. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8215.42s)]
*  Now everyone knows how to defend and everyone has nasty stand up. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8217.74s)]
*  And you have to have everything today. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8221.3s)]
*  But Hoist would have developed that. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8223.259999999998s)]
*  He would have. He's a champion. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8225.019999999999s)]
*  There's a mindset of someone who can win one of those gigantic tournaments that he [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8226.66s)]
*  won like in the early days, fighting guys, 270 pounds. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8231.82s)]
*  We fought Dan Severn. Dan Severn was giant. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8235.099999999999s)]
*  He catches them in a triangle. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8237.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8239.42s)]
*  Hoist is a champion. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8240.099999999999s)]
*  Multiple fights at night. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8240.9s)]
*  Multiple fights at night. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8241.939999999999s)]
*  Multiple fights. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8242.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8243.42s)]
*  Yeah. Champions are champions. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8244.179999999998s)]
*  And the thing is, the level of competition today is so high that it's like there's [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8246.099999999999s)]
*  more required of everyone. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8252.14s)]
*  But I feel like champions are a very unique breed of individual and champions [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8253.939999999999s)]
*  would rise in any era because they would figure out what they need to do in [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8259.06s)]
*  accordance to like what's the competition and who's around them. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8263.779999999999s)]
*  And they would rise to that occasion. That's right. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8266.259999999998s)]
*  That's what I think. It's the capacity that they have. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8267.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they have. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8270.14s)]
*  And back then nobody knew. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8271.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, Marco Huas was the first guy to show us leg kicks. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8272.3s)]
*  We were like, Jesus Christ, this guy is just chopping at Paul Varlin's legs. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8275.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8278.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8279.22s)]
*  Marco was like 220 pounds and Paul Varlin's the polar bear. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8279.619999999999s)]
*  He was huge. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8283.619999999999s)]
*  Huge. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8284.38s)]
*  It's like 300 plus. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8285.26s)]
*  And Marco is just kicking his legs, kicking his legs. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8286.9s)]
*  And eventually a guy collapses and we're like, oh, my God, you can kick the legs. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8289.06s)]
*  Yeah. And then it became a thing. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8292.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8294.019999999999s)]
*  Everybody started kicking legs. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8294.5s)]
*  And then Pedro Hizzo comes around and he's the most devastating leg kicker. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8295.9s)]
*  And there was these guys that learn from what they're seeing around them. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8299.300000000001s)]
*  And you see that now we're talking about the calf kick. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8303.7s)]
*  Relatively new thing in MMA, but it's devastating and everyone does it now. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8306.34s)]
*  And if you don't know it and you don't know how to check it, you're fucked. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8312.380000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8315.460000000001s)]
*  One or two kicks to the calf and your legs useless. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8315.86s)]
*  And done. Right. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8318.380000000001s)]
*  Foot goes numb. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8319.22s)]
*  Yeah. Your leg doesn't move. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8320.14s)]
*  You can't stand on it right. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8321.78s)]
*  So you're compromising. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8323.66s)]
*  So all your balance is on your left leg now because your right leg's fucked. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8324.7s)]
*  So you switch stances and you put your left leg forward. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8327.660000000002s)]
*  Now that gets kicked. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8330.5s)]
*  And you're trying not to show your shit. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8331.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8335.34s)]
*  Trying to keep a poker face. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8335.980000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8337.42s)]
*  Do you think it ever goes back to at any point where it's different weight classes [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8338.54s)]
*  against each other? It could. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8343.26s)]
*  Some wild organization in Russia, I'm sure, is doing that right now. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8345.54s)]
*  There's always someone who's trying. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8349.060000000001s)]
*  Japan did a lot of that. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8350.460000000001s)]
*  They have some crazy freak shows. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8351.94s)]
*  That was the thing about Japan. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8353.5s)]
*  They love to put like Bob Sapp, 350 pounds of solid muscle, and they put him [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8354.62s)]
*  against Minotauro, who's the champion, who was like 220. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8360.26s)]
*  Yeah. Natural. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8364.3s)]
*  You know, just but Minotauro won. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8365.5s)]
*  It was one of those cases where Jiu Jitsu [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8367.34s)]
*  prevailed over a larger, scarier opponent. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8368.98s)]
*  But there's a moment in that fight where [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8371.74s)]
*  Bob Sapp at the beginning of the fight pile drives Minotauro. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8373.5s)]
*  I remember that. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8376.62s)]
*  And he fucked his neck up for years. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8377.02s)]
*  His neck was probably never the same again after that fight. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8379.18s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8381.66s)]
*  You know, I played against Bob Sapp. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8382.5s)]
*  In football? Yeah. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8385.5s)]
*  Yeah, he was a fucking giant. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8386.62s)]
*  Giant like a like a cartoon. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8389.02s)]
*  He didn't even look like a real person. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8391.18s)]
*  And the body. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8392.5s)]
*  Yeah. Abs. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8393.5s)]
*  370 with abs. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8394.78s)]
*  Yes. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8395.9s)]
*  Yeah, you would see him and you would go, what? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8396.460000000001s)]
*  Like he was across the ring in Pride. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8398.3s)]
*  That's what they loved. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8399.94s)]
*  They loved that freak show aspect of it, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8400.98s)]
*  that Bob Sapp standing over there just not even looking like a human being, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8403.7s)]
*  looking like a character in an Avengers movie. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8407.78s)]
*  Look at the size of him. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8410.86s)]
*  This is the this is the round one. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8411.98s)]
*  So this is Bob Sapp. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8413.619999999999s)]
*  So Minotauro shoots for a shot. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8414.779999999999s)]
*  Bob Sapp picks him up, drops him on his head, bro, on his fucking head. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8416.42s)]
*  God. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8422.06s)]
*  Insane. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8422.98s)]
*  And Minotauro has got to be an ag. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8423.5s)]
*  He's going to get it. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8425.14s)]
*  Yeah, but he got a hold of the leg this time to stop that. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8426.26s)]
*  But I mean, it went back and forth. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8429.699999999999s)]
*  And then Minotauro, he hits the switch and eventually gets on top of Bob Sapp [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8431.42s)]
*  at the end of the fight and gets him in an armbar. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8436.06s)]
*  But it was a grueling encounter. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8437.74s)]
*  Yes. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8439.38s)]
*  Spent a lot of time on his back getting beaten up by this enormous, super powerful [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8439.820000000002s)]
*  incredible. And then did Bob gas out like Bob gas out. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8444.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, Bob was so big. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8447.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, the cardiovascular requirements of someone who's that big. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8449.18s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8451.900000000001s)]
*  But also Minotauro's Jiu Jitsu was next level. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8453.54s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Just super next level. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8456.140000000001s)]
*  He was really one of the first Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belts to have an elite [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8457.900000000001s)]
*  guard. So like when you were on if you were on top and he was on his back, [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8461.820000000002s)]
*  you were in still dangerous waters. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8467.02s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8469.26s)]
*  Because this guy was just an elite black belt in Jiu Jitsu. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8470.18s)]
*  And for Jiu Jitsu, when he caught him in this armbar, it was the biggest win ever. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8474.26s)]
*  I remember me and my friends are watching this. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8478.82s)]
*  After coming back from that. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8480.62s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8481.460000000001s)]
*  Me and my friends are watching this. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8482.18s)]
*  And when he catches him in this armbar and he eventually gets it, we fucking jumped [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8483.54s)]
*  up and cheered because like fucking Jiu Jitsu. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8487.82s)]
*  Yeah. Right away. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8490.82s)]
*  And we're like, no way. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8492.62s)]
*  He did it. He fucking did it. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8494.06s)]
*  He was our hero. He was the Jiu Jitsu hero. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8495.42s)]
*  Really? [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8497.58s)]
*  Yeah. Minotaro Noguera was the hero for sure. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8498.06s)]
*  Because he represented Jiu Jitsu against the worst case scenario. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8500.859999999999s)]
*  A fucking super athlete. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8504.38s)]
*  Yes. A person that didn't even look like a person. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8506.18s)]
*  Just dumped you on your fucking head, by the way. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8508.18s)]
*  A massive guy who was battering him, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8510.019999999999s)]
*  beating him up and slamming him on the ground. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8512.5s)]
*  And he prevailed with skill. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8514.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8516.38s)]
*  Like Minotaro, that guy would be a champion today. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8518.06s)]
*  He'd be a champion in any era. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8519.939999999999s)]
*  Yes. Just champions. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8521.34s)]
*  Fedor would be a champion in any era. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8522.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8524.58s)]
*  There's guys like that that are just special. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8524.98s)]
*  They're special people. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8526.779999999999s)]
*  Did you wish that he had his run in UFC? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8527.66s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8531.7s)]
*  What happened there? [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8532.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8533.26s)]
*  There's a lot of different versions of the story. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8534.02s)]
*  There's a lot of characters in Russia that were connected to Fedor that wanted [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8536.539999999999s)]
*  they had some heavy requirements of what they wanted from the UFC. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8543.14s)]
*  And the UFC wasn't willing to give it to them. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8546.66s)]
*  And it got pretty testy. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8548.42s)]
*  It got dangerous. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8550.3s)]
*  It got, you know, there's some real people over there. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8552.38s)]
*  Yes. Some real dudes. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8555.06s)]
*  But, you know, I feel like that's it. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8556.18s)]
*  It reminds me that's just that's the fight business. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8557.98s)]
*  That's really the fight business for Russia, too. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8560.460000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8562.62s)]
*  These are hard men. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8563.18s)]
*  And Fedor was the hardest. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8564.42s)]
*  That motherfucker never changed his expression. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8565.7s)]
*  He was beating people into a bloody pulp. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8567.86s)]
*  And he looked like he was sipping tea. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8569.82s)]
*  The same. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8571.1s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8572.140000000001s)]
*  He was a special guy. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8573.5s)]
*  That mentality. Oh, my God. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8575.02s)]
*  He was a special guy. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8576.34s)]
*  He fought Kevin Randleman and Kevin Randleman suplexed him on his neck, [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8577.58s)]
*  just threw him through the air and slammed him on his neck. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8581.58s)]
*  And within moments afterwards, Fedor had him in an arm bar. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8584.02s)]
*  Moments afterwards, you know, just the machine. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8587.46s)]
*  He was a machine and stoic, stoic and deceiving, deceptively. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8590.14s)]
*  Right. Because even Kevin Randleman, just the body. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8595.34s)]
*  You know, these guys who look like a gazillion dollars. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8597.82s)]
*  God, a god. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8600.859999999999s)]
*  And you have Fedor who just like a fucking sloppy body. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8601.9s)]
*  Looked like he just ate a bunch of potatoes and drank beer. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8605.859999999999s)]
*  Big old roll of fat just fucked everybody up. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8609.18s)]
*  So here's the fight. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8611.98s)]
*  You look at Fedor, that does not look like the best fighter in the world. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8612.78s)]
*  When you look at his body. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8615.900000000001s)]
*  Unbelievable. But if you look at his movements, [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8616.900000000001s)]
*  his movements were fucking perfect. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8618.74s)]
*  Yes. He had such good striking, too. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8620.300000000001s)]
*  And he was so elite on the ground. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8622.78s)]
*  And he was one of the first, you know, guys who could do everything. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8625.140000000001s)]
*  Ground and pound. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8629.74s)]
*  Stand up. Blast you standing up. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8630.86s)]
*  Now, here's the slam. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8633.220000000001s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8634.58s)]
*  This is the beginning of the fight. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8635.7s)]
*  But at one point in time, Fedor figures out a way to get up and then [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8636.66s)]
*  Randleman suplexes him. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8639.900000000001s)]
*  And when he suplexed him right here, [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8641.140000000001s)]
*  right on his neck, boom. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8642.78s)]
*  I mean, but look, Fedor just immediately rolls. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8645.140000000001s)]
*  Yep. Ate it. He's good. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8648.140000000001s)]
*  And so they get into this scramble. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8649.54s)]
*  And this is back when you could throw knees to the head on the ground to pride. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8651.300000000001s)]
*  But look, you reversed him. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8654.26s)]
*  So show how you reversed him because it was fucking beautiful. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8655.900000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8658.820000000002s)]
*  So Randleman, who is an elite wrestler, [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8659.7s)]
*  you got to imagine what kind of skill it takes to be able to reverse a guy like [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8661.980000000001s)]
*  that, you know, a real elite college wrestler. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8665.74s)]
*  You see that fucked up leg? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8669.1s)]
*  Yeah. See the veins in his legs? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8670.34s)]
*  That's from a fight with Pedro Hizzo. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8672.1s)]
*  Pedro Hizzo would kick your legs so hard that all your arteries would burst. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8673.9s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8677.5s)]
*  And guys would get compartment syndrome in their leg where their leg would fill [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8678.14s)]
*  up with blood and it would take them like six months to recover from a Pedro Hizzo [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8681.42s)]
*  fight. Wow. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8684.9s)]
*  Yeah. Pedro Hizzo was the scariest fucking leg kicker that ever fought in the sport. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8685.98s)]
*  And look at this immediately locks up a [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8690.42s)]
*  camora and that's it. That's a wrap. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8692.18s)]
*  That was Fedor. And look, never changes expression. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8694.22s)]
*  And even when he wins, nothing, nothing, no yeehaw. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8697.699999999999s)]
*  No fuck yeah. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8701.34s)]
*  Look at as he's getting slammed. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8702.74s)]
*  Oh, I mean, right on his fucking neck, man. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8704.98s)]
*  And then catches him in the camora. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8710.34s)]
*  I mean, that was Fedor. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8713.62s)]
*  He figured out a way to win against anybody. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8715.06s)]
*  And for a period of time, he was the greatest ever. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8717.34s)]
*  I don't know. Yes. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8720.66s)]
*  You got to look at guys when they're at their best. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8721.94s)]
*  And Fedor in pride was one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8724.82s)]
*  heavyweight ever. Yes. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8729.66s)]
*  Yeah. He was a monster. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8731.42s)]
*  I always wish he had that run. I do, too. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8732.82s)]
*  Him versus Brock Lesnar would have been fucking insane. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8735.02s)]
*  It would have been fucking insane. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8738.94s)]
*  Versus Kane Velasquez would have been fucking insane when Kane was at the top. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8741.46s)]
*  Kane's another one. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8746.14s)]
*  There's an argument when Kane was at his very best, like when he beat Brock, when [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8747.18s)]
*  Kane was just destroying everybody, there's an argument that he's the greatest. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8751.06s)]
*  But his run was less because he was so tough that he broke his body. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8754.86s)]
*  He was just so mentally tough. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8759.66s)]
*  He just fucking pushed so hard. Pushed in terms of training. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8761.66s)]
*  Yeah. Tore his knees, his shoulder, his back, everything. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8764.06s)]
*  Everything just started giving out. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8767.18s)]
*  And then it got to a certain point in his life where he just like his body just [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8768.78s)]
*  didn't perform anymore. Yeah. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8772.86s)]
*  And that was it. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8774.42s)]
*  I mean, he has multiple surgeries. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8775.58s)]
*  He had a bunch of things wrong with him. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8777.14s)]
*  And he just couldn't train like he used to be able to train anymore. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8778.7s)]
*  And that was it. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8781.42s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8782.82s)]
*  I remember that with a guy like that. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8783.82s)]
*  How much of that is coach compared to him? [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8785.22s)]
*  Ultimately, he'll make the decision to train, I believe, and push himself. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8789.46s)]
*  But at what point you think coaches step in and say, it's hard to say, because Kane [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8793.3s)]
*  is another one that was so stoic and he would never complain. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8797.859999999999s)]
*  And also the training sessions. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8801.26s)]
*  Yeah. And the training says, I mean, him [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8803.859999999999s)]
*  and DC were just going to war all the time. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8805.46s)]
*  And A.K.A. was just this talent filled shark tank of a bunch of assassins just [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8808.3s)]
*  beating the fuck out of each other and just all iron sharpens iron. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8814.14s)]
*  And you're going to get banged up. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8818.42s)]
*  You're going to get banged up in training. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8819.62s)]
*  You're going to get banged up in these fights against guys like, you know, [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8820.98s)]
*  these fucking huge super athlete fighters, you're going to get banged up. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8824.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8829.06s)]
*  And but in that time, when he like when he beat Minotauro, Jesus Christ, [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8829.74s)]
*  this is this is like when you could see the levels of competition as they pull up [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8835.22s)]
*  Kane Velasquez versus Minotauro, because this, in my opinion, [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8841.5s)]
*  this is prime Kane Velasquez when he just seemed unstoppable [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8845.380000000001s)]
*  because he was a heavyweight, but he had the cardio of a welterweight. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8849.18s)]
*  Yeah. And he had speed and precision and he never was out of position. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8852.42s)]
*  Everything he threw, he just threw precise and perfect and technical. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8857.14s)]
*  And he was so fucking game. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8861.3s)]
*  And when you watch it, look at his leg kicks. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8863.78s)]
*  I mean, he was so fucking smooth. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8865.7s)]
*  Yeah. Everything he did was precise. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8867.66s)]
*  Like the way he's throwing these [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8870.26s)]
*  combinations and head kicks and his defenses on point. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8871.300000000001s)]
*  Kane was a monster in his time. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8874.460000000001s)]
*  And like in this time, like this came Velasquez. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8877.26s)]
*  I put this came Velasquez against anybody that's ever lived. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8879.86s)]
*  Yeah. And I would love to see it. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8882.26s)]
*  He was so fucking good. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8883.74s)]
*  He was so good. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8885.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8887.66s)]
*  And then he lost to Junior dos Santos. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8888.86s)]
*  But what a lot of people don't know is that was like the first fight on Fox. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8890.54s)]
*  It was like this big, big fight. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8893.74s)]
*  I remember that. And Kane tore his knee before that fight. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8895.54s)]
*  His knee was fucked up. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8898.54s)]
*  Oh, he's really look at this. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8899.86s)]
*  Look at that combination. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8900.78s)]
*  That's Kane. That was Kane at his best. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8903.18s)]
*  That's the fucking that's the lead Kane. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8906.02s)]
*  He was a monster monster. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8908.66s)]
*  Everybody's terrified of that guy. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8910.7s)]
*  He never got tired. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8912.220000000001s)]
*  They call him Cardio Kane. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8913.54s)]
*  Never got tired. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8915.1s)]
*  Yeah. Never got tired. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8916.140000000001s)]
*  And he could just remember that Arizona. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8917.460000000001s)]
*  I want to say Arizona State or he came out of Arizona State and went to AKA to begin [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8919.54s)]
*  his MMA career and just was a monster and was like nothing anybody had ever seen. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8925.42s)]
*  You guys would get this thousand yard stare in their eyes when they'd be in like [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8930.46s)]
*  the second round with him. They just they couldn't believe they had four more rounds [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8934.019999999999s)]
*  to go. This is fucking insane. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8937.98s)]
*  Yes. And that guy. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8939.619999999999s)]
*  And he's not breathing heavy. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8940.58s)]
*  No, just just just fucking marching you down, beating your ass. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8942.019999999999s)]
*  Who's next big heavyweight star? [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8946.46s)]
*  Tom Aspinall, the guy who just won the interim title. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8950.58s)]
*  He's phenomenal. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8953.699999999999s)]
*  And he is, again, the next [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8954.82s)]
*  the next advancement of the evolution of the sport. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8957.7s)]
*  How so? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8961.34s)]
*  Well, because he can do everything. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8962.02s)]
*  That guy's got elite jujitsu. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8963.619999999999s)]
*  He's got elite takedowns. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8965.46s)]
*  His striking is outstanding. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8966.9s)]
*  I mean, he knocked out Sergey, who's the scariest fucking striker in all of MMA. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8968.539999999999s)]
*  And he knocked him out in the first round. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8973.58s)]
*  And the way he did it was just picture perfect. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8975.539999999999s)]
*  And he did it with a fucked up back. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8977.78s)]
*  He fucked his back up and wasn't able to train for like like he fucked his back up [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8979.539999999999s)]
*  in one of the sessions when he was because he only got the fight call two [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8984.18s)]
*  weeks before the event. I was just going to say, right? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8987.62s)]
*  Like it's just he didn't even train early. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8988.98s)]
*  He didn't even train. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8991.18s)]
*  He couldn't train. He couldn't train. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8992.62s)]
*  Couldn't train. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8994.18s)]
*  So he just went out there and fought. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8995.26s)]
*  He just said, let me let my back heal up. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8996.78s)]
*  I'm fit enough. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=8999.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in shape enough. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9000.5s)]
*  I'll do whatever I can do in training. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9001.5s)]
*  But he couldn't wrestle. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9003.14s)]
*  Yeah, he couldn't, you know, couldn't do much sparring. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9004.14s)]
*  His back was fucked up. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9006.460000000001s)]
*  So he had to kind of let it heal as much as it could in like 10 days and then go out [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9007.42s)]
*  and fight the fucking scariest guy ever. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9011.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9014.34s)]
*  Fucking crazy. Did you call that? [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9015.38s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I knew you called it. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9016.9s)]
*  But did you call? Did you? [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9018.26s)]
*  I had no idea. I had no idea. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9019.779999999999s)]
*  Both of those main events. I had no idea. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9021.26s)]
*  It was like you couldn't. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9023.34s)]
*  Sergey could connect on anybody and put them to sleep. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9025.14s)]
*  He just knocked out Derek Lewis in one round and I got tied to evas. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9027.66s)]
*  Run round. Yes. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9030.82s)]
*  He was a monster. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9031.98s)]
*  And so you watch Sergey and you go, I don't know. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9032.86s)]
*  You watch Aspinal. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9036.58s)]
*  Like I knew Aspinal was going to have a speed advantage because he's faster than [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9037.38s)]
*  any heavyweight. Yeah. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9040.660000000002s)]
*  And that's something that his coach drilled into him when he was young. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9041.7s)]
*  Like be fast. Like you've got to be fast. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9044.5s)]
*  That's what's going to separate you from everybody else. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9047.1s)]
*  Speed kills speed. Yeah. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9048.980000000001s)]
*  And he's a giant dude, 260 plus pounds, but he moves like a fast young guy. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9050.740000000002s)]
*  Like a light guy. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9055.94s)]
*  And so that was that's what's and he's also just so well rounded. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9057.220000000001s)]
*  And he's just beginning. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9060.62s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that was really the first big test of his career. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9061.78s)]
*  He had fought some good guys up until that fight. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9065.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That is the first guy where you're like, boy, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9068.220000000001s)]
*  every fight before that Aspinal was a heavy favorite in my eyes. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9070.94s)]
*  And then that fight I was like, I don't fucking know. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9074.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen here. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9076.98s)]
*  So for him to do that, what he did and to to perform that way under those [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9078.380000000001s)]
*  situations and that circumstance where your back is fucked and you can't really train. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9083.78s)]
*  Incredibly impressive. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9088.5s)]
*  That's incredible, man. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9089.62s)]
*  But I want to go back. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9090.54s)]
*  That's what I want. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9092.74s)]
*  That's the champion. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9093.78s)]
*  I mean, dude, that's the champion. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9094.82s)]
*  Fuck that guy relinquishes his crown. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9096.3s)]
*  And what he did with Tyson Fury is [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9099.06s)]
*  probably one of the greatest performances in combat sports history ever, ever, ever, [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9101.82s)]
*  ever to have that guy go over there with no one gave many chance. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9106.259999999998s)]
*  Terrence Crawford was sitting across where you are right now. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9110.58s)]
*  And he's like, zero chance is going to get knocked out. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9113.14s)]
*  Zero chance. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9115.859999999999s)]
*  And then when he dropped Tyson Fury in the third round and then was battering him [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9117.099999999999s)]
*  in the eighth and then at the tenth round at the end of the fight, you're like, I don't know. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9121.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's going to fucking happen. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9124.46s)]
*  I don't know who won. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9126.02s)]
*  And one judge saw it for him and one judge saw it for in the other two judges saw it [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9127.060000000001s)]
*  for for Fury. But it was that close. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9130.7s)]
*  It was that close where you and a lot of people are saying that this puts Tyson [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9133.58s)]
*  Fury's argument of being one of the greatest of all time in jeopardy. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9137.9s)]
*  Because now people are saying, well, hey, man, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9140.62s)]
*  you got dropped and brought to a questionable decision by a guy with zero [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9142.300000000001s)]
*  boxing matches, which is crazy. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9146.98s)]
*  Yeah. But that's the kind of freak that Francis is. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9149.300000000001s)]
*  He's a freak. He's the freak of all freaks. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9152.54s)]
*  If you're and you've seen Francis up close. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9155.22s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9158.26s)]
*  So, you know, the kind of freak is if you're him and if you're as people, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9159.5s)]
*  what's that what's his next move? [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9163.18s)]
*  Get as much money as you can. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9165.42s)]
*  Of course. This is what I think they should do. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9166.779999999999s)]
*  Put him in with a heavyweight boxer that he could beat that has a good record, [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9169.18s)]
*  like someone who's in the argument of like a top 10. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9174.1s)]
*  And if Francis knocks that guy out, [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9178.34s)]
*  then if they can try to coax Tyson Fury into a rematch, [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9181.1s)]
*  that would be fucking bananas. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9186.58s)]
*  And I think Saudi Arabia has enough money to actually pull that off. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9189.539999999999s)]
*  I think so, too. I think so, too. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9192.14s)]
*  They might be able to fucking bait Tyson in with some just fucking [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9193.38s)]
*  life changing generational money. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9198.22s)]
*  So here's the thing about Tyson and who I love and respect. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9200.14s)]
*  I love that guy, too. There's two train of thoughts here. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9203.1s)]
*  It's either, well, I don't actually need to fight him again. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9205.66s)]
*  Right. There's that train of thought. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9209.5s)]
*  But then I wonder if it goes back to the champion mentality that you talked about [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9211.02s)]
*  is as a champion, I need to fight that guy. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9214.74s)]
*  It may be that he is certainly a champion and he's certainly one of the greatest [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9219.539999999999s)]
*  of all time. And I think he certainly underestimated Francis. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9223.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9228.3s)]
*  And I don't know how he trained for Francis. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9228.9s)]
*  He said he trained as hard as any fight ever, which is possible because he always [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9231.34s)]
*  looks that way. He always like like Fador. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9235.38s)]
*  He has like this very disarming body and he jokes around about it. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9237.22s)]
*  Look at this fucking belly. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9240.94s)]
*  He's a character. I love the guy to death. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9242.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9244.619999999999s)]
*  I think if he knows now what he's up against and he just boxes, just boxes [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9245.14s)]
*  with a real understanding of the consequences of making a mistake, [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9250.58s)]
*  I think it's probably a different fight. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9253.82s)]
*  But if he doesn't engage and just uses [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9255.619999999999s)]
*  that beautiful jab and movement and stays away from him and just does [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9257.74s)]
*  what he does when he's at his very best. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9261.22s)]
*  And one of the things you see from Tyson Fury is when he does have a rematch, [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9263.22s)]
*  he performs so much better. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9266.74s)]
*  Like the Deontay Wilder example, first fight down to the wire, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9268.74s)]
*  gets dropped in the last round. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9272.98s)]
*  It's a draw. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9274.539999999999s)]
*  Second fight dominates. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9275.9s)]
*  Third fight dominates and was put through adversity, dropped. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9277.46s)]
*  I mean, I think he dropped, got dropped four times over the course of their three [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9281.74s)]
*  fights by the hardest fucking one punch knockout artist ever. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9285.18s)]
*  Deontay's got lightning in his hands. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9289.74s)]
*  He just electrocutes people. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9292.539999999999s)]
*  Deontay, he's the greatest knockout artist ever. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9295.98s)]
*  If you look at his career, it's like mostly knockouts. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9298.939999999999s)]
*  That's it. Right. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9302.46s)]
*  And also, too, I feel like tall. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9303.66s)]
*  So as you're tall, your muscles getting elongated, as you know. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9306.179999999998s)]
*  And then it becomes deceptive. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9309.5s)]
*  What's a leverage thing, too, because he's got broad shoulders and insane speed. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9311.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9316.38s)]
*  So when he drops that hand on you, it's just [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9316.859999999999s)]
*  when he turns it over at the end with all that length and torque and leverage. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9320.3s)]
*  Yes. He's like nobody, like nobody. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9324.460000000001s)]
*  He just starches people. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9327.1s)]
*  Yeah. I always go to the Louis Ortiz fight when he cracked him in the head. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9328.7s)]
*  And Ortiz gets up and he's like, what the fuck? [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9331.74s)]
*  He hit him on the forehead. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9334.62s)]
*  Yeah. Hit him on the forehead and just shut the lights out. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9335.66s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9338.34s)]
*  Yeah. Deontay, what Teddy Atlas calls it, Teddy Atlas calls it the eraser. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9339.5s)]
*  He's like, any mistakes that he has, he just erases him with one shot. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9343.460000000001s)]
*  And it's true. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9347.18s)]
*  Like, you can win every round with Deontay and you just zig when you should have [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9347.78s)]
*  zagged and blap. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9352.460000000001s)]
*  And he almost did it to Tyson Fury. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9354.06s)]
*  I was going to say he did. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9355.7s)]
*  He almost did it to any other man. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9357.02s)]
*  It might have been the end, but Tyson is just so game. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9358.62s)]
*  He's just such a fucking warrior. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9362.18s)]
*  He figured out a way to get up and hold. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9363.82s)]
*  And he got dropped again. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9365.82s)]
*  He got back up again and then wound up stopping him after that. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9366.82s)]
*  That's right. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9369.9s)]
*  Yeah. And an amazing, glorious finish [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9370.54s)]
*  to the fight that cemented him as one of the greatest heavyweights of all time. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9373.54s)]
*  I think really to get it back, to really get that reputation back, [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9377.22s)]
*  I think he should fight Francis. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9381.82s)]
*  I really think he should. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9383.66s)]
*  But he probably wants to fight Usyk first, unify the title. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9384.86s)]
*  And then if they come to him with just [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9389.22s)]
*  gigantic banana money, just just cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, like what? [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9391.3s)]
*  How much? Yeah. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9397.1s)]
*  Two hundred million dollars. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9398.26s)]
*  Back what truck up? [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9399.779999999999s)]
*  Fucking crazy like that. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9400.619999999999s)]
*  He might just go, all right. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9402.18s)]
*  And then what you know, the resources are there for that. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9403.699999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They can do whatever the fuck they want. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9406.06s)]
*  They got they got they got the fuck you. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9408.619999999999s)]
*  Fuck you. Fuck you. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9411.3s)]
*  All of your money. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9413.66s)]
*  Fuck everyone. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9415.019999999999s)]
*  They got fuck the planet money. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9416.74s)]
*  And I like that they're putting together that. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9418.779999999999s)]
*  I like that they put together that fight. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9420.619999999999s)]
*  And I like to get that they're putting together a bunch of other fights. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9422.22s)]
*  They're trying to do a lot of crazy shit over there. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9424.619999999999s)]
*  I love it. Good. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9426.699999999999s)]
*  Throw that money out there. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9427.539999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9428.5s)]
*  I love it for the athletes because they're going to get paid. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9429.179999999998s)]
*  Love it for the athletes to get paid. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9431.14s)]
*  And that's why I think with Tyson, it just feels like like just in here, [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9432.699999999999s)]
*  you know, it's a fight that I need just in terms of as champion. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9437.019999999999s)]
*  But mentality. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9441.34s)]
*  Yeah. The champion that's in here, the mana. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9442.3s)]
*  I need to do that again. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9444.619999999999s)]
*  Well, right now it's got to be in his head. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9445.9s)]
*  I mean, he's a sensitive guy. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9448.3s)]
*  I'm sure he's responded to all the criticisms, probably eaten him up, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9450.26s)]
*  probably drives him nuts. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9453.82s)]
*  And I bet you'll see an entirely different Tyson Fury in this next fight. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9455.3s)]
*  In this next fight, you will see a focused fucking assassin. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9459.619999999999s)]
*  Yes. But he's fighting the craftiest heavyweight maybe of all time. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9463.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9467.699999999999s)]
*  Usyk is so slick. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9468.3s)]
*  He is. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9470.66s)]
*  I mean, he's the guy who is trained by the same guy that Lomachenko was trained by. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9471.54s)]
*  So he's got just unbelievable movement. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9475.74s)]
*  His angles, the way he boxes, his fucking feints and movement. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9479.46s)]
*  Total next level. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9483.82s)]
*  Yeah. But he's quite a bit smaller. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9484.98s)]
*  I mean, he's really was a cruiserweight and then went up to heavyweight. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9486.78s)]
*  Yeah. So there's there's, you know, there's money in that fight. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9489.7s)]
*  And I would hope that the winner of that fight then fights Francis, [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9493.1s)]
*  whether Usyk would want to fight Francis, who knows. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9496.26s)]
*  But if Usyk wins, if he beats Tyson Fury, that's pretty incredible. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9498.86s)]
*  Announce the date for the fight. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9503.1s)]
*  February 17th in Saudi Arabia. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9504.34s)]
*  Saudi Arabia going crazy. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9506.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9508.380000000001s)]
*  That's a very, very interesting fight. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9509.26s)]
*  Yes. And although Usyk is smaller, man, that fucking guy is so skilled. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9511.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Those Anthony Joshua fights were insane. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9516.1s)]
*  By the way, Tyson is like 6'9". [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9518.7s)]
*  And Usyk is not that much shorter. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9521.740000000002s)]
*  Well, Usyk is wearing shoes in there and Tyson is not. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9523.78s)]
*  Oh, OK. Tyson is right after the fight and they're standing there staring at each other. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9527.18s)]
*  OK, OK. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9530.220000000001s)]
*  So Tyson's quite a few. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9531.54s)]
*  But it's also his arms are longer. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9532.82s)]
*  Just the reach and distance is such an advantage because you could hit a guy [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9534.74s)]
*  where he can't hit you. Yeah. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9538.74s)]
*  But we were talking about Mike Tyson earlier, that Mike Tyson made his height [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9540.42s)]
*  an advantage because he would come in and bob and weave and you'd be like, oh, [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9544.74s)]
*  Jesus, where's this coming from? [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9548.34s)]
*  This fucking tornado coming at you with [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9549.58s)]
*  punches that just moved way faster than any heavyweight. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9552.42s)]
*  I was going to say any other heavyweight with that kind of speed, quickness? [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9555.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Sure. I don't know. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9560.06s)]
*  I'm asking like, do you know? [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9561.74s)]
*  Right. He's the fastest of all time. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9563.18s)]
*  I feel like he's the fastest. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9564.5s)]
*  The fastest of all. You can go to Ali with his hands. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9565.82s)]
*  Ali had hand speed. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9568.42s)]
*  See Ali, there's Ali before that they forced him into retirement because he [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9569.58s)]
*  wouldn't fight in Vietnam. That Ali, if you go to like the Ali that fought [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9574.42s)]
*  Cleveland, Big Cat Williams, that Ali is one of the greatest of all time. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9578.26s)]
*  I mean, the greatest fucking heavyweight in terms of movement. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9582.74s)]
*  And he could move like Sugar Ray Robinson, but he was a heavyweight. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9587.02s)]
*  Yeah. Tall and switching stances, popping you with a jab. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9591.02s)]
*  You couldn't touch him. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9594.58s)]
*  And he's standing right in front of you with his hands down. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9595.5s)]
*  Yes. That Ali was a different Ali. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9597.98s)]
*  But then they made him take three years off. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9599.82s)]
*  Ali really didn't train for those three years. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9602.02s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't do anything. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9603.94s)]
*  So when he came back against Jerry Quarry all those years later, he's physically [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9605.06s)]
*  he was like soft. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9609.300000000001s)]
*  He didn't look the same like pull up Ali versus Cleveland, Big Cat Williams. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9610.74s)]
*  So this is Ali Ali. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9615.82s)]
*  And this is Ali when there was never a heavyweight like him before. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9618.5s)]
*  There's no one like him and no one knew what to do. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9622.74s)]
*  And Cleveland, Big Cat Williams was a fucking killer. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9625.54s)]
*  He was a bad motherfucker. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9628.54s)]
*  Look how powerful serious knockout artists and Ali would just stand right in front [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9630.460000000001s)]
*  of him and just start tuning him up. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9635.86s)]
*  And he just starts popping him with the jab hooks. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9638.74s)]
*  And Cleveland was just trying his best to close the distance. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9641.38s)]
*  What's happening? Is it freezing? [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9646.14s)]
*  It's a video breaking down the whole. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9648.14s)]
*  Oh, I see that. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9649.78s)]
*  It's not just the fight. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9650.9s)]
*  So it's just doing stop motion while someone's explaining. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9651.98s)]
*  Look at that. Look, jab to the body and then the hook. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9654.22s)]
*  And he's nowhere to be found. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9657.1s)]
*  He catches him in the hook coming in and then immediately off the ropes [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9658.22s)]
*  and out into the center. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9661.26s)]
*  You just couldn't catch him. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9662.5s)]
*  Incredible man. Something special, man. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9664.06s)]
*  And then eventually he starts tuning [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9666.34s)]
*  Cleveland up and drops him a couple of times. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9668.34s)]
*  You know, this is this is the end. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9670.460000000001s)]
*  And then he stands over his hands. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9672.86s)]
*  Look at this bank bank bank and then the right hand. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9674.42s)]
*  Bam. I mean, come on, man. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9678.380000000001s)]
*  Nobody moved like no one, dude. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9680.7s)]
*  But Tyson, could you pull up a picture? [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9682.86s)]

*  Why did you meet Muhammad Ali? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9690.300000000001s)]
*  When I was a kid in New Zealand, I told you my dad was sparring with him. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9691.66s)]
*  So here's a picture of me sitting on his lap. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9695.980000000001s)]

*  I started calling myself the people's champion just to piss people [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9722.74s)]
*  off like I'm your champion, I'm the people's champion and the rock is [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9725.94s)]
*  the people's champion. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9729.5s)]

*  Afterwards, they were waiting to say hello. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9740.140000000001s)]
*  Now, again, I'm going out there. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9743.820000000002s)]
*  I'm grabbing the microphone and the people's champ says, I'm just laying it all in. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9745.220000000001s)]

*  And I say, hey, I just want you to know [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9752.380000000001s)]
*  I if you could let Mohammed know, I call myself the people's champion [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9755.78s)]
*  in a way to pay homage to him out of respect. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9761.380000000001s)]
*  But I'm going around the country saying it and people are shitting on me [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9765.460000000001s)]

*  And I said, I told his wife, so if you could please tell him if he doesn't want [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9771.18s)]
*  me to use this because I know what this meant to him being the people's champion, [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9774.380000000001s)]
*  I won't. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9778.660000000002s)]
*  And she said, he told me to tell you it's yours. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9779.740000000002s)]

*  I was like, I got emotional. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9785.3s)]
*  It was just incredible. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9786.939999999999s)]
*  He was such an important cultural figure because he was the first boxer, [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9787.98s)]
*  a first like professional athlete of the highest regard who stood up and said, [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9792.619999999999s)]
*  the Vietnam War is wrong. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9798.619999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to go fight some Vietcong. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9799.98s)]

*  Call me names. I'm not going over there. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9804.099999999999s)]
*  Not doing it. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9806.42s)]
*  And they took away his livelihood and they did it for three years. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9807.22s)]
*  And when he came back, he was a fucking hero, a cultural hero. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9809.779999999999s)]
*  My parents who were hippies made me what didn't make me. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9813.34s)]
*  But we all watched his rematch with Leon Spinks because it was on TV. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9818.5s)]
*  And it's like, that's how much he transcended boxing, the world of sports. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9822.62s)]
*  He was an important figure for like. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9828.9s)]

*  I'm not going to participate in this. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9844.7s)]
*  This is wrong. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9846.1s)]
*  Yes. And they took away his livelihood. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9846.98s)]
*  And when he came back, he was a hero in a completely different way. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9848.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9853.18s)]

*  It was like because when Leon beat him, it was like, no, no way. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9860.06s)]
*  Then he had the rematch and he beat Leon. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9864.82s)]
*  And it was like, oh, my God, he won. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9866.86s)]

*  You felt it. You felt it. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9870.06s)]
*  And there's a guy, as you said, who stood up and also [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9871.66s)]
*  it's one thing if you stand up, but it's another thing. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9874.74s)]
*  I stand up and the willingness to know I'm going to lose it all. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=9877.38s)]

*  You know, back then it was this is thirty six, you know, in the age of no [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10006.26s)]
*  testosterone replacement. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10010.46s)]
*  Yeah. Larry had taken some time off and, you know, came back for this fight. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10012.3s)]
*  He was still very, very good. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10016.82s)]
*  But Tyson was on another level. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10018.46s)]
*  It was just a level. He was just the new destroyer. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10020.779999999999s)]
*  He was the new Sonny Liston. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10024.019999999999s)]
*  He was the new Joe Lewis. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10026.259999999998s)]
*  He was the new Jack Dempsey. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10027.9s)]
*  He was just something special. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10029.259999999998s)]
*  Yes. And combined also because of his [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10031.259999999998s)]
*  his trainer had all the videos of those guys. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10035.06s)]
*  So he watched all those guys and studied their movement. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10039.1s)]
*  Cuss and Jim Jacobs, who was his his manager, Jim Jacobs, who's a boxing [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10041.859999999999s)]
*  historian, but Mike Tyson was just something different, man. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10047.3s)]
*  He was just something different. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10050.779999999999s)]
*  And when he starts battering Larry and beating Larry up, I mean, it was just [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10053.02s)]
*  even in body language, you could just tell. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10057.74s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it was just seeking destroy. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10059.66s)]
*  Yes. You know, and Larry, any mistake [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10061.9s)]
*  that he made was met with hands that were moving far faster than any boxer he'd [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10064.42s)]
*  ever faced before. [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10068.94s)]
*  But Larry came out in this round and showed that jab. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10070.94s)]
*  This is round three. Yeah. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10073.02s)]
*  This is where you see Larry like when Larry was like 25, he would have given [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10074.38s)]
*  anybody fit. Yes. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10078.3s)]
*  But then Mike catches him, boom, and drops him. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10079.619999999999s)]
*  And Larry's in like real trouble. Yes. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10082.34s)]
*  And I remember watching this as a kid. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10084.66s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God, he's going to get him. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10086.3s)]
*  I can't believe he's going to get him. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10087.5s)]
*  Nobody liked Larry Holmes. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10088.859999999999s)]
*  It was so, so fucked up. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10090.22s)]
*  He never got his just do. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10091.94s)]
*  And then Tyson catches him right here with his right hook. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10093.34s)]
*  Boom, it's like over the top of the head. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10095.82s)]
*  And then when Larry gets up, he's in real trouble. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10098.18s)]
*  And then Tyson closes the show. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10100.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Larry's he was so hurt. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10102.38s)]
*  It was so bad. Like right there, that overhand. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10105.22s)]
*  Right. Yes. Yeah. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10107.3s)]
*  I mean, he's just fucked. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10108.38s)]
*  You know, it's coming. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10109.66s)]
*  And when Mike is coming at you, the punches are coming so fast, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10110.46s)]
*  you can't anticipate what angle they're coming from. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10113.539999999999s)]
*  Boom. And here's the right hand that comes here. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10116.58s)]
*  Boom. And then the second one. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10119.1s)]
*  Boom. That was it. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10120.779999999999s)]
*  How cold. Man. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10123.619999999999s)]
*  That was the legacy making fight for Mike Tyson. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10125.1s)]
*  That was the one where everybody's like, God damn, he might be the greatest ever. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10127.98s)]
*  And he still might be the greatest ever. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10131.539999999999s)]
*  I think Tyson in his prime. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10133.14s)]
*  Damn, I put them up against anybody, [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10135.34s)]
*  than anybody that's ever lived. Yes. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10137.3s)]
*  In his prime. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10139.42s)]
*  I mean, you can't look at Tyson when he lost and Tyson later in his career. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10140.539999999999s)]
*  I feel like you can only keep up that those RPMs when you're fucking after it [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10143.939999999999s)]
*  for so long before you guys lose motivation. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10150.1s)]
*  They lose their body doesn't perform the same way anymore. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10153.46s)]
*  Too many wars, whatever it is. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10156.14s)]
*  But if you look at the Tyson when he was storming the gates, [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10158.18s)]
*  when he was in his prime, [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10161.26s)]
*  like no one ever. And motivating too. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10163.74s)]
*  Oh, my God. I remember watching his fights and just ready to fucking run through a wall. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10165.98s)]
*  Train anything I could do. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10169.5s)]
*  Anything. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10171.34s)]
*  He's just like, what? [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10172.5s)]
*  How is it possible that a person could be that proficient at something? [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10173.58s)]
*  Dude, so at about the time when I was [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10176.38s)]
*  my first amateur wrestling days in high school and all that, again, as you're 15, [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10179.539999999999s)]
*  16, you're looking for a way. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10183.94s)]
*  What's my thing? And you're just thinking about money. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10185.58s)]
*  Like, I want to make money. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10187.42s)]
*  And so I was kind of had a connection to boxing. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10188.58s)]
*  My old man boxed. We watch all the fights. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10190.619999999999s)]
*  Tyson, Michael Spinks, 87, I think, or 88. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10193.26s)]
*  Remember that? Yeah. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10198.38s)]
*  And I think that Spinks was champion. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10199.74s)]
*  Spinks was he was the light heavyweight [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10202.859999999999s)]
*  champion and then he beat Larry Holmes, won the heavyweight title. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10205.26s)]
*  I think he had one version of the heavyweight title. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10208.58s)]
*  I think it was a unification fight. Is that correct? [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10210.82s)]
*  It was the one in like 90 seconds. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10213.5s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10215.54s)]
*  And I remember. And at that time, Mike was coming up. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10216.5s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10218.74s)]
*  Yeah, this was I think Mike said that he [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10220.86s)]
*  fought this with a venereal disease. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10223.300000000001s)]
*  I just thought, [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10226.42s)]
*  I had like gonorrhea or some shit. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10227.7s)]
*  Don't we all? [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10229.98s)]
*  But, you know, Spinks was just terrified going into this fight. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10232.18s)]
*  You saw that in their face off, too. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10236.140000000001s)]
*  You saw it. Right. It was just an execution. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10238.5s)]
*  I mean, Tyson was just and Michael was really just drops him to the body there. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10241.02s)]
*  Michael was really a light heavyweight. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10246.18s)]
*  I mean, he blew up. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10247.78s)]
*  He put on some weight to make it up to heavyweight, [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10249.1s)]
*  but he just never had the kind of power. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10250.94s)]
*  He was an amazing light heavyweight, [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10252.74s)]
*  but at heavyweight, he just did not have the kind of power. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10255.02s)]
*  And here comes the bomb. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10257.54s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10258.82s)]
*  And like a ghost fucking punch, it comes out of nowhere. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10260.140000000001s)]
*  Just a fucking ruthless right hand. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10262.82s)]
*  And that was it. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10266.380000000001s)]
*  So, dude, so during this time in my life, [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10267.26s)]
*  I'm thinking, you know, I got an idea. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10270.060000000001s)]
*  Amateur wrestling, I don't. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10272.7s)]
*  I'm not jiving with. I like pro wrestling. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10274.18s)]
*  My old man has taught me how to box just a little bit. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10276.34s)]
*  That's what I should do. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10279.26s)]
*  Well, I should box because at that time, my eyes were on Michael Spinks. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10280.300000000001s)]
*  And I used to think at that time, even though I got a lot of respect for the game. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10284.9s)]
*  And I always think everybody's got a one punch chance. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10287.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10289.9s)]
*  I was like, I know. I bet you I could work my ass off. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10290.98s)]
*  And in two, three years with the right coaching and discipline and training, [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10293.5s)]
*  I could be up there. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10297.02s)]
*  And if Michael Spinks is heavyweight champion, I got a shot. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10297.94s)]
*  I think I got to do it again. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10301.62s)]
*  I'm fucking 15. [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10303.62s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10305.82s)]
*  I'm like, I got a shot. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10307.460000000001s)]
*  I see this fight. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10309.300000000001s)]
*  And I went, there is no fucking way [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10311.460000000001s)]
*  with Mike Tyson as champion that my dreams of boxing and making money, whatever, come true. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10316.34s)]
*  Where does it go? It goes to getting executed. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10322.58s)]
*  Like if everything goes well, you get executed. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10325.06s)]
*  If all the training goes well and the discipline, the road work, you get executed. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10327.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbde_-KgvTw&t=10332.14s)]
