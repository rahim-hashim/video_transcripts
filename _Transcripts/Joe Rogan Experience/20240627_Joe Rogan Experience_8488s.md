*  greatest, but yeah, a lot's been happening. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=25.32s)]
*  But all good stuff, so nothing to complain about. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=28.0s)]
*  What's been happening? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=31.0s)]
*  What's crazy busy? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=32.0s)]
*  Let's see, in the last three months, four months, been to Mexico twice, El Salvador [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=33.0s)]
*  once, California four or five times, Indonesia for a month, Tahiti, France, Mexico. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=40.2s)]
*  Damn, son. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=49.0s)]
*  World traveler. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=50.0s)]
*  A lot. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=51.0s)]
*  What have you been doing? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=52.0s)]
*  A lot of surfing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=53.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=54.0s)]
*  A lot of surfing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=55.0s)]
*  It's great. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=56.0s)]
*  Is it 100%? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=57.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=58.0s)]
*  Close? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=59.0s)]
*  It's not 100%, but I never thought it would be this good again, honestly. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=60.0s)]
*  It's really, really good. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=64.0s)]
*  I have a slight range of motion that's not as good as the other, which is to be expected, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=65.0s)]
*  but it's great. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=70.0s)]
*  I surf with no brace. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=71.0s)]
*  I snowboard with no brace. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=72.0s)]
*  I go hunting all the time with no brace. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=74.0s)]
*  I never really think about it, which is amazing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=76.0s)]
*  For people that don't know, you were in a snowboarding accident. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=79.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=82.0s)]
*  And you fucking demolished your knee. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=83.0s)]
*  Yeah, I ran right into a tree, wrapped my knee around a tree. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=84.0s)]
*  Always my fear when I see people skiing and snowboarding. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=88.0s)]
*  I quit skiing because of an accident. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=92.0s)]
*  I fucked my knee up and I cracked my shin bone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=95.0s)]
*  I got an insufficiency fracture in the top of my shin bone. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=98.0s)]
*  I was like, that's it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=101.0s)]
*  I'm done. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=103.0s)]
*  I'm done with this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=104.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=105.0s)]
*  I love snowboarding. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=106.0s)]
*  I'm not giving it up. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=107.0s)]
*  But yeah, to answer your question, I'm really happy with the way my knee healed up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=108.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a shitty experience of that whole process. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=113.0s)]
*  How long did it take you to fully heal? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=117.0s)]
*  Probably 18 months. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=119.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=122.0s)]
*  But I was really, really... [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=124.0s)]
*  I followed all the physical therapy and all the protocol. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=126.0s)]
*  I did every single thing I could to help it out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=132.0s)]
*  You rang me and said, let's get some stem cells in your knee. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=136.0s)]
*  I came twice here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=141.0s)]
*  Guys at Ways to Well helped me out with that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=143.0s)]
*  I had great results from that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=146.0s)]
*  I actually felt the difference, which is amazing. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=148.0s)]
*  But it healed great. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=151.0s)]
*  You were saying that was the turning point, the Ways to Well. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=152.0s)]
*  This is one of the things that really pushed you over the edge, where it really felt like it was healing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=155.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=161.0s)]
*  I went to a great surgeon and he does these things all the time with great success. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=162.0s)]
*  I have a lot of friends who've had that exact same surgery from him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=167.0s)]
*  So I was really confident. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=170.0s)]
*  What was the extent of the injury? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=171.0s)]
*  I got full repairs of my ACL and my MCL. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=173.0s)]
*  They both basically blew off. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=176.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=178.0s)]
*  So they took my patellar tendon and split it in thirds and then built new ligaments out of that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=179.0s)]
*  So the MCL and the ACL out of patellar tendon? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=188.0s)]
*  How much does that compromise the patellar tendon? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=189.0s)]
*  It doesn't really. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=192.0s)]
*  Because I had a patellar tendon graft on my left knee and it took forever to heal. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=193.0s)]
*  Where on my right knee, I had a cadaver, which only took like six months. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=201.0s)]
*  I think using a cadaver, you heal much faster. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=205.0s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=206.0s)]
*  Why did they decide to do that with you? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=207.0s)]
*  Just because that specific injury that I had, I spoke to my surgeon, really good guy named Warren Kramer out of California. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=209.0s)]
*  And he said, look, we have a couple of different options here you can choose. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=220.0s)]
*  And he just kind of ran me through and he said if it was my knee, I would use a patellar tendon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=223.0s)]
*  He goes, it'll take longer to heal, but you'll be rock solid. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=227.0s)]
*  And like the way he explained is the patellar tendon is pretty wide and really, really strong. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=230.0s)]
*  So even though you're taking a third from one side and a third from the other side, it doesn't really compromise the integrity of the actual tendon. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=235.0s)]
*  And it's weird the way your body is able to turn that tendon into ligaments. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=243.0s)]
*  That's strange. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=247.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=248.0s)]
*  So they take a tendon and then they make ligaments. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=249.0s)]
*  Well, they like they put it in place where you used to have these ligaments and your body accepts it over time as a ligament. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, with the cadaver thing, one of the weird things is that your body uses it as a scaffolding and then re-proliferates it with its own tissue. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=259.0s)]
*  So it's not like you have this cadaver tendon inside of you. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=268.0s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=273.0s)]
*  Because I have an Achilles tendon. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=274.0s)]
*  That's what it started out with. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=275.0s)]
*  That's what replaced my ACL on my right knee. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=276.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=279.0s)]
*  Some dead dude took his Achilles tendon because your Achilles is 150 percent stronger, apparently, once they do that than the original ACL. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=280.0s)]
*  And then they just screw that sucker in place. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=289.0s)]
*  And dude, I was good to go quick. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=291.0s)]
*  I went to a party without a brace five days later after surgery. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=293.0s)]
*  Wow. I was out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=297.0s)]
*  I was in bad shape for a long time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was with my left knee. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=300.0s)]
*  My left knee was in agony for a long time because they have to saw the fucking piece out of the bone and the piece out of the bone of your shin and screw the both of them in place. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=302.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=310.0s)]
*  I couldn't go on my knees. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=311.0s)]
*  I couldn't do anything if I had to kneel down. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=312.0s)]
*  I couldn't do anything for like a year. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=314.0s)]
*  The pain from waking up after surgery was so brutal. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=316.0s)]
*  I had no idea how bad it was going to be. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=321.0s)]
*  It sucked. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=322.0s)]
*  It's intense. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=323.0s)]
*  Really bad. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah, for me, it was one of the only times I ever took painkillers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=325.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=328.0s)]
*  The painkillers made me feel so stupid. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=329.0s)]
*  It was whatever. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=332.0s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=333.0s)]
*  It was Percocets or Vicodin. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=334.0s)]
*  Can't remember. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=336.0s)]
*  But I remember I sold it to some dude at the pool. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=337.0s)]
*  I love that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah. Some dude is like, I'll take them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=340.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=342.0s)]
*  So I do have some crazy junkie named Jeff. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=343.0s)]
*  Jeff the junkie. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=346.0s)]
*  Jeff the junkie. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=348.0s)]
*  I just threw painkillers in the trash this morning at my hotel. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=349.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=352.0s)]
*  And I remember thinking, I just looked down as I was throwing them in the trash [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=353.0s)]
*  and thinking, man, there's probably people outside right now that would like [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=357.0s)]
*  do something terrible for those painkillers. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=360.0s)]
*  I hate painkillers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=364.0s)]
*  I feel like you're either, you're like in one group or the other [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=366.0s)]
*  where like your body really loves painkillers, or your brain, I guess, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=370.0s)]
*  really loves painkillers or really doesn't. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=374.0s)]
*  I definitely hate painkillers. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=376.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=378.0s)]
*  I didn't take anything from my right knee. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=379.0s)]
*  I didn't take a goddamn thing. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=381.0s)]
*  After the surgery, I was like, I'll just deal with pain. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=383.0s)]
*  I remember what it was like taking them from my left knee. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=385.0s)]
*  I was like, fuck off. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=387.0s)]
*  It doesn't jive with me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=389.0s)]
*  It just makes me, again, I hear opiates are amazing. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=391.0s)]
*  I hear people that take like Oxycontin, they said it's amazing. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=395.0s)]
*  Like, oh my God, it's so wonderful. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=400.0s)]
*  Like I had Peter Berg on the podcast. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=401.0s)]
*  He's the guy that produced that Netflix series Painkiller. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=404.0s)]
*  I listened to that one. It was awesome. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=407.0s)]
*  He's amazing. Peter's amazing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=409.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=410.0s)]
*  But that Painkiller show, it's so eye-opening. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=411.0s)]
*  But he was saying that he took Oxycontin once recreationally. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=415.0s)]
*  And he was like, oh my God, this is so good. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=419.0s)]
*  I can never do this again. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=421.0s)]
*  It just makes you feel so wonderful. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=423.0s)]
*  You feel like you're slowly falling into like a jar of honey, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=427.0s)]
*  like a warm jar of honey. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=433.0s)]
*  That's a good way to describe it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=435.0s)]
*  But I don't feel like that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=437.0s)]
*  When I have to take a painkiller, I feel loopy and it feels nauseous. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=439.0s)]
*  I feel, ugh, it was gross. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=443.0s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=445.0s)]
*  Yeah, very grateful for that. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=446.0s)]
*  Why did you, you needed them after stem cells? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=447.0s)]
*  Is that what you needed them for? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=450.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I just had stem cell treatment in Mexico. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=451.0s)]
*  So you went to the CPI, the Cellular Performance Institute in Mexico, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=454.0s)]
*  and you just got hammered with them, right? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=458.0s)]
*  Yeah. I was there for a week. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=460.0s)]
*  And it was intense. It was great. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=462.0s)]
*  So yeah, so my treatment was pretty over the top. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=464.0s)]
*  Not over the top, but for me it was a lot. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=468.0s)]
*  I got both shoulders done, both knees, my right elbow, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=470.0s)]
*  my lumbar spine, and my cervical spine. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=475.0s)]
*  And they, you know, I did the cervical spine and the lumbar. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=478.0s)]
*  And when they do your spine, they put you out. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=482.0s)]
*  So they put you under anesthesia. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=484.0s)]
*  And then they do the rest of my body at that same time. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=486.0s)]
*  And then because there were so many stem cells in my back, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=488.0s)]
*  like most of the time people wake up from that [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=492.0s)]
*  and they're really sore and a lot of pain. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=494.0s)]
*  And so they gave me some pain medication, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=497.0s)]
*  which I sort of needed right when I woke up. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=500.0s)]
*  But like by the next morning I was just on like the Tylenol trip. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=502.0s)]
*  So like things mellowed out really quick for me. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=506.0s)]
*  So that was two weeks ago, you said? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=508.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was like 10 days ago now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=510.0s)]
*  10 days ago. Yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=511.0s)]
*  Do you feel any difference? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=512.0s)]
*  Yes. So I'm not supposed to feel any different for like the first month. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=514.0s)]
*  Like, you know, these sort of stem cells are a little bit different. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=521.0s)]
*  That's my understanding at least. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=525.0s)]
*  So they're called a hypoxic stem cell and they're from cord blood. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=527.0s)]
*  So they're from an umbilical cord. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=532.0s)]
*  And I got 180 million stem cells injected. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=535.0s)]
*  And then I got 100 million stem cells in an IV. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=542.0s)]
*  And so those kind of stem cells, they're called hypoxic, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=546.0s)]
*  which is I think it means that they do really, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=551.0s)]
*  really well under very low oxygen environments. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=553.0s)]
*  So they're able to live on my body for up to 12 months. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=556.0s)]
*  Live, I don't know if that's the right word, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=559.0s)]
*  but they stay active and growing in your body for 12 months. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=561.0s)]
*  So now it's just a matter of me following the protocol, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=564.0s)]
*  which is not that fun. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=567.0s)]
*  And so the protocol involves essentially a lot of rest, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=569.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to train. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=573.0s)]
*  Like what is the protocol? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=574.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=576.0s)]
*  So the protocol with these specific stem cells, like, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=577.0s)]
*  because they sort of live so long in your body, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=580.0s)]
*  the first two weeks is basically nothing. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=583.0s)]
*  It's like maybe 15 minutes of like walking per day. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=586.0s)]
*  And then after that, you work with a physical therapist [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=589.0s)]
*  and you have very specific physical therapy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=592.0s)]
*  So it's like a lot of like stabilization stuff. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=594.0s)]
*  Like I did my spine. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=596.0s)]
*  So I was talking to Nick, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=597.0s)]
*  who's my physical therapist. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=599.0s)]
*  And so she's creating like a physical therapy schedule [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=600.0s)]
*  and program for me based around my spine. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=604.0s)]
*  And she told me that she's, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=607.0s)]
*  she's worked with some people who have had intense stem cell [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=609.0s)]
*  therapies and it's like a pretty crazy opportunity to, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=613.0s)]
*  to kind of, you have like a second chance, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=617.0s)]
*  like at this age with my spine to like really change it the way, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=621.0s)]
*  the way it is. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=624.0s)]
*  And so I'm like, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=625.0s)]
*  I'm pretty excited about that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=626.0s)]
*  I have some like degeneration and some, some, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=627.0s)]
*  some bulging discs in my lower, lower back. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=630.0s)]
*  And then I have some, my upper, upper back, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=632.0s)]
*  my cervical spine is pretty fucked up from all the surfing [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=635.0s)]
*  wipeouts I've had. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=637.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=638.0s)]
*  So surfing wipeouts, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=639.0s)]
*  like when you hit the ground and the water comes, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=640.0s)]
*  like falling off a 60 foot wave and hitting the surface of the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=642.0s)]
*  water, that impact with the water, like moving at, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=646.0s)]
*  like 30 miles an hour and you go in the other direction, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=649.0s)]
*  that kind of thing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=651.0s)]
*  And then you're like, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=652.0s)]
*  I'm moving at, you know, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=653.0s)]
*  like 30 miles an hour and you go in the other direction, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=654.0s)]
*  that yeah. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=657.0s)]
*  So my neck is jacked up from a lot of that. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=658.0s)]
*  And do they go right into the actual disc itself? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=661.0s)]
*  So they go in, I know in my, I don't want to mess this up, right. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=665.0s)]
*  But I try to ask all the right questions and memorize everything. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=668.0s)]
*  But I know in my cervical spine, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=671.0s)]
*  they mostly did my facets, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=674.0s)]
*  but in my lower back, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=676.0s)]
*  I think they went straight in the discs. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=678.0s)]
*  So they did my SI joint and then like my C5, C4, that's, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=680.0s)]
*  I don't know if that sounds correct, but. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=683.0s)]
*  So yeah, they did the discs. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=685.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=687.0s)]
*  So is it supposed to make the disc expand? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=688.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=690.0s)]
*  And make it larger. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=691.0s)]
*  And so there's more cushion between the spinal column. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=692.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=695.0s)]
*  And they re, you know, like they regrow tissue, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=697.0s)]
*  they regrow ligaments. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=700.0s)]
*  And so where there's been a lot of wearing down, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=701.0s)]
*  a lot of times it'll regrow that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=705.0s)]
*  So I did my MRIs before my treatment and then I'll go back six [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=706.0s)]
*  months from now and get updated MRIs. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=709.0s)]
*  They're really good about the data, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=711.0s)]
*  so they want to see your progress. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=713.0s)]
*  So the doctor will go over you with your new MRI six months from now [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=714.0s)]
*  and compare them exactly to the previous MRI and go, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=717.0s)]
*  hey, here's where, here's where your knee was. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=721.0s)]
*  Or here's where your discs were. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=724.0s)]
*  And here's where they are now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=726.0s)]
*  And so they tried, you know, that's the, that's the goal, right, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=728.0s)]
*  is for you to see some major improvement. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=732.0s)]
*  And is a part of the thing with not exercising at all, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=734.0s)]
*  just make sure that you don't, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=738.0s)]
*  don't do any breaking down of the body while it's going through this [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=739.0s)]
*  process of accepting the stem cells. Is that? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=744.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. So the, my, my understanding is, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=746.0s)]
*  so in your body, like the way an injury or like a torn ligament or a torn [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=750.0s)]
*  rotator cuff shows up in your body, it's just inflammation. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=756.0s)]
*  And inflammation is like basically like a magnet for stem cells. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=760.0s)]
*  So the, so the stem cells go exactly where they're needed in your body. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=766.0s)]
*  They're really smart. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=769.0s)]
*  So the, so the stem cells were injected straight into the joints and into the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=770.0s)]
*  areas of my body. But what'd you ask me again? What was the question? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=775.0s)]
*  I said the idea of no exercise. Is it just like, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=780.0s)]
*  you just have no nothing, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=784.0s)]
*  no strain on the body whatsoever for a long time while these stem cells sort [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=787.0s)]
*  of just start doing their work. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=792.0s)]
*  So what you don't want to do is create inflammation that wasn't there already [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=794.0s)]
*  because you want your stem cells to go to your inflammation that you already had [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=798.0s)]
*  before. Right. Right. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=801.0s)]
*  So you want it to heal your body where you need it the most. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=802.0s)]
*  So you don't want it. Like if I went like running 15 miles right now, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=805.0s)]
*  my stem cells get confused and trying to go to my calves to try to, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=808.0s)]
*  try to repair that, that muscle soreness because that's inflammation. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=812.0s)]
*  Right. And so you don't want to do that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=816.0s)]
*  And you don't want to decrease inflammation either when you get stem cells, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=818.0s)]
*  which is interesting. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=821.0s)]
*  So I can't do the cold plunge. I can't do the, I can't do the sauna. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=822.0s)]
*  Can't take anti-inflammatories. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=826.0s)]
*  How long do they tell you not to do the cold plunge or sauna? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=828.0s)]
*  Like five or six weeks. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=831.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=832.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=833.0s)]
*  Cause these, these stem cells are so active for so long that if you really want [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=834.0s)]
*  to get the most out of the treatment, that that's the protocol. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=838.0s)]
*  And I was like, ah, they're just saying that, you know, they're just, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=841.0s)]
*  they're just saying that for like the, the like general public. But [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=844.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=847.0s)]
*  I think athletes always feel like they're like in a different category. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=848.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=851.0s)]
*  And just because I don't know why that is. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=852.0s)]
*  Cause you are in a different category. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=854.0s)]
*  Well, in some aspects maybe, but, and then, and then I call my physical therapist. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=855.0s)]
*  I'm like, Hey, these guys are saying this, but like, obviously it's not that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=859.0s)]
*  Right. And then she's like, no, they're there. That's right on. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=863.0s)]
*  Like if you want to get the most out of this treatment, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=866.0s)]
*  then you got to follow the protocol and that that is the protocol. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=868.0s)]
*  So that would drive me nuts. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=871.0s)]
*  I am being a big baby about the not working out part. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=872.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=875.0s)]
*  Can you do anything? Can you swim? Can you do anything? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=876.0s)]
*  I can swim. They, they encourage you to swim. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=878.0s)]
*  You can walk a lot and like, unless obviously, unless you have pain. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=881.0s)]
*  So in your knees or something, you get pain. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=885.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=886.0s)]
*  Because the stem cells are like really active in your body. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=887.0s)]
*  So like if you get knee pain, it could like, it could flare up because of the stem cells. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=889.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=892.0s)]
*  If you're not having that, then you can walk a lot. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=893.0s)]
*  And then I'll be able to do like resistance training with bands and stuff, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=895.0s)]
*  like fairly soon, like probably like four weeks from now. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=899.0s)]
*  And then, but it's difficult, you know, like at my, at my age, I'm 51 and, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=902.0s)]
*  and for like 18 months, I've been pretty on it, like trying to be fit, trying to get my fitness better, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=906.0s)]
*  trying, you know, really trying to get in shape. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=912.0s)]
*  You look like a rip, dude. You sent me a picture. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=914.0s)]
*  You're looking good. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=916.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's funny how guys will do that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=918.0s)]
*  Other guys would be like, Hey, update right here. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=920.0s)]
*  Especially when you're, when you work freaking hard, dude. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=924.0s)]
*  Yeah. You want people to see it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=926.0s)]
*  It takes a long time, especially me. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=927.0s)]
*  I'm like a, I don't know, the, like the way my body works, like if I don't work out, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=929.0s)]
*  if I don't work out, like, so right now, if I didn't work out for like three months, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=934.0s)]
*  I'll lose so much. Right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=938.0s)]
*  Like just be like, I feel like I'm going to turn to mush. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=939.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=942.0s)]
*  Once I mush, it might take a year to get back. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=944.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=947.0s)]
*  That what I lost in like, you know, one month or six weeks or something. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=948.0s)]
*  It's just wild. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=951.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=952.0s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=953.0s)]
*  It's a bum. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=954.0s)]
*  Not cool with it at all. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=955.0s)]
*  So yeah, it's, it really makes you appreciate it though. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=956.0s)]
*  Once, once you do get it back. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=959.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=961.0s)]
*  Once if you do get out of shape and then you get back in shape, you realize how hard it is. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=962.0s)]
*  That's one. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=966.0s)]
*  One of the reasons why I'm so fanatical about working out, because I know that when I've gotten out of shape, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=967.0s)]
*  that road back is a lot different at 56, which is how old I am versus 30 or 25. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=971.0s)]
*  Yeah. The road back. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=979.0s)]
*  Road back 25 is a couple of weeks. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=980.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=981.0s)]
*  Good to go. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=983.0s)]
*  You're tippy top shape again, but at 56, it's like months. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=984.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=987.0s)]
*  The, this is cool. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=988.0s)]
*  I, one thing I did learn and I'm, and I'm, and I'm trying to keep this in mind when, when I'm sort of being a baby about all that thing, about not working out. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=990.0s)]
*  You're like, your muscles have a really strong memory. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=998.0s)]
*  So if you're really fit and then all of a sudden you go through a period like I'm going through right now where I'm probably going to get unfit for a little bit, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1002.0s)]
*  it'll come back much faster back to kind of exactly where you were before really quickly because your muscles have memory. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1009.0s)]
*  So like- [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1016.0s)]
*  Definitely in comparison to someone who's out of shape. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1018.0s)]
*  Someone who never works out at all. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1019.0s)]
*  It will take them forever to get into the shape that you were in. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1020.0s)]
*  Right. Totally. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1022.0s)]
*  Yeah. Big difference. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1023.0s)]
*  But I guess I forget exactly. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1024.0s)]
*  I think it was Andrew Huberman was talking about it and he was saying that like there's like muscle bellies within your muscle. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1026.0s)]
*  And, and so if, if you develop those muscle bellies, they have a really solid memory. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1032.0s)]
*  And so when you try to get back in shape, you'll snap back way faster. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1040.0s)]
*  So- [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1044.0s)]
*  I definitely have heard that before and it definitely makes sense, you know, that your, your body recognizes like, oh, this is a place that we've been before. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1045.0s)]
*  We have a memory of this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1053.0s)]
*  So we'll just get back to where that is. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1055.0s)]
*  And just to get someone who's one of the things that drives me crazy is that people that are really out of shape that have never worked out and they're like, I got to get in shape. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1057.0s)]
*  Like, okay. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1066.0s)]
*  Do you know what you're saying? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1067.0s)]
*  Like that, that you don't don't like I have a friend of mine is overweight and he's been talking to me about exercise and just like, I'm worried about being sore. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1068.0s)]
*  I go, listen, man, if you want to do this, I go, if you want to do this, I go, I will work out with you and I promise you, you will barely get sore because I am not going to make you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1079.0s)]
*  We will work out for maybe 20 minutes. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1089.0s)]
*  And he goes, why just 20 minutes? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1092.0s)]
*  I go, because you're not doing anything right now. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1093.0s)]
*  Like you shouldn't. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1095.0s)]
*  If you try to do what I do every day, your body's going to tear apart. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1096.0s)]
*  Like you blow your shoulders out. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1101.0s)]
*  You've ruined your knees. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1103.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1104.0s)]
*  What we want to do is just slowly build you up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1105.0s)]
*  What I'll have you do is just do like five pushups, five body weight squats, five sit ups, take a break, relax. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1107.0s)]
*  I'll show you some stuff that we can do with bands. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1115.0s)]
*  I'll give you some different exercises that we could do with kettlebells. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1119.0s)]
*  Very light, just clean press. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1123.0s)]
*  I'll just have a couple of things that you do, some swings and we'll work out for maybe 20 minutes and then stop. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1126.0s)]
*  And then I want to see how you feel the next day. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1133.0s)]
*  And then I'm going to get you in the cold plunge. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1135.0s)]
*  I'm going to get you in the sauna. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1137.0s)]
*  And then in two days, we'll do it again. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1139.0s)]
*  And if we do it again, it's still the same thing. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1142.0s)]
*  Very light, 20 minutes. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1144.0s)]
*  And I would do that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1146.0s)]
*  And I told them I will do that with you for a couple of weeks before I have you really straining hard. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1148.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1153.0s)]
*  I don't want you like hurting yourself because too many people, they try to make up for years of abuse and they try to just jump right back in and fucking run a marathon. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1154.0s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1164.0s)]
*  You need to your body is out of shape. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1166.0s)]
*  Like it's got it's got you have no muscle tissue. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1169.0s)]
*  You're surrounded by fat. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1172.0s)]
*  Like we got to build it back nice and slow the same way it got sick. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1174.0s)]
*  Build it back. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1178.0s)]
*  So many people take 20 years to put on 100 pounds and then expect to lose it in three months. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1180.0s)]
*  You know, one. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1186.0s)]
*  And that's the big hook with all these stupid diet programs. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1187.0s)]
*  Ten weeks to six pack abs. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1190.0s)]
*  Like, no, that's not going to happen. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1192.0s)]
*  No, it's not going to happen. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1195.0s)]
*  I feel like people really tend to overestimate how much you have to train to like the like the duration per day. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1196.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1203.0s)]
*  Like exactly what you said, like your friend that misconception of like, well, I need to work out an hour every single day and person's totally obese or something like that. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1204.0s)]
*  You don't need to at all. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1210.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1212.0s)]
*  And consistency is way more important than even intensity. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1213.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1216.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, if you're kind of intense, but you're super consistent, you do it every single day or five days a week, you get insane results in six months. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1217.0s)]
*  Well, that's one of the things that the Russians figured out with wrestling that instead of these like unbelievably brutal, intense workouts like the American wrestlers were doing, what they were doing was very high volume technical work. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1224.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1239.0s)]
*  Over long periods of time, like several hours per day. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1240.0s)]
*  And they were training multiple days, like almost every day a week. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1244.0s)]
*  And but not high intensity all the time. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1247.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1250.0s)]
*  And they were developing a far greater array of skills. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1251.0s)]
*  Their skill, the skill improvement was greater. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1254.0s)]
*  And then overall fitness was also getting great, too, because you weren't breaking yourself down and then forcing yourself to work out with a broken down body. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1257.0s)]
*  They were they were doing it the correct way. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1266.0s)]
*  But the correct way and the tough guy way are very different things like the tough guy ways. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1268.0s)]
*  Fuck it. Just fucking grind. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1274.0s)]
*  Get in there and push. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1276.0s)]
*  And that's that's a good mentality, sort of. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1277.0s)]
*  But you can trip yourself up with that because you literally put too much of a demand on your body than your body is capable of meeting. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1281.0s)]
*  Like your mind can be tougher than the actual physical the actual physical ability of your body to recover and move. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1297.0s)]
*  And yeah, I think it's easy to overtrain, too, when you get really sometimes you get addicted to training like I am for sure. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1298.0s)]
*  I love working out. I love it. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1304.0s)]
*  But, you know, I train so differently now than I did when I was in my 40s and my 30s. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1307.0s)]
*  I think I overtrained a lot when I was when I was younger. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1311.0s)]
*  Yeah. And now I'm realizing, at least for my goals now, like my goal with working out now is like specifically for so I can continue doing the things I love to do as long as possible. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1314.0s)]
*  I want to bow hunt. I want to snowboard. I want to surf to him in my 80s. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1327.0s)]
*  You know, that's that's the real goal. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1328.0s)]
*  Or maybe as long as I possibly can. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1330.0s)]
*  I don't I mean, I like getting super jacked or beginning super shredded or whatever. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1332.0s)]
*  That's that's that sounds like fun, too. But really, it's all about like like performance. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1343.0s)]
*  Long term performance. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1344.0s)]
*  Can you do yoga after stem cells? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1346.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1348.0s)]
*  Specifically said that. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1351.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1352.0s)]
*  But you can. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1353.0s)]
*  But not it's not at first. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1354.0s)]
*  So the first like month to eight weeks are really important for the stem cells. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1356.0s)]
*  And it really depends. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1361.0s)]
*  So like if I just had like a say like a torn rotator cuff and I did the injection on my shoulder, I could start start getting back in the gym much faster and I can start doing squats and I can start doing all this other stuff. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1362.0s)]
*  Like once they're settled into where they are is fine. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1374.0s)]
*  But you don't want to create inflammation in those areas. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1377.0s)]
*  So as long as you're not doing overhead presses on that shoulder, you're probably going to be doing me just fine. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1380.0s)]
*  So with me, I had, you know, extensive stem cells throughout my body, especially in my spine and my back. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1385.0s)]
*  So I got to be careful. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1391.0s)]
*  I'm very interested to see how the spine, the back stuff works. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1392.0s)]
*  I've had a lot of those same issues myself with degenerative discs. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1395.0s)]
*  And it's just from jujitsu mostly. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1399.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1402.0s)]
*  Everybody I know from jujitsu has something fucked up about their backs. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1403.0s)]
*  I know a lot of guys who have had disc replacements. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1406.0s)]
*  They open you up and put a fucking titanium disc in there. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1410.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1414.0s)]
*  The problem with that is like they got to replace it someday. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1416.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1419.0s)]
*  And so you want to put that off as long as you can. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1422.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1423.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1424.0s)]
*  A second spinal surgery. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1425.0s)]
*  Go back in there. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1426.0s)]
*  Such a nightmare. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1427.0s)]
*  And a lot of times they go from the front. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1428.0s)]
*  I heard they go through your neck through the front of your neck to get to their early. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1429.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1433.0s)]
*  I guess it's the best way to do it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1434.0s)]
*  They open you up. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1436.0s)]
*  They open up a slit. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1437.0s)]
*  They spread it open like a keyhole. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1438.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1440.0s)]
*  I'm going to try with the stem cells for now. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1441.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1442.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1443.0s)]
*  You're fit, dude. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1444.0s)]
*  What have you been eating? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1445.0s)]
*  I know I asked you on the... [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1446.0s)]
*  I was texting you, but I wanted to get a full breakdown of Joe's food program. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1447.0s)]
*  It's almost all meat. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1451.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1452.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1453.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1454.0s)]
*  I'm almost entirely... [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1455.0s)]
*  That's my... [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1456.0s)]
*  All I eat is meat. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1457.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1458.0s)]
*  I need to unpack this. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1459.0s)]
*  Like yesterday my entire day was almost... [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1460.0s)]
*  My entire day was like 95% elk. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1462.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1465.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1466.0s)]
*  That's all I eat. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1467.0s)]
*  That's freaking awesome. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1469.0s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1470.0s)]
*  For me, it just seems to work. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1471.0s)]
*  I mean, I've tried a bunch of different diets, but for me there's a lot of benefits to this [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1474.0s)]
*  carnivore diet. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1479.24s)]
*  And one of the biggest ones, because I do this for a living, right? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1480.24s)]
*  So one of the biggest ones is the cognitive benefits. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1483.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1486.0s)]
*  There's some giant difference between your body running on ketones, which is essentially [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1487.0s)]
*  what it runs on when you're running on just fats and protein, versus your body running [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1491.12s)]
*  on sugar and carbs and pasta and bread. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1495.72s)]
*  That stuff would make me crash and I would feel dull. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1499.76s)]
*  My mind would feel dull. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1502.58s)]
*  And when I started back on the carnivore diet, one of the first things that I noticed almost [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1504.84s)]
*  immediately is that I had an extra gear verbally. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1510.0s)]
*  I get an extra gear cognitively. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1513.8s)]
*  My mind is forming sentences better. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1516.06s)]
*  It's quicker. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1518.76s)]
*  I'm more in tune with conversations, which obviously because I do this for a living, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1522.0s)]
*  it's fucking so critical. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1527.4s)]
*  I would stay on this diet just for that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1529.2s)]
*  Just for that. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1532.72s)]
*  But then the other benefits are my energy levels are completely flat throughout the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1533.72s)]
*  day. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1539.5600000000002s)]
*  There's no crashes. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  There's no peaks and valleys. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1541.5600000000002s)]
*  And good energy? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1542.5600000000002s)]
*  Fucking great. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1543.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1544.5600000000002s)]
*  It would take a while. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1545.5600000000002s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1546.5600000000002s)]
*  A couple weeks of the diet, my workout struggled. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1547.96s)]
*  But they call that the keto flu. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1551.24s)]
*  I think people call that. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1553.0s)]
*  It's a period of time when your body is trying to adapt to what you're trying to give it, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1554.24s)]
*  right? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1559.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1560.28s)]
*  And so I do take in some fats that aren't animal fats. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1561.28s)]
*  One of the things I really like is Primal Kitchen's products. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  Primal Kitchen makes this chipotle lime mayonnaise. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1569.08s)]
*  Is that Mark Sisson? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1572.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  I love that guy. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1575.6399999999999s)]
*  He's an awesome dude. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1576.72s)]
*  And Mark makes a Primal Kitchen mayonnaise that's avocado oil, which is very good for [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1578.2s)]
*  you. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1584.16s)]
*  I think we have some of that at the house. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1585.16s)]
*  It's great stuff. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1586.16s)]
*  And so what I do is I'll cook up on the Traeger, I'll cook up a few elk roasts for the week. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1587.16s)]
*  And then I buy four or five jars of that Primal mayonnaise at a time and I'll just scoop it [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1594.44s)]
*  onto a plate and I'll just dip slices of cold elk into there. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1598.88s)]
*  I came home last night from the comedy club at 1.30 in the morning and that's what I ate. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1603.52s)]
*  I just ate a big plate of elk and some Primal Kitchen mayonnaise and watched YouTube. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1607.96s)]
*  I cannot. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1614.6399999999999s)]
*  That's discipline, dude. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1615.6399999999999s)]
*  Eat all meat all day. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1618.68s)]
*  I'm pretty decent. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1619.68s)]
*  Like, I'm pretty decent with discipline. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1620.68s)]
*  And even with my food, I'm really disciplined with working out and kind of disciplined with [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1623.76s)]
*  food. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1628.32s)]
*  And I'd say for like 80% of my food intake is like pretty darn good. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1629.32s)]
*  It's like meat and eggs for the most part. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1633.36s)]
*  But man, I do love like I have sugar cravings. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1636.52s)]
*  There's nothing about it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1639.9599999999998s)]
*  Of course. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1640.9599999999998s)]
*  Everybody does. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1641.9599999999998s)]
*  And the thing is if you don't stop eating sugar, you're always going to have these super [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1642.9599999999998s)]
*  strong sugar cravings. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1645.1999999999998s)]
*  And there's such a big difference between hunger and cravings are two totally different [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1646.1999999999998s)]
*  things but you feel them in the same way. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1653.28s)]
*  You get this trigger of like, fuck, I'm hungry. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1655.6s)]
*  Hungry right now. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1658.56s)]
*  I always said that like if you just give me a ribeye steak and I eat the ribeye steak, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1659.8s)]
*  I will be satisfied and I'll be done eating. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1663.8s)]
*  I might not even eat the whole steak. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1665.64s)]
*  You'll stop when you're done. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1667.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1668.12s)]
*  For sure. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1669.12s)]
*  But if there's a bowl of pasta right next to that, I'm going to dig into that spaghetti. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1670.12s)]
*  I'm going to fucking eat that whole thing. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1673.12s)]
*  And then I'm going to be like, oh. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1675.04s)]
*  And then my stomach's going to be bloated. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1676.52s)]
*  And I'm like, oh. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1678.32s)]
*  Like I've had giant meals and then just looked at my stomach in the mirror. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1679.32s)]
*  I'm like, what are you pregnant? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1682.8799999999999s)]
*  Like what is that? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1684.4s)]
*  It just bloated with food. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1685.4s)]
*  I'm a real glutton. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1688.08s)]
*  I have a real problem with food. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1689.72s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1691.36s)]
*  But I don't really because I'm disciplined. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1692.76s)]
*  But if I let myself, I will eat two pizzas. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1695.6399999999999s)]
*  I will fucking, you give me like two pepperoni and mushroom pizzas, I will fucking keep eating [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1698.84s)]
*  until I'm like stuffing it. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1703.36s)]
*  Like the pizza's up to my neck like. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1706.8s)]
*  It's really hard to do that with meat. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1709.48s)]
*  It's really hard to do that when you're eating just meat. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1710.92s)]
*  We're going to eat until you're done and then you're done. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1712.72s)]
*  Meat has a very high satiety level. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1714.88s)]
*  And anything that's high in protein, it satisfies you very quickly. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1718.16s)]
*  It's delicious. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1722.0400000000002s)]
*  It's so satisfying. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1723.0400000000002s)]
*  It's 100% my favorite thing to eat. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1724.0400000000002s)]
*  So if I could just eat ribeye steaks or elk meat for the rest of my life. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  The thing about eating game, wild game though, is you must supplement with fat. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1728.44s)]
*  You have to have fat. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1733.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1734.3600000000001s)]
*  You lose too much weight too. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1735.3600000000001s)]
*  Well you're not getting enough fat. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1737.3200000000002s)]
*  You have to get fat. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1739.2s)]
*  Fat is important for your brain function. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1740.2s)]
*  It's important for everything. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1742.88s)]
*  So that's why I like that primal kitchen mayonnaise stuff. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1744.56s)]
*  Or when I cook elk, what I'll do is most of the time I will slow cook it on the Traeger [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1749.36s)]
*  like 265 until it reaches an internal temperature about like 115 or so. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1756.44s)]
*  And then what I do is I take cast iron frying pan and I use beef tallow. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1762.48s)]
*  And so you get a lot of fat from the beef tallow. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1766.12s)]
*  So I'll use grass fed beef tallow and I sear it on the outside in that beef tallow. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1770.2s)]
*  I get the fat from that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1775.1599999999999s)]
*  I also try to get fat from bacon. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1776.3999999999999s)]
*  Your bacon's not good for you. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1778.2s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1780.36s)]
*  Listen, trust me, it's good for you. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1781.36s)]
*  It's fat. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1782.9199999999998s)]
*  You need fat. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1783.9199999999998s)]
*  Like animal fat. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1784.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not good for you if you're eating all cheeseburgers from McDonald's and processed [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1785.9199999999998s)]
*  food. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1788.6s)]
*  And then you put bacon on top of that. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1789.6s)]
*  But if you're eating clean, bacon's fine. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1790.6s)]
*  The bacon's not the problem. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1791.6s)]
*  The real problem is there's a giant issue that people have with processed foods. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1793.16s)]
*  And when you talk about like there's a bunch of goofy epidemiology studies that talk about [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1801.3200000000002s)]
*  how meat increases your rate of cancer. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1808.0400000000002s)]
*  But the way those studies work is someone will fill out a form like how many days a [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1811.16s)]
*  week do you eat meat? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1817.0400000000002s)]
*  And I eat meat six days a week. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1818.8400000000001s)]
*  What they don't ask is what kind of meat? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1821.04s)]
*  Are you eating a Jack in the Box cheeseburger? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1823.1599999999999s)]
*  Do you have fries with that? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1825.36s)]
*  Do you have a shake? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1826.36s)]
*  Do you have soda? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1827.36s)]
*  There's a bunch of other things that people do eat. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1829.0s)]
*  So there's a thing called healthy user bias. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1831.12s)]
*  So if you're someone who says like I don't eat any meat, well you're probably listening [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1833.36s)]
*  to a lot. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1839.1599999999999s)]
*  You're probably trying to do the right thing for your health. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1840.32s)]
*  So you're listening to what would be like mainstream conventional doctor's wisdom on [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1843.9s)]
*  diet, which is almost certainly off. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1850.5800000000002s)]
*  Because most of these doctors that are talking about this, they're not up on the latest studies. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1853.7s)]
*  They're not like Huberman or Lane Norton or anything. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1858.42s)]
*  If you really want to know what's good for you and what's bad for you, I always say listen [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1863.02s)]
*  to jacked scientists. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1867.3000000000002s)]
*  Like those are the guys that are going to tell you. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1869.5400000000002s)]
*  These are the foods that are actually good for you. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1871.3000000000002s)]
*  And almost everyone agrees. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1873.7s)]
*  Sugar is terrible for you. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1875.86s)]
*  Sugar, breads, pastas, and then you get into the more controversial areas of seed oils. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1877.3s)]
*  Seed oils which essentially were initially invented to be industrial lubricants for machinery. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1883.9199999999998s)]
*  And they figured out, have you ever seen the process where they take canola oil, which [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1892.26s)]
*  you think of as like oh canola, must be corn, must be healthy. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  It's rapeseed, which is that word people don't like. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1901.1799999999998s)]
*  Like rapeseed? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1904.6999999999998s)]
*  What the fuck is that thing? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to have nothing to do with that plant. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1907.1599999999999s)]
*  Well that's what canola oil is. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1909.8999999999999s)]
*  And then there's like safflower oil and sunflower oil. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1912.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh those sound wonderful. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1916.4599999999998s)]
*  Not good for you at all. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1918.0s)]
*  Avocado oil is though. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1919.0s)]
*  Avocado oil is very good for you. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1921.0s)]
*  Olive oil, very good for you. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1923.1s)]
*  There's a lot of oils that are very good for you. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1924.1s)]
*  That's another thing though. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1925.9799999999998s)]
*  Those two in particular are definitely the best. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1926.9799999999998s)]
*  There's another thing I really like to do with meat. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1928.34s)]
*  Pour olive oil on it. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1930.78s)]
*  Put a little salt, put a little olive oil. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1931.78s)]
*  That's the way I'm getting a lot of healthy fats. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1934.42s)]
*  And so with my diet I have to make sure that I get healthy fats because you just eat just [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1936.3s)]
*  only like elk. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1941.9s)]
*  There's not enough fat. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1942.9s)]
*  They're too lean. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1943.9s)]
*  But rib eyes, you could eat all rib eyes all day. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1944.9s)]
*  If I ate all elk I would probably weigh 130 pounds. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1947.9s)]
*  You'd get shredded though son. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1951.54s)]
*  Shredded like crazy. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1952.54s)]
*  Shredded. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1953.54s)]
*  For sure. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1954.54s)]
*  What I was saying was for the first two weeks it was really hard. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1957.1s)]
*  My workouts were rough. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1960.18s)]
*  It was like I was sort of fighting off a cold almost. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1962.3799999999999s)]
*  I was just like ugh. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1965.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1966.3799999999999s)]
*  Low energy. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1967.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1968.3799999999999s)]
*  Headaches too? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1969.3799999999999s)]
*  No, not that bad. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1970.3799999999999s)]
*  No just a little bit of fatigue. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1972.3799999999999s)]
*  And mostly just during exercise. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1974.22s)]
*  It wasn't really that much during the day. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1975.58s)]
*  Not at all during the day in fact. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1978.7s)]
*  But I could feel the difference. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1980.34s)]
*  But somewhere along the line about two weeks in your body hits a switch and now it has [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1982.24s)]
*  no effect on me. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1987.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1988.04s)]
*  Now I feel great. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1989.04s)]
*  I feel great hitting the bag. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1990.04s)]
*  I feel great doing sprints. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1991.04s)]
*  Sprints on the air dyne bike. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1992.92s)]
*  I feel great with my body weight workouts, kettlebell workouts. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1994.0s)]
*  Everything's great. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1996.72s)]
*  But more importantly for my job, for this, my brain works better. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=1997.84s)]
*  Just works better. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2002.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2003.96s)]
*  And for comedy writing. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2004.96s)]
*  Much better. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2005.96s)]
*  All the above. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2006.96s)]
*  Everything's better. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2007.96s)]
*  It's just carbs and bread and all that stuff. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2008.96s)]
*  I love just the crash. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2011.24s)]
*  The inconsistency that you get throughout the day. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2012.84s)]
*  And also the fact that you just keep eating. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2015.24s)]
*  You just get bloated. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2018.48s)]
*  You just stuff your fat fucking face with cheeseburgers. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2020.52s)]
*  If you give me cheeseburgers with buns, I'll eat three or four of those. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2024.04s)]
*  I can't stop. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2027.64s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2028.64s)]
*  You'll eat it till it's all gone. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2029.64s)]
*  I will too. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2030.96s)]
*  But you know what I like to go to In-N-Out and I get those Flying Dutchmen? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2031.96s)]
*  You ever get that? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2035.92s)]
*  No. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2036.92s)]
*  I don't really like In-N-Out. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2037.92s)]
*  You don't like them? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2038.92s)]
*  I don't like In-N-Out. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2039.92s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2041.0s)]
*  Their fries suck. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2042.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2043.0s)]
*  I feel like I judge a burger joint on the fries. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2044.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2047.0s)]
*  I love their fries. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2048.0s)]
*  I don't like their fries. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2049.0s)]
*  Do you like McDonald's fries? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2050.0s)]
*  No. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2051.0s)]
*  No? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2052.0s)]
*  Whose fries do you like? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2053.0s)]

*  You know who has the best fries? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2057.08s)]
*  Sweet potato fries. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2058.08s)]
*  I'm a big fan of them. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2059.08s)]
*  Oh those are the best. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2060.08s)]
*  But you know who has the best fries in all of the fast food burgers? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2061.08s)]
*  Five Guys. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2063.84s)]
*  Five Guys. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2064.84s)]
*  Five Guys has some fucking fries. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2065.84s)]
*  I don't think I've ever eaten at Five Guys. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2066.84s)]
*  Oh they're the best. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2068.84s)]
*  Five Guys will give you bacon on your burger and jalapenos. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2070.88s)]
*  You get bacon and jalapenos. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2073.2400000000002s)]
*  Five Guys is the best. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2075.28s)]
*  I prefer Five Guys over even over In-N-Out. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2076.28s)]
*  My son likes In-N-Out and we go there sometimes and I get the animal style with the lettuce [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2079.7200000000003s)]
*  wraps and it's alright. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2083.76s)]
*  Lettuce wraps okay. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2086.04s)]
*  I prefer what's called a Flying Dutchman. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2087.04s)]
*  What a Flying Dutchman is just a patty, slice of cheese, patty. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2089.04s)]
*  That's what I get. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2094.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh gotcha. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2095.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like a patty sandwich. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2096.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like a cheese sandwich with the patties as the bread. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2097.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you eat cheese on a regular? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2099.6s)]

*  What about fruit? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2106.08s)]
*  No fruit? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2107.08s)]
*  Occasionally I have fruit. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2108.08s)]
*  Does it make you feel weird or anything? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2109.08s)]
*  No. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2111.8399999999997s)]
*  Do they give you a weird insulin spike? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2112.8399999999997s)]
*  Sometimes in the morning I just decide I want a little pep up. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2113.8399999999997s)]
*  I'll have a banana before I work out. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2116.2799999999997s)]
*  But most of the time I work out fasted. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2118.08s)]
*  I like berries and papayas. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2120.3199999999997s)]
*  I eat a lot of them. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2121.3199999999997s)]

*  Papayas. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2127.3199999999997s)]
*  Papayas are really good for your digestion. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2128.4s)]
*  I was going to say that while we're on this thing about the food, Denise from Wastewell, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2130.96s)]
*  I did my original blood work with her and then we did a really cool Zoom call afterwards [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2141.32s)]
*  and we talked for like an hour about my blood work and I was deficient in a bunch of different [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2147.32s)]
*  things. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2152.7200000000003s)]
*  And one of the things was vitamin D. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2153.7200000000003s)]
*  And she goes, I think you should start supplementing with vitamin D. Do you? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2156.68s)]
*  And I said, yeah, I actually take vitamin D every day. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2159.68s)]
*  And she's like, well, there's some weird disconnect so will you send me the brand or whatever [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  you take? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2166.72s)]
*  She's like, that's a great brand. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2167.72s)]
*  There's something wrong happening with the way your body's trying to absorb and digest [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2168.72s)]
*  that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2173.36s)]
*  So she has, so there was a bunch of things in my diet that I was taking that I was kind [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2174.36s)]
*  of deficient in. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2178.2s)]
*  And so she started me on this digestive enzyme, which is essentially papaya enzymes. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2179.8399999999997s)]
*  And then I got my blood work done six months later and I was like really great on my vitamin [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2187.8799999999997s)]
*  D. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2191.2799999999997s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2192.2799999999997s)]
*  So there was something about your diet and the supplements where your body wasn't accepting [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2193.2799999999997s)]
*  the vitamin D? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2199.8399999999997s)]
*  They usually say vitamin D you should take with K2. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2200.8399999999997s)]
*  Are you taking it with K2? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2202.7999999999997s)]
*  I take both. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2204.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2205.3599999999997s)]
*  But my body for some reason just wasn't getting the vitamin D. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2206.3599999999997s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2208.08s)]
*  There's a lot of people that are deficient in vitamin D. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2209.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2211.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a giant problem. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2212.0s)]
*  And it's a giant problem. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2213.0s)]
*  Well, it's really a hormone. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2215.0s)]
*  Vitamin D is very different. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2216.0s)]
*  And the best way to get it really is from outside. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2217.0s)]
*  The best way to get it is from the sun. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2219.12s)]
*  But if you don't get it from the sun enough, like specifically if you live in a cold climate, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2221.72s)]
*  you really have to supplement. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2225.64s)]
*  If you don't, it's just really bad for your health overall in all ways. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2227.0s)]
*  Your immune system function, something like at one point in time, like 74% of the people [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2231.56s)]
*  that were in the ICU for COVID were deficient in vitamin D. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2236.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2239.7999999999997s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2240.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2241.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think that most people just in general are deficient in vitamin D. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2242.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2246.2s)]
*  And it's surprisingly most surfers are deficient in vitamin D. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2247.2s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2251.44s)]
*  And they're outside in the ocean. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2252.44s)]
*  Yes, very weird. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2253.44s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2254.44s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense, but it's true. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2255.44s)]
*  What could be causing that? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2256.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2257.7599999999998s)]
*  Like what about surfing? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2258.7599999999998s)]
*  I have no idea, but that's the actual thing. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2259.7599999999998s)]
*  Is it possible that somehow or another there's something about the water? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2263.52s)]
*  I surf, I'm in the sun every single day. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2266.2s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2267.96s)]
*  I'm deficient in vitamin D. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2268.96s)]
*  And you tan. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2269.96s)]
*  And I was really deficient in vitamin D. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2270.96s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2271.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty weird. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2272.96s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2273.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2274.96s)]
*  God, I wonder what that would be. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2275.96s)]
*  That doesn't even make sense. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2276.96s)]
*  I know, very strange. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2279.44s)]
*  I would think if anybody would have like super high levels of vitamin D, it'd be surfers. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2280.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2285.28s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2286.28s)]
*  Shirt off, shorts on, barefoot. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2287.28s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know where it is. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2288.28s)]
*  Your whole body is like a big old fucking solar panel for vitamin D. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2289.28s)]
*  I don't know, but I definitely wasn't getting it. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2293.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2295.4s)]
*  I have to supplement that. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2296.4s)]
*  I have to supplement a couple different things. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2297.4s)]
*  One of the things that I do that Huberman says to do is I spend the early part of the [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2299.4s)]
*  morning like staring into the sun. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2304.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2306.32s)]
*  I get up in the morning and the first thing I do is go into the cold plunge. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2307.32s)]
*  And where my cold plunge is set up, like when I get in in the morning, the sun is like right [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2310.4s)]
*  there in the sky when I'm freezing my dick off. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2315.36s)]
*  So I just lie in this thing and like stare at the sun. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2319.36s)]
*  It's an amazing way to wake up. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2322.3599999999997s)]
*  It just fires me up like right away. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2324.12s)]
*  It just changes my whole day. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2326.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2328.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, like whatever sluggishness and weirdness that I have, I get in that thing and it's like, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2329.3599999999997s)]
*  yikes. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2334.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm staring at the sun. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2335.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like, whoop. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2336.3599999999997s)]
*  All my levels just go right back up to normal. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2337.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm drawing a blank on the term, but what is it called when your body sets its time for [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2340.6s)]
*  the day from the sun? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2345.68s)]
*  Circadian rhythm? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2346.68s)]
*  Yeah, circadian rhythm. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2347.68s)]
*  Supposed to be great for that. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2348.68s)]
*  It benefits your sleep a lot, right? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2350.2s)]
*  To get sunlight early in the morning. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2351.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, supposedly. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2353.44s)]
*  Because it sets your body's clock, your mind's clock. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2354.44s)]
*  I've never had a problem with sleep. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2356.24s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2357.52s)]
*  Luckily. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2358.52s)]
*  I'm just one of those guys. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2359.52s)]
*  That would suck. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2360.52s)]
*  Yeah, I have friends that really struggle with sleep. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2361.52s)]
*  My wife struggles with sleep. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  I can go to sleep on a fucking train station floor. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I don't get it at all. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2367.6s)]
*  And I'm not super empathetic about it too, because sometimes like my wife will be up [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2369.2s)]
*  like doing something in the middle of the night and she's like, she can't sleep. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2373.64s)]
*  And I'm like, what are you doing? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2376.6s)]
*  Like go back to sleep. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2378.12s)]
*  And she's like, don't you think I want to? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2380.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, some people just can't sleep. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2381.6s)]
*  Well, Jaco only sleeps like four hours a night. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2383.6s)]
*  Dude, that's not good for you. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2386.4s)]
*  He says he doesn't need anymore. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2387.84s)]
*  Yeah, but his brain does. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2389.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2392.16s)]
*  Maybe not like for functioning right now, but like long term. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2394.2400000000002s)]
*  Like you asked Andrew Huberman, and that's one of the things you can do to like help [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2396.8s)]
*  your brain function as long as possible. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2400.16s)]
*  And like with Alzheimer's and all kinds of brain issues like long term, sleep is a major [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2401.96s)]
*  factor. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2406.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a major factor if they look at the correlation between like the amount of hours of sleep [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2407.72s)]
*  and the instances of Alzheimer's. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2412.04s)]
*  It seems to be some sort of reaction. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2413.3999999999996s)]
*  Huge. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2415.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2416.16s)]
*  Jaco is a different kind of animal though. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2417.16s)]
*  Maybe he's definitely seems built different. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2419.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he just doesn't need it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2421.7599999999998s)]
*  I think there's certain people. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2423.16s)]
*  I think Arnold is one of those people too. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2424.4399999999996s)]
*  Schwarzenegger. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2426.3999999999996s)]
*  I think he said he only sleeps a few hours a night. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2427.3999999999996s)]
*  I think there's certain people that just like they have just different requirements. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2429.9199999999996s)]
*  There are people that like physically don't need as much sleep. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2433.68s)]
*  Like everybody needs some sleep, but I think there are people, I'm not one of them. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2438.08s)]
*  I can notice the difference between six and eight hours. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2443.24s)]
*  I know it's a big difference. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2445.16s)]
*  Six hours is like, I got to push. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2447.14s)]
*  There's an extra push. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2449.3199999999997s)]
*  Whereas eight hours, good to go. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2450.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2452.3199999999997s)]
*  I sleep six or seven hours a night, but I feel like everybody's different. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2453.3199999999997s)]
*  Like there must be outliers to only sleep four hours a night and function well. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  It must not affect your hormones as much as most people. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2461.4s)]
*  Because I feel like most people, if you sleep four hours a night, it's terrible for your [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2464.04s)]
*  hormones. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2468.92s)]
*  It really depends. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2469.92s)]
*  It causes a crazy crash in your hormones. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2470.92s)]
*  I think it really depends on what you're doing. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2472.12s)]
*  For some people, if you're only sleeping four hours, but your job is very engaging and very [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2474.88s)]
*  intense and there's a lot of adrenaline, you're fired up. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2481.48s)]
*  At the end of that day, you're probably going to crash hard, but you might be able to pull [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2485.4s)]
*  it off and keep going. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2489.48s)]
*  But if you have some fucking paperwork job and you only slept four hours, you're going [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2490.68s)]
*  to be yawning and falling asleep. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2494.9199999999996s)]
*  You're going to be barely able to get through it. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2496.72s)]
*  Or even this job, there's the brain function aspect. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2498.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2501.56s)]
*  Huge. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2502.8799999999997s)]
*  After 10 years search, scientists find second short sleep gene. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2503.8799999999997s)]
*  After a decade of searching, UC San Francisco scientists who identified the only human gene [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2507.8799999999997s)]
*  known to produce natural short sleep, lifelong nightly sleep that lasts just four to six [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2512.48s)]
*  hours, yet leaves individuals feeling fully rested have discovered a second. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2518.64s)]
*  It says before we identified the first short sleep sleep gene, people really, excuse me, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2524.04s)]
*  really weren't thinking about sleep duration in genetic terms, said Ying Hu Fu, PhD, professor [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2529.72s)]
*  of neurology and member of the UCSF, Whale, how do you say that? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2536.2799999999997s)]
*  Wheel? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2542.48s)]
*  Wheel? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2543.48s)]
*  Wheel Institute for Neurosciences. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2544.48s)]
*  Fu led the research teams that discovered both short sleep genes, the newest of which [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2546.32s)]
*  is described in a paper published August 28, 2019, the Journal of Neuron. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2551.56s)]
*  According to Fu, many scientists once thought that certain sleep behaviors couldn't be [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2556.04s)]
*  studied genetically. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2560.52s)]
*  Sleep can be difficult to study using the tools of human genetics because people use [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2562.2400000000002s)]
*  alarms, coffee, and pills to alter their natural sleep cycles, she said. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2565.7200000000003s)]
*  These sleep disruptions, the thinking went, made it difficult for researchers to distinguish [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2570.6400000000003s)]
*  between people who naturally sleep for less than six hours and those who do so only with [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2574.68s)]
*  the aid of an artificial stimulant. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2579.68s)]
*  And natural short sleepers remained a mystery until 2009 when a study conducted by Fu's [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2582.12s)]
*  team discovered that people who had inherited a particular mutation in a gene called DEC2 [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2588.3199999999997s)]
*  averaged only 6.25 hours of sleep per night. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2595.56s)]
*  Study participants lacking the mutation averaged 8.06 hours. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2598.52s)]
*  The finding provided the first conclusive evidence that natural short sleep is, at least [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2603.4s)]
*  in some cases, genetic. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2608.76s)]
*  But this mutation is rare, so while it helped explain some natural short sleepers, it couldn't [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2610.4s)]
*  account for all of them. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2616.04s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2618.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is interesting. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2619.0s)]
*  I think Jocko is just an animal. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2621.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, just must vary. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2622.8s)]
*  I think he likes being tired. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2624.12s)]
*  I think he likes waking up tired and then pushing through it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2625.88s)]
*  He's probably so used to suffering on a daily that that just becomes his baseline. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2630.0s)]
*  If he's not suffering, he probably doesn't feel right. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2634.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2637.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2638.4s)]
*  Well, how many fucking, go to his Instagram. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2639.4s)]
*  How many photos of his watch at 4.30 in the morning? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2641.04s)]
*  He's got the worst but best Instagram, but the worst Instagram. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2644.24s)]
*  You're just like another watch photo. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2647.16s)]
*  But you know he's getting after it. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2648.64s)]
*  I know, it's a shitty Timex watch with scratches all over it that he's probably had for a decade. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2650.2s)]
*  My go-to when I'm working out, Joe, is I'll go on Spotify and I'll search Jocko, Goggins, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2656.24s)]
*  Rogan, Jim Motivation, and they'll have these snippets from different YouTube videos of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2664.6s)]
*  your show when you have someone on and you're getting psyched or Goggins saying you're a [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  bitch if you don't work out hard or whatever it is, and then Jocko saying a bunch of stuff. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2675.56s)]
*  It's this hyper motivational stuff. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2680.56s)]
*  Then I'll listen to that as I'm working out. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2682.2s)]
*  I swear, for sure it's like maybe 30, 40% difference in my output. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2683.96s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2688.52s)]
*  I work way harder. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2689.52s)]
*  Isn't it wild what inspiration can do? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2690.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2693.52s)]
*  Like a rock movie. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2694.52s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2695.52s)]
*  I send it to people. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2696.52s)]
*  I'll be working out and so fired up, I'll send it, I'll share it and be like, hey, next [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2697.52s)]
*  workout, you got to try this. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2701.08s)]
*  It's like that good. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2702.08s)]
*  It's like pre-workout, but the whole thing. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2703.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2704.8s)]

*  sort of mental fuel. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2713.0s)]

*  Your body responds to it like a physical drug and you get fired up. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2716.4s)]

*  and my God, you got an extra gear because of the music. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2734.52s)]

*  Especially if you're doing like Tabata sprints on the air dyne bike, a good song comes on [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2741.08s)]
*  and you're like, fuck yeah. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2744.7599999999998s)]

*  I went on this last trip, I killed four deer and that was just lots of fun. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2820.08s)]
*  I just spent tons of time mostly spooking deer and missing, but four. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2825.32s)]
*  You went to Maui? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2829.96s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2830.96s)]
*  The thing about access deer hunting is it's so sustainable. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2832.1600000000003s)]
*  It's such a great way to get food because there's no natural predators. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2836.88s)]
*  They literally have to be hunted. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2841.2200000000003s)]
*  And there's fucking thousands of them. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2843.28s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2845.6000000000004s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2846.6000000000004s)]
*  When we did Lanai, remember when we had the dream team? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2847.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, such a good trip. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2849.1200000000003s)]
*  We had to do it again, man. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2850.1200000000003s)]
*  It was you, me, Cam Haynes, John Dudley, Adam Green Tree, Remy Warren, Ben O'Brien. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2852.88s)]
*  Benny. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2860.12s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2861.12s)]
*  It was such a good crew. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2862.12s)]
*  What a crew. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2863.12s)]
*  I know, it was wild. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2864.12s)]
*  What a great time we had. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2865.12s)]
*  And then we did that podcast in my hotel room. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2866.12s)]
*  Lot of deer got killed that week. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2868.4s)]
*  Lot of deer. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2869.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2870.84s)]
*  That gave a lot of people a very delusional perspective of how easy it is to hunt access [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2871.84s)]
*  deer in Lanai though. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2874.84s)]
*  The guides told me that they had 150 hunters come in after us and one of them was successful. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2876.56s)]
*  One. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2881.36s)]
*  Everybody else pulled a rifle. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2882.84s)]
*  It's so hard. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2883.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2884.84s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2885.84s)]
*  I always tell people that. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2886.84s)]
*  I'm like, I'll see a thousand deer in a day. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2887.84s)]
*  It's not unusual for me to see a thousand deer in a day. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2890.0s)]
*  And they're like, how'd you only get one? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2892.28s)]
*  How'd you get none? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2894.2400000000002s)]
*  Sometimes I go access to your hunting in Hawaii for three days straight and not get one. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2896.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, easily. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2899.32s)]
*  Easily. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2900.32s)]
*  It is so hard to get close enough into bow range where you're trying to get 30 yards [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2901.32s)]
*  away from a deer and there's 200 deer in front of you in a herd. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2905.1600000000003s)]
*  I have a video of a shot, I'll try to find it on my phone, but I have a video of a shot [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2909.2s)]
*  I took at 80 yards and it's a perfect shot. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2913.72s)]
*  This arrow's arcing right towards the vitals at 80 yards. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2917.0s)]
*  When the arrow's 10 yards away from the deer, it's like, and he's gone. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2920.68s)]
*  Not there. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2925.96s)]
*  10 yards. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2926.96s)]
*  The arrow's going, I don't know how fast it was going by the time it got to him, but on [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2927.96s)]
*  the way there, it's going 275 feet a second. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2931.3599999999997s)]
*  And when it got close to him, he heard it and he was, they've evolved to get away from [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2934.32s)]
*  tigers. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2939.96s)]
*  Isn't that insane? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2940.96s)]
*  Those motherfuckers are so twitchy. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2941.96s)]
*  They're so fast. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2943.32s)]
*  Jamie, can you pull up Instagram? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2944.32s)]
*  Can you go to Matt Miola, his page, one of my really good friends that I bow hunt with [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2947.28s)]
*  in Hawaii. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2951.36s)]
*  How do you spell Miola? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2952.36s)]
*  M-E-O-L-A. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2953.36s)]
*  This guy is one of my favorite human beings, by the way. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2954.96s)]
*  He's a legend. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2957.36s)]
*  Really good bow hunter, great surfer, one of the best air surfers in the world. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2958.7200000000003s)]
*  Air? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2961.92s)]
*  What's an air surfer? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2962.92s)]
*  He's incredible at airs. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2964.56s)]
*  See that air up on the upper right? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2965.56s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2966.56s)]
*  He's the man. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2967.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2968.56s)]
*  If you scroll down, yeah, if you scroll down, there's one, he's so funny, this guy. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2969.56s)]
*  Great fisherman, great bow hunter. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2975.16s)]
*  Okay, go back up. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2977.16s)]
*  In the middle, right there. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2979.86s)]
*  The axis deer? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2980.86s)]
*  No, right in the middle. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2981.86s)]
*  I think this one, if you see it, it'll show he's taking shots at axis deer and you'll [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2982.86s)]
*  see his arrow in the air. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2987.56s)]
*  You see it? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2989.84s)]
*  And watch the deer. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2990.84s)]
*  It's going perfect. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2991.96s)]
*  He's like, fuck it, let me get out of here. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2993.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2995.4s)]
*  That was a perfect shot and a clean miss at the same time. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2996.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=2999.92s)]
*  They're so fast. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3000.92s)]
*  There's another one right here. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3001.92s)]
*  Well, when we went to Lanai, I know it's crazy. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3003.6s)]
*  The arrows are going so fast. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3009.4s)]
*  So fast. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3010.96s)]
*  And the deer are faster. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3011.96s)]
*  They just duck and run. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3012.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3014.76s)]
*  The amount of perfect shots you've made and completely missed is crazy. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3015.76s)]
*  When you see them in slow mo and you realize, oh, I don't suck, these things are fucking [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3019.92s)]
*  grease lightning. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3024.44s)]
*  But they will make you throw your bow in the air. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3025.44s)]
*  They'll make you buy a rifle. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3027.6000000000004s)]
*  I know so many people who have tried to go bow hunting for axis deer and ended up shooting [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3029.36s)]
*  one with a rifle. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3033.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, with a rifle, it's more ethical because the reality is with a rifle, you're going [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3034.6800000000003s)]
*  to 100% get a deer. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3039.76s)]
*  And if you want to get that meat, that's the way to do it because they can't dodge bullets. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3042.88s)]
*  If you're filling the freezer, that's the best way. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3048.92s)]
*  100%. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3050.7200000000003s)]
*  By far the best way. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3051.7200000000003s)]
*  The best way to do it. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3052.88s)]
*  And I'm not opposed to rifle hunting. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3053.88s)]
*  I shot a pig last week with a rifle. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3055.32s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3058.6400000000003s)]
*  And after a long ass bow hunt, I just loved having it on a rest, looking at that fucking [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3059.6400000000003s)]
*  reticle and just boom. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3065.92s)]
*  He stoned him and he just dropped dead. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3068.04s)]
*  Now he's a big ass fucking pig. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3070.12s)]
*  So I have, I mean, who knows how many pounds of sausage I'm going to get from this. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3073.48s)]
*  This is going to be amazing. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3078.16s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3079.16s)]
*  They make great sausage. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3080.16s)]
*  But he was a fat boy. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3081.3999999999996s)]
*  I've only killed one animal with a gun. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3082.7999999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3084.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3085.92s)]
*  The first animal I ever killed. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3086.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3088.52s)]
*  That's a freaking dinosaur, dude. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3090.0s)]
*  Big ass pig. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3091.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3092.48s)]
*  Big ass wild boar. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3093.48s)]
*  And where I was at in California, they're overwhelmed with them. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3095.2s)]
*  We saw hundreds of pigs every day. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3099.24s)]
*  Hard to get close to though, right? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3101.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3102.64s)]
*  They're very, very smart. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3103.64s)]
*  Like rolling hills. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3104.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3105.64s)]
*  Very smart. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3106.64s)]
*  It's so much easier. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3108.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3109.12s)]
*  All you have to do is just squeeze it. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3110.12s)]
*  Don't move. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3111.92s)]
*  Boom. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3112.92s)]
*  There's so much less moving stuff. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3113.92s)]
*  For sure. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3115.72s)]
*  When you're at full draw and you've got your anchor point, I have a nose button. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3116.72s)]
*  So I have to touch this thing to my nose and I have to make sure that my finger is like [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3119.72s)]
*  right under my jaw line. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3124.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3125.7999999999997s)]
*  A lot of things. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3126.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3127.7999999999997s)]
*  There's like a lot of shit going on that has to be my elbow. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3128.7999999999997s)]
*  Make sure it's up in the air and not like this. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3130.44s)]
*  You know, there's like so many, like you have to like, I have to think the bubble has to [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3133.52s)]
*  be leveled. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3137.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3138.48s)]
*  Make sure the housing is centered in the peep site. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3139.48s)]
*  And you're going through all this while you're in this like high pressure situation with [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3141.68s)]
*  this fucking massive elk of a lifetime is standing in front of you at 50 yards. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3146.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3150.64s)]
*  And then you got to put the pin on its vitals. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3151.64s)]
*  Then your nerves are going. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3152.64s)]
*  So you got to make sure you're centering that pin and make sure that pin's not moving too [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3153.64s)]
*  much and then the shot breaks perfect. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3156.36s)]
*  But when it does happen and you hear that, whack, and then the elk runs off. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3158.92s)]
*  In this case in California, my elk died in literally 10 seconds. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3164.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3168.56s)]
*  It was the fastest I've ever had an elk die. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3169.56s)]
*  It was a perfect quartering away shot. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3170.96s)]
*  So it shot through the ribs like a little back. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3173.52s)]
*  So you know, quartering away shot. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3177.6800000000003s)]
*  What that means folks is instead of the animal standing completely sideways, it's slightly [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3179.26s)]
*  facing away. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3185.2000000000003s)]
*  So it's looking away from you slightly, which is actually a much better shot because then [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3186.76s)]
*  you're going through like three and a half, four feet of body cavity with a broadhead. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3192.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3196.68s)]
*  Opens up the vitals. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3197.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3198.68s)]
*  And the animal died almost instantly. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3199.68s)]
*  It ran for 80 yards, like as much as it could before it just died and it died instantly. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3200.68s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3207.72s)]
*  So I'm totally not opposed to rifle hunting at all. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3209.72s)]
*  I think rifles are great for filling the freezer and totally ethical hunting. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3212.0s)]
*  But for you that rifle hunt sometimes and bow hunt sometimes, the feeling of making [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3217.24s)]
*  the perfect archery shot on a bull elk and the feeling of seeing that arrow go through [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3221.4799999999996s)]
*  the air and hit it exactly where you aimed and that elk going down in 10 seconds, it's [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3226.56s)]
*  a different feeling, right? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3231.64s)]
*  It's way better. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3232.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3233.64s)]
*  It's much, much, much, much, much more difficult because you can have a very ethical shot on [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3234.64s)]
*  a deer with a rifle at 200 yards where the deer might not have any idea you're even there. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3240.72s)]
*  Especially if you're prone. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3246.96s)]
*  So if you have a pack and you rest your rifle on the pack and you're lying down in your [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3248.48s)]
*  stomach and you breathe out and relax, that bullet is flying so straight. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3252.7599999999998s)]
*  If your rifle is zeroed and you look at the reticle and you get those crosshairs perfectly [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3259.2s)]
*  on the vitals, that's a dead deer. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3265.24s)]
*  100%. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3267.3599999999997s)]
*  Whereas with bow hunting, you've got wind, you've got all sorts of shit going on and [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3268.3599999999997s)]
*  you have to get so close that you're within the animal senses. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3274.32s)]
*  When I crept up on this elk that I shot last week, I wore two pairs of wool socks. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3278.36s)]
*  I took my shoes off because I could creep in because he was bedded. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3283.76s)]
*  It was so damn cool. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3287.84s)]
*  It was so cool because it was the perfect opportunity because he was bedded and he was [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3289.2000000000003s)]
*  looking away from me. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3293.0400000000004s)]
*  I was like, oh, he's dead. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3294.28s)]
*  He's dead. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3296.1200000000003s)]
*  I just have to do this the right way. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3297.1200000000003s)]
*  I started out at 110 yards and I crept in very slowly, the final 60 yards because there [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3299.04s)]
*  was a bunch of shit in the way. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3305.56s)]
*  I had to get to 50. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3306.7599999999998s)]
*  I got to 60, I was like, I like it, but I don't like these branches and shit. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3308.36s)]
*  I got to get to the right, which is another 10 yards. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3312.24s)]
*  It took me another 10 minutes. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3314.7599999999998s)]
*  It was nice and slow. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3316.7599999999998s)]
*  When I got to 50 and he was still bedded, I'm like, oh, he's dead. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3319.04s)]
*  I just have to wait for him to stand up. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3322.64s)]
*  Then eventually he got up, stretched his legs out and whack. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3324.64s)]
*  Were you on your knees or standing up? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3327.8s)]
*  Standing. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3329.0s)]
*  I was standing in the tree. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3330.0s)]
*  There's actually a video of it. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3331.0s)]
*  It's on my Instagram. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3332.0s)]
*  Very cool. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3333.0s)]
*  Pull that video up because it's dope because you see how good the Origin camo is. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3334.0s)]
*  We're working with Origin now. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3337.76s)]
*  Origin is Jocko's company and Cam Haines, me and Kip Folks who started Under Armour, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3340.5600000000004s)]
*  we're working for them. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3345.76s)]
*  That's me right up there. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3346.76s)]
*  Look how well I blend in and whack. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3348.92s)]
*  You can actually hear it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3351.76s)]
*  Give you the volume so you can hear the whole thing, which is for a bow hunter, listen to [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3353.56s)]
*  the sweet shot. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3358.44s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3359.44s)]
*  That's what you want to hear. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3360.44s)]
*  Great noise right there. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3363.44s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3364.84s)]
*  It's also interesting, at 50 yards, listen to this. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3365.84s)]
*  There's half a second. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3371.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3374.12s)]
*  That's enough time. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3375.12s)]
*  For an axis deer, that motherfucker would be gone. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3376.12s)]
*  Gone. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3377.92s)]
*  Hard to imagine. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3378.92s)]
*  But the elk, he had no idea what that was. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3379.92s)]
*  He didn't even look. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3381.88s)]
*  He just heard the slap into his body and he was gone. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  He was gone in 10 seconds. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3388.1200000000003s)]
*  That's the other difference too. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3389.6000000000004s)]
*  Gun hunting and bow hunting, it's so different. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3391.52s)]
*  I guess there's two super big things that I can think of are super different. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3396.52s)]
*  One is if that elk was behind some grass or a brush, you'd still shoot. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3401.1200000000003s)]
*  If you aim well, it's going to go right through that shit. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3406.3s)]
*  With an arrow, there's no chance. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3408.48s)]
*  The other thing is if you're going archery hunting for elk or axis deer or something [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3411.12s)]
*  like that, you've got to practice a lot. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3415.9599999999996s)]
*  With a gun, if that thing is zeroed in and you've shot a gun before, the animal's dead. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3419.68s)]
*  I hadn't shot a rifle in over a year. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3424.4399999999996s)]
*  I shot that pig. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3426.64s)]
*  Imagine doing that with a bow and bow hunting. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3427.64s)]
*  I would never do it. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3429.64s)]
*  I would never do it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3430.64s)]
*  I would never even think about doing it. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3431.64s)]
*  That's a huge difference. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3432.64s)]
*  I would never even consider doing it. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3433.64s)]
*  It would be unethical for sure. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3436.0s)]
*  In Texas, it was 105 degrees in the summer. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3439.2s)]
*  I was outside in the summer every day for three hours practicing. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3441.96s)]
*  I'd bring a 64-inch hydro flask and I'd fill it up with water and liquid IV. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3445.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd just be drinking electrolytes all day and just shooting. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3451.2s)]
*  That was the way that I did it. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3455.44s)]
*  I would come in and I would be drenched like I just jumped in the pool. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3457.24s)]
*  That's what you have to do. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3463.0s)]
*  You have to. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3464.04s)]
*  I have a 40-yard range indoors here, which is great. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3465.04s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3468.7599999999998s)]
*  But it's not enough. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3469.7599999999998s)]

*  I don't shoot things at a really long distance, but I'll practice at 100. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3471.7599999999998s)]
*  The reason I practice at 100 ... Oh, Jesus. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3477.3199999999997s)]

*  Well, the reason I practice at 100 is not to shoot something at 100. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3481.4399999999996s)]
*  It's because when I get to 50, I've got it. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3486.48s)]
*  50 yards to me is an easy shot. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3489.24s)]
*  That's what they say, right? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3491.56s)]
*  You want to practice at twice the distance that is your effective range. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3492.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3496.0s)]
*  When you get nervous, it all depended upon how calm you can stay. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3497.04s)]
*  One of the things is certain people like yourself are very good at being calm in high-pressure [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3501.08s)]
*  situations because you've done so many high-pressure things. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3505.88s)]
*  When you're big wave surfing, I've got to imagine ... I've seen some of the fucking [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3509.88s)]
*  waves you ride. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3512.76s)]
*  That is got to be a crazy rush. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3514.2s)]
*  You got to keep your shit together and you're balancing yourself out on the forces of nature [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3518.04s)]
*  of millions of pounds of water that's working at an insane rate. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3522.84s)]

*  You got to keep your shit together while you're on that. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3529.32s)]
*  It makes sense to me why so many surfers get into bow hunting because it's another way [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3533.0s)]

*  When you're at the plate, it's a little bit. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3557.4s)]
*  If you're just a baseball player or something, you have no high-pressure situations. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3559.04s)]
*  In high school. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3562.2400000000002s)]

*  If you like baseball, good for you. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3571.48s)]
*  But the point is, it's like if you're a guy who just has an office job and there's a little [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3573.0s)]
*  bit of pressure and work or stress, there's a giant difference between managing your physical [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3578.72s)]

*  No doubt. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3605.0s)]
*  It was a huge challenge. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3606.0s)]
*  The battle to overcome fear or pressure in a moment is huge. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3608.52s)]
*  That's why I love bowhunting. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3613.24s)]
*  That's why I love it. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3614.24s)]
*  That moment when there's that elk and you know that this is your time, this is your [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3615.32s)]
*  window, and every single thing that you've done in the last six months, every shot that [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3618.76s)]
*  you've taken, every target you've worn out is just critical on that specific moment. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3622.32s)]
*  You have to keep mentally calm, like you said, and in the zone. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3627.0s)]
*  You see that arrow hit exactly where you aimed in that pressure cooker situation. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3630.76s)]
*  There's nothing like it. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3635.84s)]
*  I never thought I'd find something like that besides surfing really big waves. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3637.36s)]
*  Now I have. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3641.92s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3642.92s)]
*  A lot of fighters say that too, and a lot of athletes like Derek Wolfe who played for [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3643.92s)]
*  the NFL, he's found a great relief and a great discipline in bowhunting. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3646.44s)]
*  He's really dived full into it. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3652.0s)]
*  That's a thing for a lot of folks. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3654.88s)]
*  A lot of veterans that return back, that's a thing that really helps them. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3655.88s)]
*  Assimilate and just find some new thing that's like this discipline that they can high pressure. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3660.6s)]
*  Also for me, when I'm sitting down and I'm eating a meal and I'm cooking a meal for my [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3666.2s)]
*  family and we're all sitting there eating, this is something that I got myself. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3670.24s)]
*  I harvested this myself. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3673.84s)]
*  There's an intense connection with your food. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3676.24s)]
*  It's the best meat in the world, the best protein in the world. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3679.84s)]

*  I love seeing it on your ... I really love seeing it on your Instagram that you eat your [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3684.4s)]
*  wild game all the time. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3689.8s)]
*  I actually know hunters that ... Especially when I first started hunting, it was kind [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3691.28s)]
*  of rare amongst my hunting friend group to actually make their own game. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3695.36s)]
*  They just love bowhunting, but it wasn't like the meat part was a huge part of it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3700.6000000000004s)]
*  My wife eats axis steer twice a day. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3706.04s)]
*  She eats it at lunch and she eats it at dinner almost every day. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3710.04s)]
*  It's kind of wild. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3713.92s)]
*  Even when I'm not even home, she cooks it for my kids. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3714.92s)]
*  It's delicious. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3717.1600000000003s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3718.52s)]
*  When I first started hunting, she wasn't super into it. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3719.52s)]
*  Now that she eats it every day, she just doesn't want to eat anything else, which is really [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3722.0s)]
*  cool. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3726.24s)]
*  It's so good for you. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3727.24s)]
*  It's the most nutrient dense food in the world. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3728.24s)]
*  Axis deer has an amazing flavor. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3730.6s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3733.72s)]
*  It's almost sweet. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3734.72s)]
*  Axis deer has got this beautiful, amazing, renewable resource, especially where you live, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3736.92s)]
*  you literally have to kill them. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3746.0s)]
*  They have to. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3748.12s)]
*  There's no predators, unless you want to bring tigers to Lanai. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3749.12s)]
*  That's what you would have to bring. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3753.8799999999997s)]
*  People will argue with that, but the problem is in Hawaii, the deer were introduced. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3755.48s)]
*  There's native forests, there's native birds. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3764.0s)]
*  They have a huge impact on the land. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3765.56s)]
*  If you just let them go, their numbers get so big and then there's a drought in a place [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3768.48s)]
*  all of a sudden it won't rain for six months and the feed goes away. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3773.96s)]
*  Then you have 10,000 deer with no food. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3777.2s)]
*  What happens is they die these horrible, miserable deaths. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3779.3199999999997s)]
*  You have to keep those numbers in check. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3782.7999999999997s)]
*  That way, when there is a drought, they still all live. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3784.16s)]
*  They're much healthier that way. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3786.12s)]
*  Also it provides very cheap meat to these people that live there. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3787.84s)]
*  It's the most incredible resource for them. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3793.56s)]
*  You go to Lanai, the Four Seasons of Lanai is excellent. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3796.4s)]

*  It's so great that you can stay at the Four Seasons and then go bow hunting. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3801.6400000000003s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3804.28s)]
*  They have Axis sliders that they sell. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3805.6s)]
*  What is that restaurant that's there? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3808.6400000000003s)]
*  Malibu Farms? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3812.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3813.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3814.0s)]

*  On Lanai? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3816.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3817.0s)]
*  At the Four Seasons. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3818.0s)]
*  They have Axis sliders. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3819.0s)]
*  They're so fucking good. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3820.0s)]
*  They're so good. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3821.0s)]
*  Axis is such a fantastic meat. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3822.0s)]
*  But if I had to pick one, it's elk. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3824.0s)]
*  That's my favorite meat by far. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3825.36s)]
*  Maybe it's because of the experience. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3828.16s)]
*  The meat is absolutely delicious too. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3830.72s)]
*  I can cook it so many different ways. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3833.16s)]
*  I make elk stew. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3834.64s)]

*  When's the last time you made yourself an elk steak and you got halfway through and [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3842.08s)]
*  you weren't hungry enough for the rest and just threw the rest in the trash? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3846.3999999999996s)]
*  Zero times. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3849.12s)]
*  It always goes in the fridge. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3850.12s)]
*  That's pretty cool, right? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3851.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3852.12s)]
*  Think of all the people who eat half a steak and then just send it back in the restaurant. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3853.12s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3856.96s)]
*  They didn't even think that that's an animal. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3858.76s)]
*  But it's a good connection. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3859.76s)]
*  It's very, very different when you've hunted it yourself. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3860.76s)]
*  My kids eat it. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3864.36s)]
*  Everybody eats it. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3865.36s)]
*  I just think it makes you healthier. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3866.36s)]
*  It's just better for you. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3867.6s)]
*  It's so nutrient dense. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3868.6s)]
*  You feel like you can run through a brick wall and eat that. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3870.36s)]
*  I know. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3873.32s)]
*  It looks so different too. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3874.32s)]
*  When you look at it, it's like this dark red meat, like red gold. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3875.32s)]
*  I love it when you get really, really fit and people are like, bro, what are you eating? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3880.76s)]
*  I'm like, just deer meat. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3888.5600000000004s)]
*  That's the bad. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3889.5600000000004s)]
*  It's true. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3890.5600000000004s)]
*  Literally, that's pretty much all I eat. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3891.5600000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3892.5600000000004s)]
*  It's very, very, very good for you. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3893.5600000000004s)]
*  It really is good. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3895.7200000000003s)]
*  If you're trying to get fit and you're working out and you're trying to eat really, really [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3896.7200000000003s)]
*  good nutritious food, if you're eating venison, man, crazy results. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3899.96s)]
*  If you're a person that doesn't have the patience for bow hunting or it doesn't appeal to you, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3905.0400000000004s)]
*  get a rifle. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3908.8s)]
*  Get a rifle. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3909.8s)]
*  Go to Maui. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3910.8s)]
*  Go to Lanai. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3911.8s)]
*  You can shoot three or four deer. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3912.8s)]
*  Or Texas. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3913.8s)]
*  Yeah, or Texas. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3914.8s)]
*  There's a lot of them in Texas. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3915.8s)]
*  In Texas, it's a little weirder because a lot of these places are these high fence places [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3917.4s)]
*  where these animals are essentially contained in a park. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3922.84s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3926.4s)]
*  That's not my type of hunting, but if you're just going for the meat. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3928.0s)]
*  If you're going for the meat, I don't care. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3930.6s)]
*  Shoot them in the fence. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3932.6s)]
*  Don't shoot them in the fence. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3933.6s)]
*  Doesn't even matter. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3934.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3935.6s)]
*  If you're trying to feel the freezer. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3936.6s)]
*  One of the things that I also find is that you really need practice. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3937.6s)]
*  You don't want your first shot of the year on a live animal to be an elk that's like [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3942.08s)]
*  a 350 elk in Utah that's going through the woods and you've got a small gap to shoot [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3947.2799999999997s)]
*  it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3951.7599999999998s)]
*  You're like, ah! [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3952.7599999999998s)]
*  You really would need reps. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3953.7599999999998s)]
*  Pigs provide the best reps in Texas. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3955.56s)]
*  Most definitely. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3957.64s)]
*  They have to kill them. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3958.64s)]
*  They're fucking everywhere. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3959.64s)]
*  It's a plague. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3960.64s)]
*  There's a friend of mine who has a friend of mine, my friend Tyler, shout out to Archery [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3961.64s)]
*  Country, best bow shop in the world. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3964.7999999999997s)]
*  It's out here in Austin. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3967.0s)]
*  We go to, there's a hunting lease that he has and we go out there and it's fucking swarming [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3968.36s)]
*  with pigs. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3974.1600000000003s)]
*  You can practice on pigs. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3976.1200000000003s)]
*  You get this amazing meat from those pigs and you can get those shots in, which I think [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3977.76s)]
*  are critical. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3983.44s)]
*  There's so many bases you have to cover if you want to be a successful bow hunter. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3984.44s)]
*  One of the things I should shout out is Joel Turner because this shot IQ system that Joel [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3989.56s)]
*  Turner has developed, he's a sniper and he worked with SWAT teams and he developed, he [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=3994.44s)]
*  was trying to figure out what is it about these high pressure situations that cause [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4002.92s)]
*  people to flinch and panic and get target panic and fuck up shots and especially in [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4007.12s)]
*  a hostage situation like with a sniper, it's insanely important that you keep your shit [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4012.36s)]
*  together. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4017.44s)]
*  Because you might have to make a head shot on someone who has a knife to a hostage. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4018.44s)]
*  You can't mess that up. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4022.32s)]
*  You can't mess that up. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4023.32s)]
*  Joel researched what happens to the mind and what are closed loop and open loop systems. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4025.36s)]
*  An open loop system is like when you're swinging a bat at a ball. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4034.44s)]
*  You can't stop it. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4038.8s)]
*  You're swinging that bat and once you initiate that movement, it's going. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4040.44s)]
*  It's going. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4045.44s)]
*  A closed loop system is at any time you can stop. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4046.44s)]
*  During the process of a shot, you are well aware of what, you're not just hammering the [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4051.36s)]
*  trigger and flinching and panicking. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4055.56s)]
*  What you're doing is going through this very specific shot process. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4057.88s)]
*  I have things that I say to myself in my mind while it's going on. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4061.32s)]
*  I keep talking to myself so I'm never flinching and panicking and freaking out. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4066.12s)]
*  I stay in my shot process and because of Joel, I've been much, much better at keeping my [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4070.6400000000003s)]
*  shit together during those. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4077.96s)]
*  I've been doing that for about five years now. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4080.24s)]
*  Is that a book or a podcast or something? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4082.24s)]
*  He's got a website. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4083.7999999999997s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4084.7999999999997s)]
*  ShotIQ.com. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4085.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just information that you consume and then you practice it? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4086.7999999999997s)]
*  He breaks it down to you. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4090.2s)]
*  One of the things that he makes- Is it video based, the stuff he does? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4091.68s)]
*  Video based. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4094.4799999999996s)]
*  I'll have to check that out. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4095.4799999999996s)]
*  He talks about it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4096.48s)]
*  He's thoroughly researched this. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4097.48s)]
*  He keeps improving it and updating it. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4101.32s)]
*  I know world class archers like Levi Morgan who use it. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4105.56s)]
*  He's literally the greatest archer of all time. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4110.240000000001s)]
*  He uses it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4112.84s)]
*  These guys use it in order to have a process that you utilize while you're in the middle [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4114.52s)]
*  of a shot to keep talking to yourself. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4120.280000000001s)]
*  Cam Haynes developed his own process on his own and didn't necessarily know that that's [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4122.6s)]
*  what he was doing. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4129.400000000001s)]
*  He just knew what was best for him. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4130.400000000001s)]
*  He puts the pin on the animal and then he says to himself, keep the pin on him, keep [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4133.84s)]
*  the pin on him, keep the pin on him, keep the pin on him. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4138.76s)]
*  Boom, the shot breaks. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4141.4800000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4142.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4143.4800000000005s)]
*  He's going through it in his mind. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4144.4800000000005s)]
*  When he's at full draw on an animal, he's like, keep the pin on him, keep the pin on [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4145.4800000000005s)]
*  him, and the shot breaks. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4149.28s)]
*  Whereas some people, they see the- They just fucking flinch and then they fucking hit him [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4151.76s)]
*  in the antlers. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4156.32s)]
*  They just- So many people freak out in that moment. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4157.32s)]
*  Having a process, I think the biggest thing is just even if your process isn't perfect, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4161.799999999999s)]
*  having a process to think about instead of thinking about the pressure, start thinking [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4165.2s)]
*  about that moment. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4170.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4171.04s)]
*  When you're just sitting there at full draw and you're like, hey, pin on the animal, get [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4172.04s)]
*  my anchor really good, look at the bubble, okay, first pin for sure or third pin for [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4175.599999999999s)]
*  sure. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4179.92s)]
*  He's at 50, it's a third pin or whatever it is. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4180.92s)]
*  Having that process and then high elbow, pull through, pull through the shot and then like- [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4183.36s)]
*  And follow the arrow. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4188.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4189.16s)]
*  Follow through. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4190.16s)]
*  I think just having that process and really talking to yourself in that pressure cooker [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4192.0s)]
*  moment is the way for sure. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4195.599999999999s)]
*  Remy has an interesting thing he says too. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4197.4s)]
*  Remy says, be the arrow. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4200.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4201.76s)]
*  Yeah, which I like. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4202.76s)]
*  I incorporated that too. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4204.12s)]
*  I like that, this idea of be the arrow. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4205.5599999999995s)]
*  You are literally thinking you are the arrow. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4209.76s)]
*  You know where you want that arrow to go. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4212.44s)]
*  You're concentrating on that. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4214.28s)]
*  Be the arrow. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4215.72s)]
*  Then when he releases that shot, he's following it. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4216.72s)]
*  He is the arrow. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4219.2s)]
*  Very few people are more successful than Remy. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4221.4400000000005s)]
*  One of my bow hunting mentors, Jeff, he used to take me bow hunting when I was a lot younger. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4224.76s)]
*  He goes, you know what I used to always tell myself when I was at full draw and right before [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4233.16s)]
*  the arrow broke? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4236.08s)]
*  He said I would look at the animal and the last thing I would do is say you're going [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4237.76s)]
*  to fucking die. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4240.64s)]
*  That's intense. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4241.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4242.64s)]
*  It sounds kind of messed up. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4243.64s)]
*  There's all these non-hunters listening to this like, whoa, that's really messed up. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4246.0s)]
*  But he goes, think about it psychologically. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4250.0s)]
*  That's what you're doing in that moment. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4252.48s)]
*  You got to really embrace that instead of hoping, instead of coming from a perspective [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4254.2s)]
*  of hope. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4258.08s)]
*  Like, oh, I hope that arrow gets there in the right spot. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4259.08s)]
*  I hope I don't mess this up. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4261.12s)]
*  It's like that confirmation in your mind telling yourself that this is what you're doing here. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4263.4s)]
*  This is the intention. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4267.32s)]
*  The arrow is going to go there and that's what's going to happen. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4268.32s)]
*  And believing instead of hoping. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4270.56s)]
*  That's the difference. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4272.56s)]
*  The way he said it was interesting. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4274.44s)]
*  But he's like, it's powerful, honestly. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4276.76s)]
*  So having a process and being super confident that all the work is paying off in the moment [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4279.2s)]
*  you're going to make that shot is key. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4283.4s)]
*  It is a discipline. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4285.04s)]
*  And if you want to take this journey, you have to understand it's a discipline and it [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4286.5599999999995s)]
*  requires work. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4291.88s)]
*  It requires a lot of work and a lot of thinking and it's going to be a lot of pressure. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4293.0s)]
*  But that's what I like about it. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4298.08s)]
*  And again, at the end, the end result is it's so rewarding. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4300.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4303.36s)]
*  Isn't it crazy? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4304.36s)]
*  I don't know if this is going to take us down a rabbit hole, but. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4305.36s)]
*  I like rabbit holes. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4308.8s)]
*  It's just tripping. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4309.8s)]
*  The fact that we're here in your studio talking about bowhunting and food. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4310.92s)]
*  And there's a war. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4316.24s)]
*  There's like people putting missiles together into a machine like some launcher thing right [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4317.24s)]
*  now and. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4321.4400000000005s)]
*  Israel is about to. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4324.4400000000005s)]
*  Right at this moment. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4326.12s)]
*  Gaza. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4327.12s)]
*  They're talking about a ground invasion of Gaza and they're preparing for it. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4328.12s)]
*  So gnarly. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4332.52s)]
*  This is terrifying. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4333.52s)]
*  It's so terrifying because it's we're so close to World War Three. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4335.28s)]
*  We're so close. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4340.24s)]
*  It's no joke, man. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4341.24s)]
*  It's really that's really feels like that's what's happening. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4342.44s)]
*  It is happening. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4345.0s)]
*  Yeah, it scares the fucking shit out of me. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4346.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does mean to. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4347.5199999999995s)]
*  And someone from the government was just having some sort of a press conference. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4348.5199999999995s)]
*  They're saying, you know, we are at war and war is messy. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4352.12s)]
*  And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4355.88s)]
*  Shouldn't we be doing everything we can to avoid this? [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4359.36s)]
*  single possible thing that we can to avoid this. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4363.44s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like they look ahead. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4366.76s)]
*  They just go, here's what we got to do. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4369.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4371.36s)]
*  Here's what we have to do. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4372.36s)]
*  Like, I get it. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4373.36s)]
*  I get it. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4374.36s)]
*  It's like what happened on October 7th was it is horrible. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4375.36s)]
*  Absolute atrocity and like barbaric and absolutely terrible. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4379.8s)]
*  And I get it. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4384.28s)]
*  You have to retaliate. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4385.28s)]
*  You have to do what you got to do. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4386.28s)]
*  But how do you do that? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4389.679999999999s)]
*  Like, like, of course you want to get rid of Hamas. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4390.679999999999s)]
*  That sounds great. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4392.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4393.84s)]
*  I completely support that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4394.84s)]
*  I think everybody supports that for the most part. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4396.4400000000005s)]
*  But how do you do that without so much collateral damage? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4398.96s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4401.72s)]
*  And then even more important than that is fast forward five years from now. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4402.72s)]
*  What happens like what are the repercussions? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4407.12s)]
*  Yeah, especially around that whole area with all those Arab countries. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4409.360000000001s)]
*  And we're backing that. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4413.72s)]
*  We're backing them, killing all these people there. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4414.96s)]
*  And we're also backing Ukraine against Russia. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4418.3s)]
*  And now it's look like we're going to back Taiwan. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4422.02s)]
*  We just sent an aid, an aid, an aid package to Taiwan, billions of dollars to Taiwan. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4425.46s)]
*  It's like we're opposing all these like, you know what I mean? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4431.46s)]
*  We're opposing China, Russia and now these Arab countries. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4434.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary, man. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4436.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm not the person to talk politics with that. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4438.3s)]
*  I mean, or, you know, you know, international military strategy. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4440.34s)]
*  But I just watching the news and trying not to and just try. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4444.5s)]
*  It's funny because I, I mean, I've always known about Israel and Palestine, just from [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4449.58s)]
*  what I hear on the news and like just sort of hearing, like kind of understanding on [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4456.66s)]
*  the most surface level. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4460.5s)]
*  And it wasn't till now, age 51, where I was actually I've been watching, like listening [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4461.9400000000005s)]
*  to podcasts, watching documentaries, trying to like educate myself and like figure out [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4465.7s)]
*  what this conflict, how it came to be, what the history was. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4470.1s)]
*  And it's the more I try to learn about it, the more complicated it seems. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4473.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrifying. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4479.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrifying. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4480.34s)]
*  And the consequences for all of us are so grave because if it does go completely sideways, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4481.46s)]
*  if someone goes nuclear, we're fucked. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4485.98s)]
*  We're fucked. The world's fucked. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4489.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, we're getting knocked back into the Stone Age if we're lucky, if we're lucky. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4490.54s)]
*  If we're not lucky, the whole human race gets wiped out. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4495.22s)]
*  And all it takes is one person to go rogue. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4498.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4500.66s)]
*  And like you saw the like for Hamas to do what they did in Israel, that was totally [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4501.14s)]
*  strategic. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4512.740000000001s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4514.22s)]
*  They didn't like do all that barbaric shit in that way, like just to prove a point. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4515.1s)]
*  It was super like they wanted a crazy emotional response. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4520.34s)]
*  They were trying to escalate the situation, obviously, right? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4525.5s)]
*  You would never do that without going, what is this going to do? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4528.42s)]
*  Because obviously, they're going to pull on airstrikes, ground invasion. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4531.820000000001s)]
*  It's pretty obvious that that's going to happen. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4537.38s)]
*  So they basically wanted that to happen. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4539.7s)]
*  They wanted like I listened to the Coleman Hughes podcast. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4541.62s)]
*  You just had Coleman on the show a couple of days ago, whatever that was. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4545.42s)]
*  The way he broke that down, how he simplified everything and like he made so much sense [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4548.46s)]
*  out of it. But I just can't stop thinking about the repercussions of retaliation and [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4552.9s)]
*  escalation and getting every single other country involved. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4561.42s)]

*  When it gets me as late at night when I'm alone, this is even before the Hamas invasion. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4567.5s)]
*  It was just thinking about Ukraine and Russia. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4574.98s)]
*  I would be at home and just go through the news feed and read some stories. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4577.98s)]
*  And then everyone in my house would be asleep and I'd be awake. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4583.86s)]
*  And I was just going, fuck, is this the last days of normal civilization? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4586.139999999999s)]

*  For sure. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4655.5s)]
*  I read this thing that there's like six to 10 million people that came across the southern [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4656.5s)]

*  I've been in California a lot the last few months. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4669.62s)]
*  It's insane how many more people are just obviously all of a sudden just appearing like [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4672.18s)]
*  getting dropped off on like street corners with buses literally just in the middle of [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4679.18s)]
*  nowhere. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4683.660000000001s)]
*  They literally just get off the off the bus with a cell phone. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4684.660000000001s)]
*  But look at New York City. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4686.42s)]
*  And Coleman was explaining how New York City literally has a mandate to house its homeless. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4687.5s)]
*  And that was supposed to be the people that lived there that were down on their luck. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4693.5s)]
*  And now it's people that have come in from other cities and or other countries rather [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4697.54s)]
*  illegally. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4701.18s)]
*  And they're trying to make it so that those people can vote. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4702.42s)]
*  And you see what they're doing with people from Venezuela. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4704.9800000000005s)]
*  They're sending people back from Venezuela. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4708.5s)]
*  Only from Venezuela. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4710.46s)]
*  Yeah, because Venezuela opposes socialism. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4711.46s)]
*  So they're not going to vote Democratic. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4713.32s)]
*  They don't want those people. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4715.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4716.02s)]
*  It's crazy how it's so like when you start thinking about it like that, that sounds like [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4717.580000000001s)]
*  a conspiracy theory, but it's like totally political. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4721.18s)]
*  All these moves. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4723.780000000001s)]

*  Yeah, they're literally importing Democratic voters. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4725.780000000001s)]
*  They think by allowing the borders to be porous and by giving people aid and giving people [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4728.9400000000005s)]
*  housing that you're essentially guaranteeing that if you can rig it so that those people [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4734.18s)]
*  are allowed to vote, those people are going to vote Democratic. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4738.9800000000005s)]
*  And if you could say that, oh, voter ID is racist. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4742.14s)]
*  Like what? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4744.9800000000005s)]

*  And they don't think that. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4748.74s)]

*  Right. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4794.5s)]
*  With like 10 million illegal immigrants here. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4795.5s)]

*  I think everyone thinks a secure border is a good idea. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4884.22s)]
*  Well, it became a political talking point during the Trump administration because people [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4886.78s)]
*  wanted to label Trump as racist and they wanted to label the wall as racist. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4891.0599999999995s)]

*  And everybody that I know, like my military friends that have gone down there and visit, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4930.82s)]
*  like Tim Kennedy is always telling me, you've got to go down there. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4934.3s)]
*  You just go see what's happening. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4936.66s)]
*  And he was telling me this two years ago. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4938.54s)]
*  He was like, two years ago, it's fucking nuts. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4940.9s)]
*  And now it's even worse. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4943.5s)]
*  And I feel like like the problems are like slowly than suddenly with that type of thing. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4945.78s)]
*  We're like, you don't really realize it's like the, you know, like in New York, they're like the sanctuary city. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4950.1s)]
*  Everybody's welcome in New York City. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4954.82s)]
*  Just come here. And then next, you know, every single immigrant that that that went there was getting like a three to five hundred dollar hotel room each night. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4956.1s)]
*  And everybody thought that was a good idea. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4964.5s)]
*  It's just like that's that's what I mean, like slowly than suddenly. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4966.78s)]
*  Like you don't really see the problems until it's overwhelming. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4970.18s)]
*  Well, the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City is no longer a hotel. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4973.38s)]
*  I stayed there before the Roosevelt. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4976.860000000001s)]
*  The last time I was really in New York City, I stayed at the Roosevelt. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4979.18s)]
*  The Roosevelt Hotel is now a complete housing center for migrants. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4981.900000000001s)]
*  Wow, man. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4988.14s)]
*  See if you can find videos of the Roosevelt Hotel today. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4989.1s)]
*  Because the restaurants no longer a restaurant, the hotels no longer a hotel. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4992.7s)]
*  It's 100 percent for migrants. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4997.46s)]
*  And it's overwhelmed and it's more than to capacity. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=4999.1s)]
*  And New York City, from most people I talk to who live there, is a shit show now. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5001.86s)]
*  It's much more of a shit show than this is. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5006.0199999999995s)]
*  This is the Roosevelt Hotel. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5007.66s)]
*  Inside Manhattan's hotel is the new Ellis Island. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5010.42s)]
*  It's crazy, man. It's crazy. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5013.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was just in Tijuana for a week, Joe. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5017.099999999999s)]
*  Very way fewer homeless people in Tijuana. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5021.42s)]
*  Way fewer than in America than in California. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5026.42s)]
*  No fentanyl zombies all over the street. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5029.74s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5033.179999999999s)]
*  I went to T.J. thinking it was going to be super dangerous. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5034.26s)]
*  I had all these assumptions. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5037.34s)]
*  I felt totally safe. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5039.42s)]
*  I ate five-star restaurants right across the street from where I was staying. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5040.38s)]
*  I was staying at the Hyatt Killer Hotel. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5044.74s)]
*  Right across the street, three incredible restaurants. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5046.82s)]
*  I felt completely safe. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5050.66s)]
*  And when I'm in California, there are zombies everywhere. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5051.78s)]
*  The fentanyl problem is so out of control. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5055.26s)]
*  Insane. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5058.22s)]
*  We're fucked. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5059.98s)]
*  We're fucked. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5061.02s)]
*  Did you see this about fentanyl recently? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5061.66s)]
*  Mexico's sit-alone cartels message to members, stop making fentanyl or die. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5064.1s)]
*  Good. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5069.54s)]
*  Crime group yields to intensifying U.S. law enforcement pressure [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5070.38s)]
*  and is kidnapping or killing producers who defy its ban on trafficking the opioid. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5074.3s)]
*  Good. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5078.7s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5078.9s)]
*  Good. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5079.62s)]
*  I'm with them. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5080.46s)]
*  I wonder why. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5081.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's fucking up their business. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5082.66s)]
*  Their business is selling cocaine. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5084.62s)]
*  And then these guys make fentanyl and they cut the cocaine with fentanyl [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5086.54s)]
*  and people are dying. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5089.66s)]
*  And then law enforcement pressure starts ramping up. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5091.46s)]
*  And then what they're really worried about is an invasion. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5093.94s)]
*  The military decides to go after the cartel. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5096.42s)]
*  The cartels are fucked. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5098.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5099.38s)]
*  I mean, they start air striking cartels with jets. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5099.9s)]
*  Gnarly. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5103.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wrap. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5103.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5104.86s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5106.06s)]
*  How crazy is it how the fentanyl these days is mixed with trank? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5106.86s)]
*  Or it's trank? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5111.18s)]
*  Have you heard of that? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5111.86s)]
*  What's trank? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5112.82s)]
*  I can't believe you haven't heard of this. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5114.62s)]
*  With a Q. So trank is fentanyl mixed with a horse tranquilizer. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5116.26s)]
*  So the horse tranquilizer makes the fentanyl last much longer, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5121.38s)]
*  is my understanding. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5124.02s)]
*  Jamie's probably looking it up right now. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5124.780000000001s)]
*  But the trank is a horse tranquilizer. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5126.320000000001s)]
*  They mix it with fentanyl, I think, to make it last longer [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5128.820000000001s)]
*  and make it more powerful. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5131.14s)]
*  And the fucked up thing is it's so toxic, they all inject it. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5132.66s)]
*  It's so toxic that it's so poisonous to your body [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5136.780000000001s)]
*  that your body's trying to get rid of it. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5141.22s)]
*  So it creates these massive sores where the drug is trying to get out. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5143.7s)]
*  I saw that in Russia. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5148.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and people are, no, it's here now, dude, big time. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5149.179999999999s)]
*  People are getting sepsis. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5151.86s)]
*  And having to get their limbs amputated, it's really, really gnarly. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5153.099999999999s)]
*  Go back to that article that you were just posting. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5157.82s)]
*  This is the DA-elect message about it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5160.099999999999s)]
*  OK. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5161.66s)]
*  Xylazine. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5162.16s)]
*  Xylazine is making the deadliest drug threat in our country [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5162.78s)]
*  that our country has ever faced. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5166.58s)]
*  Fentanyl, even deadlier. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5167.9s)]
*  Said administrator Milgram. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5169.94s)]
*  The DEA sees xylazine and fentanyl mixtures in 48 of 50 states. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5172.46s)]
*  The DEA laboratory system is reporting that in 2022, apparently, approximately, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5178.26s)]
*  rather, 23% of fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5182.9800000000005s)]
*  seized by the DEA contain xylazine. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5187.5s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5191.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5192.02s)]
*  I have a weird, I don't know if obsession is the right word, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5192.54s)]
*  but I like watching drug documentaries and interviews with drug addicts [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5195.9800000000005s)]
*  and DEA agents, all that kind of stuff is just kind of fascinating to me [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5200.5s)]
*  because I don't have a drug problem. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5205.94s)]
*  And it's just interesting to me how people will choose to go down that road [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5207.42s)]
*  over and over and over, even though it just seems like the worst thing ever. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5212.14s)]
*  But the addicts, when they talk about being on fentanyl, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5215.78s)]
*  they'll choose the xylazine now with the fentanyl because it's much better. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5220.34s)]
*  And they know they're going to die from it really soon. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5225.54s)]
*  And they keep choosing it. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5228.02s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5229.42s)]
*  And if you're a heroin addict, you can't even find heroin these days. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5230.74s)]
*  You can't get heroin. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5234.02s)]
*  It's all fentanyl. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5234.900000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5236.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5237.46s)]
*  I've had a few different friends die from fentanyl. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5238.34s)]
*  They thought they were buying a baggie of cocaine and partying [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5242.42s)]
*  and just drop dead. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5246.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5248.06s)]
*  That happened to a group of comedians in LA recently. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5248.900000000001s)]
*  It's so messed up. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5252.62s)]
*  It's fucking horrible. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5253.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5254.38s)]
*  It's the number one killer, I think, of people. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5255.14s)]
*  And it's 18 to 49, something nuts like that. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5257.900000000001s)]
*  It's like 100,000 people a year dying of overdoses. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5261.38s)]
*  What do you think about parents sending test kits with kids [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5265.42s)]
*  to go to parties so they can test the drugs? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5271.06s)]
*  Well, it's certainly better than not testing it and taking it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5273.820000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the best thing would be to don't take any drugs. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5277.18s)]
*  But especially when kids are drinking, you're [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5280.620000000001s)]
*  all your judgment goes out the window. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5285.9400000000005s)]
*  You're not thinking straight. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5287.860000000001s)]
*  You're drunk. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5288.9400000000005s)]
*  And then someone offers Coke, and there's peer pressure. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5289.860000000001s)]
*  And you're like, I'll try it. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5293.14s)]
*  And then next thing you know, you're dead. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5294.46s)]
*  If there was a method of testing, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5296.42s)]
*  and I know they use that a lot at raves, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5299.820000000001s)]
*  because that was one of the issues at raves, [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5302.02s)]
*  was that people were buying MDMA, and that was laced with fentanyl. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5303.900000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5306.9400000000005s)]
*  You don't wind up overdosing with that. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5307.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5308.820000000001s)]
*  That's fucking scary shit, man. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5309.9800000000005s)]
*  Also, parents are sending their kids [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5311.820000000001s)]
*  to Narcon, or Narcan? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5313.7s)]
*  Narcan. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5315.38s)]
*  To help them survive an overdose? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5316.3s)]
*  Well, and to help other people. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5320.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5321.62s)]
*  I heard a lot of kids in Portland [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5322.46s)]
*  are being trained and sending their kids to school with Narcan. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5323.86s)]
*  And they're trained to give Narcan to heroin addicts, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5327.22s)]
*  or to fentanyl addicts, which is crazy. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5330.099999999999s)]
*  That's the other thing they say in those documentaries. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5334.3s)]
*  They always interview the addicts, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5336.42s)]
*  and they say, how many times have you overdosed? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5337.78s)]
*  They say, have you OD'd before? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5339.78s)]
*  And they're all like, yeah, of course. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5341.66s)]
*  And they're, how many times? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5342.86s)]
*  They all say countless. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5343.98s)]
*  They don't know. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5344.86s)]
*  Imagine OD'ing so many times where you literally do not [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5345.86s)]
*  know how many times it's been, and then going straight back [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5349.099999999999s)]
*  and getting high again, like with a needle. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5352.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5354.78s)]
*  It's a real crisis. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5356.9s)]
*  Yeah, it really is a crisis. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5357.98s)]
*  I mean, you have kids. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5359.299999999999s)]
*  I have kids. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5361.299999999999s)]
*  So these are things that are like totally on the front burner [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5361.98s)]
*  for me. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5364.5s)]
*  To me, I'm never sending my kids to a party with test kits. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5365.5s)]
*  I feel like talking to them from a super young age, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5372.98s)]
*  totally having super transparent heart [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5378.459999999999s)]
*  to heart talks with them about friends [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5381.219999999999s)]
*  that I've had that thought they were getting one drug, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5383.5s)]
*  and it was laced with this shit that is completely deadly [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5385.94s)]
*  and dropping dead. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5388.7s)]
*  Just drugs are different, man. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5390.339999999999s)]
*  They're not how it was when we were kids. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5391.62s)]
*  When we were kids, people would experiment. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5393.179999999999s)]
*  It was completely normal. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5394.98s)]
*  I feel like those days are over in some aspects. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5396.259999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5400.179999999999s)]
*  Well, the real problem, and this is a very uncomfortable [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5400.7s)]
*  discussion, but the real problem is that drug prohibition has [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5403.58s)]
*  made criminals the only source of drugs. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5407.66s)]
*  And you have no idea what you're getting. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5411.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5413.26s)]
*  And if you make drugs legal, all drugs legal, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5414.38s)]
*  you're going to have a bunch of people [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5418.46s)]
*  that are doing drugs that wouldn't do drugs [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5420.0199999999995s)]
*  if they were illegal. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5421.9s)]
*  So you have that problem. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5423.0599999999995s)]
*  And so how do you mitigate that? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5424.82s)]
*  How long does it take for the dust settles and life [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5426.54s)]
*  normalizes? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5428.9s)]
*  Because if you think about the prohibition in the United [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5429.66s)]
*  States, prohibition of alcohol in the United States [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5432.86s)]
*  propped up the mob. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5435.0199999999995s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5436.0199999999995s)]
*  It's a fact. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5436.9s)]
*  It's widely openly discussed. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5438.0599999999995s)]
*  The only people that were selling the alcohol [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5439.5s)]
*  were the people that were criminals. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5441.62s)]
*  They made a shitload of money. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5443.12s)]
*  They amassed massive power because of that. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5444.66s)]
*  And they used it. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5448.46s)]
*  They used it to control cities. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5451.42s)]
*  Until they got infiltrated and the mob got broken up, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5453.98s)]
*  for a long time, they reaped the rewards of the power [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5458.98s)]
*  that they started to develop during prohibition. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5462.98s)]
*  And that's exactly what you're seeing with the cartels. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5465.339999999999s)]
*  The reason why the cartels have so much power [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5467.459999999999s)]
*  is because there's so much demand for illegal drugs [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5469.5s)]
*  in the United States. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5471.78s)]
*  And that's not going away. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5472.62s)]
*  Well, it's not going away. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5473.94s)]
*  People have always wanted to do drugs. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5476.0599999999995s)]
*  There's always going to be a certain lost segment [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5477.74s)]
*  of our population that wants to escape reality [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5480.98s)]
*  with some fucking hardcore shit that puts them in a trance. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5483.5s)]
*  Well, they're finding it. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5487.58s)]
*  If they want that, it's everywhere. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5489.1s)]
*  What is Hawaii's problems? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5490.700000000001s)]
*  What is on the Big Island? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5492.820000000001s)]
*  What are their main drug problems? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5494.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's been meth, for the most part, [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5497.14s)]
*  for the last 20 years. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5499.06s)]
*  That's taken a toll. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5500.42s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5501.5s)]
*  Meth has been probably the biggest problem. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5502.740000000001s)]
*  But now it's turning into fentanyl. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5504.620000000001s)]
*  Now it's turning into fentanyl. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5507.5s)]
*  One of the little girls in my daughter's circle of friends [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5509.54s)]
*  was on Instagram Live. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5513.5s)]
*  This was like two years ago. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5514.58s)]
*  This girl was like 12 years old. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5515.9s)]
*  She was on Instagram Live. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5517.54s)]
*  No one was home at her house. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5518.82s)]
*  And she went in her mom's medicine cabinet [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5519.82s)]
*  and she found a little baggie of white powder [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5522.139999999999s)]
*  and chopped it up in a line. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5524.74s)]
*  On Instagram Live, she just had her friends or whatever, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5527.74s)]
*  her 10, 15 friends that follow her, like a little girl, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5530.299999999999s)]
*  and was like, Jeremy? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5533.62s)]
*  And she snorted it. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5534.78s)]
*  It was pure fentanyl. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5535.7s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5536.9s)]
*  And it turns out her mom was selling it. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5538.099999999999s)]
*  That was on the Big Island [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5540.299999999999s)]
*  in my daughter's little circle of friends. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5541.219999999999s)]
*  And she died. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5544.54s)]
*  And it's happening everywhere, man. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5545.900000000001s)]
*  That's my little tiny town that I feel is like a little town, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5547.58s)]
*  like a little farm town that grows coffee. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5550.82s)]
*  And that's where you surf and hang out. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5553.34s)]
*  It's like super mellow. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5555.1s)]
*  But somehow that's really happening. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5555.9400000000005s)]
*  Those drugs have infiltrated [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5559.58s)]
*  every last little corner of our country. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5561.06s)]
*  It's wild, man. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5565.54s)]
*  Wild. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5566.82s)]
*  It is wild. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5567.66s)]
*  And the alternative doesn't seem appealing either. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5568.5s)]
*  The alternative of making heroin and cocaine legal at stores, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5570.9400000000005s)]
*  it's like, I'm gonna make a shit out of me too. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5575.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5597.54s)]
*  Thousands and thousands and thousands of homeless people, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5598.379999999999s)]
*  fentanyl zombies all over these big city blocks, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5601.74s)]
*  like thousands of them slumped over. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5605.54s)]
*  Have you seen that one that gets slumped over? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5608.78s)]
*  That's the trank. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5610.86s)]
*  So that's a tranquilizer thing. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5612.18s)]
*  So they get super high and they're tranquilizer [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5614.54s)]
*  so they basically are like, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5616.62s)]
*  they don't fall but they swing. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5618.46s)]
*  But I feel like in Canada, it's huge. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5622.18s)]
*  In the US, it's huge. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5625.78s)]
*  But I was in France and Spain, none of that. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5627.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5630.62s)]
*  Well, they didn't have the same opioid crisis that we had [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5632.3s)]
*  caused by the Sackler family [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5636.42s)]
*  and what they did with the Oxycontin pills [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5638.38s)]
*  where they just made, who knows how many hundreds [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5640.86s)]
*  of thousands of people addicts in this country. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5644.7s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5647.7s)]
*  If not millions. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5648.54s)]
*  I mean, how many millions of lives are ruined [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5649.66s)]
*  because not just the people that, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5651.62s)]
*  but their families, everything gets devastated. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5654.18s)]
*  Everything gets ruined. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5656.3s)]
*  The most fascinating part I think about that series [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5657.62s)]
*  was, I mean, there were so many fascinating things [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5660.22s)]
*  about that series, but there was a window of time [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5663.06s)]
*  where no one knew what it was, what Oxycontin was. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5666.18s)]
*  No one knew. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5671.9800000000005s)]
*  It just had its name and it made you feel good [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5672.820000000001s)]
*  and it took your pain away and took you out of [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5675.22s)]
*  whatever stress you were feeling. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5677.22s)]
*  Now, now we know about it. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5678.740000000001s)]
*  There's kind of no excuse now for the kids coming up [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5680.9800000000005s)]
*  that are educated, like, hey, opioids, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5684.54s)]
*  they're fucking deadly. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5686.5s)]
*  Oxycontin, all these, like any of these opioids [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5688.14s)]
*  are like highly addictive. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5691.9400000000005s)]
*  They're pretty much all gonna kill you [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5693.42s)]
*  or lead you down this horrible road to something horrible. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5694.58s)]
*  But there was a window of time where literally [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5697.42s)]
*  no one knew what that stuff was. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5699.5s)]
*  I remember it went through my whole, not my whole, [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5700.780000000001s)]
*  but a group of my friends all got hooked on that junk [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5702.900000000001s)]
*  like right away when no one knew what Oxycontin was. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5706.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, that documentary, that series, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5709.5s)]
*  the Netflix series, Painkiller, is absolutely terrifying [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5712.72s)]
*  because it shows you how corrupt the system is [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5715.78s)]
*  and how they were able to prescribe this [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5718.259999999999s)]
*  and make this thing and pass it [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5720.94s)]
*  where it can be prescribed to people. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5722.82s)]
*  Where when we were kids, when I was a kid, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5725.179999999999s)]
*  no one did heroin. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5727.679999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like an issue. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5729.219999999999s)]
*  If someone was doing heroin, that guy's off the rails. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5730.54s)]
*  Like, oh, you hear Mike's doing heroin? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5733.34s)]
*  Just like, Mike's gone. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5735.46s)]
*  You would think that guy's gone. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5736.98s)]
*  Totally. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5738.58s)]
*  He's suicidal. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5739.42s)]
*  He's just fucking shooting up. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5740.24s)]
*  Like I knew a couple of comedians that did heroin [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5742.3s)]
*  and I was like, oh my God. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5744.26s)]
*  And they wind up dying. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5745.3s)]
*  The two that I know that I was pretty aware of, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5746.54s)]
*  they wind up dying from heroin. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5749.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's just, heroin was rare. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5751.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5755.54s)]
*  And then- [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5756.38s)]
*  And a big choice. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5757.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5758.04s)]
*  It was a big choice. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5758.860000000001s)]
*  It was a big choice. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5759.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5760.54s)]
*  But now it's just- [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5761.360000000001s)]
*  And doctors were prescribing it. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5762.2s)]
*  Thousands and thousands and thousands [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5763.34s)]
*  of doctors were prescribing it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5765.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5766.22s)]
*  Because it was believed to be not addictive and safe. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5767.06s)]
*  Yeah, well. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5771.3s)]
*  Where else have we heard that that's safe and effective? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5772.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5774.82s)]
*  Jeez, dude. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5775.66s)]
*  I know we never learned. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5776.48s)]
*  We never learned. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5777.66s)]
*  Well, some people learn. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5778.66s)]
*  But it's so difficult to be completely informed. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5780.099999999999s)]
*  And the problem also is that young people, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5782.78s)]
*  they make bad decisions. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5785.139999999999s)]
*  They're young. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5787.759999999999s)]
*  They don't have a lot of life experience. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5788.599999999999s)]
*  You know? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5790.379999999999s)]
*  And they think they're just gonna party [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5791.2s)]
*  and other people are partying. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5792.379999999999s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5793.7s)]
*  I'll just have fun. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5794.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5795.919999999999s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5796.759999999999s)]
*  And I think that Oxycontin thing was the, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5797.58s)]
*  at least in my lifetime, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5799.7s)]
*  was the first time I started seeing people [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5801.78s)]
*  start to distrust doctors. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5805.0199999999995s)]
*  Do you know what I'm saying? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5808.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5809.62s)]
*  Like, they were starting to look at doctors, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5810.46s)]
*  like especially after those documentaries [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5812.46s)]
*  came out in those docu-series. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5813.94s)]
*  What was the other one called? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5815.0199999999995s)]
*  Dope Sick. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5816.86s)]
*  Dope Sick, yeah. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5817.7s)]
*  Because doctors were like all of a sudden on board [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5818.54s)]
*  with this whole prescription thing [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5821.139999999999s)]
*  and over prescribing like crazy [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5822.66s)]
*  and like buying it hook, line, and sink, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5824.9s)]
*  or whatever those pharma companies were telling them. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5826.54s)]
*  And then that, and then with the whole COVID thing, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5829.84s)]
*  it just accelerated that whole distrust of, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5833.16s)]
*  I feel like that's a really sad thing. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5835.52s)]
*  When I was a kid, you just trusted your doctors implicitly. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5837.72s)]
*  I would call my personal doctor [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5841.360000000001s)]
*  and ask them anything and believe anything they said. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5843.74s)]
*  These days, if I have a broken arm, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5846.64s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the doctor. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5848.6s)]
*  If I have something super specific, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5849.68s)]
*  I'll go to the doctor, but it's crazy. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5852.72s)]
*  I feel like it's different. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5856.4400000000005s)]
*  It's changed now. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5857.4800000000005s)]
*  Doctors are captured by a system [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5858.32s)]
*  and doctors, they're essentially rule followers. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5860.759999999999s)]
*  There's a very rigid system that, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5865.0s)]
*  the FDA forbade them from prescribing ivermectin [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5867.96s)]
*  during COVID, which is wild. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5872.46s)]
*  Wild. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5874.599999999999s)]
*  Because now it's legal to prescribe. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5875.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5876.32s)]
*  Just like now they allowed it to prescribe [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5877.16s)]
*  and there's, I don't know who's right or who's wrong, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5879.24s)]
*  but there's a lot of randomized controlled trials [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5881.599999999999s)]
*  that show that it's effective. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5883.4s)]
*  So like, what the fuck is that all about? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5885.099999999999s)]
*  Like, what did they do? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5886.96s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what they did. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5887.84s)]
*  There was a cheap and effective drug that is generic, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5888.88s)]
*  so they can't make any money off of it. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5894.400000000001s)]
*  And then there's this other thing [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5896.08s)]
*  that they can make billions of dollars off. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5897.320000000001s)]
*  So they pushed that. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5898.92s)]
*  And anyone that supported that cheap and effective drug, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5900.0s)]
*  they were marginalized. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5903.96s)]
*  They were mocked. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5905.04s)]
*  The media was involved in it [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5908.16s)]
*  because of the amount of money [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5910.400000000001s)]
*  that these pharmaceutical drug companies spend [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5911.54s)]
*  on media advertisement. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5914.72s)]
*  That's the giant problem. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5916.08s)]
*  So crazy. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5917.76s)]
*  There's only two countries in the whole world [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5918.68s)]
*  that allow pharmaceutical drug companies [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5920.5599999999995s)]
*  to advertise on TV. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5922.22s)]
*  And that's the United States and New Zealand. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5923.48s)]
*  And New Zealand is much more restrictive [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5925.84s)]
*  than the United States is. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5927.48s)]
*  And the most fucked up thing is not only [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5929.2s)]
*  are they able to advertise in the US, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5931.68s)]
*  they're able to advertise on our news channels. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5934.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5938.5199999999995s)]
*  They're able to prop up our whole media system. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5939.36s)]
*  Yeah, and then the media can't say anything [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5941.2s)]
*  about pharmaceutical drug side effects. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5944.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5946.44s)]
*  I mean, they're captured. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5947.28s)]
*  So crazy. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5948.28s)]
*  But that's also led to their demise. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5949.12s)]
*  They looked at short term profits [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5952.04s)]
*  over long term sustainability [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5953.76s)]
*  because the trust in mainstream media is at an all time low. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5955.88s)]
*  COVID ruined their trust. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5960.24s)]
*  CNN recently got the lowest ratings it's had since 1991. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5963.0s)]
*  They got 43,000 people [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5966.96s)]
*  watching one of those Anderson Cooper shows. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5969.639999999999s)]
*  I heard that. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5971.32s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5972.139999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5972.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5974.38s)]
*  Whitney Cummings said that she goes, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5975.62s)]
*  if I had 43,000 people that watched my Instagram, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5977.0199999999995s)]
*  real I'd kill myself. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5979.219999999999s)]
*  That's insane, right? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5980.86s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5982.179999999999s)]
*  It's crazy that people with large personal platforms [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5983.78s)]
*  are bigger than mainstream media. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5986.78s)]
*  Way bigger. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5988.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5989.46s)]
*  Way bigger. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5990.28s)]
*  And amazing, it's good. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5991.12s)]
*  It is amazing. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5991.96s)]
*  It's a good thing. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5992.78s)]
*  I mean, look at MrBeast. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5993.62s)]
*  What does he have like 100 million YouTube subscribers? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5994.54s)]
*  There's not a show on earth that's like that. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5997.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=5999.58s)]
*  Not a show on earth that's bigger than that. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6000.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6001.599999999999s)]
*  But yeah, I feel like you're right. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6002.58s)]
*  It's definitely never been worse. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6003.9s)]
*  I think that- [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6006.66s)]
*  They did it to themselves. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6008.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6009.26s)]
*  I mean, they all did it to themselves. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6010.1s)]
*  I mean, and they do it to themselves constantly. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6011.94s)]
*  They did it to themselves with this Hamas Israel invasion, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6014.5s)]
*  with the bombing of the hospital, all that stuff. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6019.0199999999995s)]
*  The narrative- [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6021.42s)]
*  You can see they're elated to tell the news right now. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6022.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6026.82s)]
*  They seem like they're so excited [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6027.7s)]
*  that they have something that people are just like [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6030.0199999999995s)]
*  locked onto. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6031.54s)]
*  They're the only ones who win in these wars, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6033.1s)]
*  those media companies. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6035.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's kind of ironic [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6036.26s)]
*  that that's literally how they made Trump [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6038.54s)]
*  by constantly reporting on the stupid things [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6041.3s)]
*  that he would say and the ridiculous things that he would say. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6043.26s)]
*  They would think they were getting him, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6046.18s)]
*  but all they were doing was giving him more attention. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6048.14s)]
*  And all they were doing was making him bigger, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6050.62s)]
*  making his profile bigger. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6052.1s)]
*  And every time they attacked him, he just got bigger. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6053.22s)]
*  And now that people have a distrust in media, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6055.38s)]
*  now it works even the opposite way. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6057.5s)]
*  It's even more ridiculous, rather. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6059.62s)]
*  No one trusts them anymore. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6062.58s)]
*  So anytime they say anything, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6063.86s)]
*  people go, what's really going on? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6065.26s)]
*  This is kind of off topic, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6067.9s)]
*  but I meant to ask you about this. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6069.18s)]
*  Isn't it funny that you are painted as a right-winger? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6071.14s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6077.58s)]
*  And I don't think you're a left-winger. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6079.46s)]
*  I don't think you're a right-winger. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6080.78s)]
*  I don't even know. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6081.74s)]
*  Way more left-wing than I'm right-wing. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6082.86s)]
*  But it's funny that if you ask, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6084.62s)]
*  the whole left basically thinks you're right. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6090.3s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6092.22s)]
*  Anybody who's semi-progressive or whatever [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6093.42s)]
*  would think that you are a right-winger, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6096.42s)]
*  because that's how they depict you in the news, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6098.9s)]
*  on the left, like CNN and all that stuff. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6101.46s)]
*  Well, also I look like I would be a right-winger. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6103.94s)]
*  I'm bald, I have muscles, tattoos, I bow hunt, [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6106.54s)]
*  and I do cage fighting commentary. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6109.14s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons why you could label me. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6112.34s)]
*  You fit the stereotype. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6115.0199999999995s)]
*  But how many presidential candidates [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6117.22s)]
*  have you had on this show? [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6122.740000000001s)]
*  Quite a few. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6124.02s)]
*  Okay, let's name them. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6125.3s)]
*  Bernie Sanders? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6126.14s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, Andrew Yang, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6126.96s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Gary Johnson. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6129.900000000001s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6136.26s)]
*  Is that everybody? [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6137.780000000001s)]
*  Well, RFK, Tulsi, and Bernie, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6138.66s)]
*  what they have in common- [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6142.1s)]
*  Gary Johnson's a libertarian. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6142.9400000000005s)]
*  They're Democrats. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6144.46s)]
*  They're all Democrats. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6145.3s)]
*  I just think it's kind of funny that everybody, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6147.219999999999s)]
*  all these people think you're right-winger. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6148.94s)]
*  I haven't had a single Republican candidate [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6150.3s)]
*  for governor, for president, for anything. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6152.38s)]
*  But I've never heard that you're biased [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6157.46s)]
*  from not having Republicans on your show. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6161.219999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6164.78s)]
*  That's kind of weird they leave that out. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6165.62s)]
*  Well, it's just the mainstream media. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6166.9s)]
*  They don't like other people having influence, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6169.38s)]
*  and they try to attack them. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6172.98s)]
*  One of the best ways to marginalize someone [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6174.38s)]
*  or use it as a pejorative is call them far right. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6176.14s)]
*  They like to call me far right. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6179.34s)]
*  Well, the only thing that I'm right-wing about [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6181.46s)]

*  when it comes to school shootings. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6304.52s)]

*  and that's what caused them to do that? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6334.32s)]
*  Perhaps. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6335.84s)]
*  Is it because a lot of these disassociatives [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6336.759999999999s)]
*  and a lot of these SSRIs, a lot of these different things, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6340.04s)]

*  There has to be some sort of a connection. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6348.36s)]

*  specifically to protect their interest, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6364.0s)]

*  by the pharmaceutical drug companies. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6368.92s)]

*  including the people that run [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6372.64s)]

*  when people have mental health issues [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6500.040000000001s)]
*  and they go and seek help, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6501.360000000001s)]
*  a lot of times they get put on drugs immediately. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6502.52s)]
*  And nowadays there's a lot of other options. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6505.400000000001s)]
*  There's brain treatment, there's hallucinogenics [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6508.0s)]
*  that they're doing. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6510.64s)]
*  There's a lot of different options now, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6511.76s)]
*  and I feel like the pharmaceutical option [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6513.160000000001s)]
*  should be maybe the last option in some situations. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6518.28s)]
*  Right, yeah, in many, many situations. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6522.04s)]
*  And in some situations it's a good option, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6524.44s)]
*  and that needs to be addressed too. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6526.16s)]
*  It's not binary. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6527.4s)]
*  There's some people that I'm friends with [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6529.0s)]
*  that got on antidepressants and it changed their life, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6531.4s)]
*  got them out of a funk and allowed them to make changes, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6534.92s)]
*  and then slowly weaned out. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6538.36s)]
*  My friend Ari, he got on them [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6539.68s)]
*  and then eventually got off of them. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6541.639999999999s)]
*  And he changed his life. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6543.639999999999s)]
*  He got much more successful and happy, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6545.72s)]
*  and then realized like, okay, now I'm happy, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6548.52s)]
*  now I'm successful. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6550.64s)]
*  I need to get myself off of this stuff [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6551.76s)]
*  and stayed happy and stayed successful. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6553.4400000000005s)]
*  It's interesting when you start making different, [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6556.360000000001s)]
*  like when you get your brain pretty good, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6558.200000000001s)]
*  then you start making different life choices. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6560.64s)]
*  You get healthier all around [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6562.08s)]
*  and maybe successful in your work, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6563.68s)]
*  and you start having like meaningful relationships [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6565.52s)]
*  with people. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6567.52s)]
*  It helps heal your brain. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6568.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6570.68s)]
*  It helps heal your perspective as well. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6571.52s)]
*  It can make a significant difference. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6573.44s)]
*  How you view life. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6574.599999999999s)]
*  But that's a big one with psychedelics. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6576.4s)]
*  But the problem with psychedelics [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6578.12s)]
*  is they're not profitable. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6579.16s)]
*  And you go to Peru and fucking take a brew in the jungle [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6580.599999999999s)]
*  that they make out of leaves, and it fixes your life. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6583.599999999999s)]
*  Not a lot of money in that. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6587.5599999999995s)]
*  And you definitely don't get people addicted to it. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6589.2s)]
*  I think it's starting to emerge though [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6591.719999999999s)]
*  in some of these clinics [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6593.36s)]
*  that are like alternative mental health type of places. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6594.2s)]
*  I've been doing, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6598.719999999999s)]
*  but I think I talked to you about this in the past, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6599.5599999999995s)]
*  but I've been doing a bit of brain treatment. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6601.56s)]
*  So years ago when I was surfing a lot of really big waves, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6606.52s)]
*  I had kind of a cluster of concussions. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6610.200000000001s)]
*  Over a six year period, I had five really bad concussions. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6613.120000000001s)]
*  They were all pretty close to each other, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6616.240000000001s)]
*  and a couple of them were really, really bad. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6617.68s)]
*  Anyway, I started noticing some mental health issues. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6619.72s)]
*  Not super bad and not extreme, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6624.56s)]
*  but it was starting to creep in. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6626.360000000001s)]
*  My mood started going downhill. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6629.4400000000005s)]
*  I was kind of getting more and more pessimistic. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6631.8s)]
*  Didn't like being around people even more so. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6634.88s)]
*  And I'm not the most social person, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6637.2s)]
*  but I started having anxiety about going in big groups, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6639.76s)]
*  hanging out with big groups of people, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6644.76s)]
*  going to public functions, stuff like that. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6646.36s)]
*  It would really freak me out. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6648.28s)]
*  Now I was also getting pretty mentally sloppy, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6650.48s)]
*  a lot of brain fog. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6653.4s)]
*  My mental clarity was getting worse and worse. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6654.64s)]
*  It was getting super forgetful. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6657.44s)]
*  Anyway, I met a guy who has a brain treatment center [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6659.8s)]
*  in California. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6663.16s)]
*  So I went and got an EEG it's called. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6664.16s)]
*  So they measure your brain function, your brain activity. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6666.12s)]
*  And they get all this data about your brain. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6669.88s)]
*  And then I had some brain treatment. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6672.0s)]
*  And then they sent me a, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6673.68s)]
*  I got this at home brain treatment machine. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6676.0s)]
*  Basically I put this thing on my head in the mornings. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6682.96s)]
*  And- Is it magnetic? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6685.68s)]
*  For 30 minutes. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6686.6s)]
*  Yeah, it has electrical pulses that goes through [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6687.76s)]
*  and into your brain and stimulates brain activity. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6692.08s)]
*  Anyway, I hadn't had my EEG done in a long, long time. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6695.72s)]
*  And I was just in California. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6699.72s)]
*  And I was really curious because I can, [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6700.96s)]
*  so my machine at home is programmed, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6703.240000000001s)]
*  its protocol is just for my brain, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6707.76s)]
*  specifically for my brain based off my EEG. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6709.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I wanted to get a new EEG updated [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6713.04s)]
*  so I can update my protocol at home [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6715.280000000001s)]
*  so it works on my brain how it is now [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6718.16s)]
*  instead of how it was two years ago. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6719.04s)]
*  I didn't know if there was a difference or not. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6721.2s)]
*  So I got an EEG the other day, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6722.599999999999s)]
*  talked to the neuroscience for like half an hour [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6724.04s)]
*  on a Zoom call. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6726.2s)]
*  He walked me through my chart for my EEG [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6727.16s)]
*  two years ago, my chart now. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6729.719999999999s)]
*  And he's like, what have you been doing? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6731.759999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I've had some, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6733.4s)]
*  I have a machine at home doing my brain treatment, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6735.0s)]
*  but I'm never home. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6737.879999999999s)]
*  I don't do that much. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6738.719999999999s)]
*  And he was like, what is there anything else [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6739.839999999999s)]
*  that could like make your brain better? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6741.32s)]
*  Because we're seeing significant improvements [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6744.16s)]
*  in your brain function. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6746.4s)]
*  It is wild. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6748.12s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6749.44s)]
*  And I've noticed it. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6750.28s)]
*  I've noticed like more mental clarity, better mood. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6751.5599999999995s)]
*  And I've done a couple of different things. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6754.5599999999995s)]
*  I told him about the stem cell treatment, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6756.24s)]
*  but it was right before that. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6758.0s)]
*  So I don't think that there was like a correlation [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6759.5199999999995s)]
*  between my current stem cell treatment and this EEG. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6762.16s)]
*  And he's like, what else have you been doing? [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6766.28s)]
*  And I told him, I started TRT just over a year ago. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6767.839999999999s)]
*  And after I started TRT, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6772.599999999999s)]
*  I felt a significant improvement in my mood [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6774.96s)]
*  and my mental clarity and my energy. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6778.96s)]
*  Well, that is one of the things that happens [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6780.96s)]
*  with concussions, especially multiple concussions, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6782.52s)]
*  is it damages your endocrine system, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6786.2s)]
*  damages the pituitary gland, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6788.44s)]
*  which is apparently very sensitive. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6789.84s)]
*  And my good friend, Dr. Mark Gordon, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6791.24s)]
*  who's done a lot of work on traumatic brain injuries [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6793.92s)]
*  with veterans and with football players and fighters, [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6796.24s)]
*  they found that a significant number of them suffer [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6799.28s)]
*  from low testosterone and low hormones [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6802.16s)]
*  because their brain is just not producing them correctly [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6805.08s)]
*  anymore because it's been damaged. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6807.5199999999995s)]
*  And by replenishing those with testosterone [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6809.12s)]
*  replacement therapy and hormone replacement therapy, [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6811.12s)]
*  they've alleviated a lot of the problems [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6813.72s)]
*  that people had, suicidal ideation, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6816.12s)]
*  a lot of significant depression issues [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6819.08s)]
*  that they've been able to mitigate [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6822.08s)]
*  with hormone replacement. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6824.0s)]
*  It's amazing though that we have, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6825.24s)]
*  like there's that's even an option these days. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6826.36s)]
*  It's incredible. Incredible. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6828.16s)]
*  Well, we're in the right time. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6829.24s)]
*  With stem cells, with TRT, with hormone replacement, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6830.6s)]
*  with the understanding of nutrition [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6833.4400000000005s)]
*  and with this brain machine that you're using, [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6835.160000000001s)]
*  these treatments, we're in a good time for that. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6837.56s)]
*  We're very, very fortunate. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6840.280000000001s)]
*  I'm thankful. I'm grateful for all of that. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6841.400000000001s)]
*  Dude, if we lived in the fifties, we'd be fucked. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6842.72s)]
*  Just think about your knee surgery. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6844.4800000000005s)]
*  Like my good friend, Steve Graham, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6846.4400000000005s)]
*  he was on the US ski team in the 1980s. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6848.4800000000005s)]
*  And he had, I mean, he's had some fucking, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6851.280000000001s)]
*  I don't want to butcher this. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6855.280000000001s)]
*  I think he's had 70 surgeries over his whole life. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6856.68s)]
*  He's had his shoulders replaced. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6860.04s)]
*  He's got two artificial knees, like everything. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6861.24s)]
*  But his legs, like the sides of his legs [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6863.68s)]
*  are just covered in scars from these old school surgeries [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6867.08s)]
*  where they would open you up like a fish [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6871.32s)]
*  and take a chunk of your hamstring [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6873.24s)]
*  and fucking drill it in place. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6874.76s)]
*  And it would last for a little while and blow out. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6876.24s)]
*  You have to go in and do it again. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6878.44s)]
*  Modern medicine's insane. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6881.24s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6882.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. How precise and like, it's so predictable. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6883.36s)]
*  They know it's going to work. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6886.36s)]
*  Like my surgeon for my knee was like, [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6887.32s)]
*  dude, you're like tripping on this for no reason, Shane. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6889.48s)]
*  Like don't be a bitch. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6892.88s)]
*  It's, you know what I mean? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6894.16s)]
*  I do this every single day, multiple times a day. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6896.0s)]
*  Your knee's going to be amazing. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6898.96s)]
*  Like 50 years ago, like you said, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6900.48s)]
*  it would have changed my life. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6903.0s)]
*  I never would have surfed the same ever again. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6904.04s)]
*  I could surf at a really high level still. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6906.16s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6908.32s)]
*  We're very, very, very lucky to be living [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6909.16s)]
*  in the time we're living in, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6911.08s)]
*  even though there's a lot of problems. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6912.28s)]
*  When I lived in Boston in 19, I guess it was 1980, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6913.599999999999s)]
*  86, I was 19 and I was working [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6920.04s)]
*  at the Boston Athletic Club. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6924.12s)]
*  It was the healthcare club in South Boston. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6925.88s)]
*  And I was a trainer, like showing people [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6928.88s)]
*  how to use machines and stuff like that [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6930.5599999999995s)]
*  and putting people through workouts. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6931.92s)]
*  And Bobby Orr, the famous hockey player was there. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6933.32s)]
*  Bobby Orr's knees were so bad [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6937.2s)]
*  because he had so many surgeries [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6939.28s)]
*  that he couldn't straighten his legs out. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6941.08s)]
*  His knees were always bent [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6943.0s)]
*  and he would walk with this kind of like robotic shuffle. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6944.4s)]
*  And we used to have to help him [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6947.12s)]
*  get on the VersaClimber machine. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6948.44s)]
*  He literally couldn't get on it by himself. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6950.44s)]
*  I mean, this is like one of the greatest hockey players [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6952.36s)]
*  of all time. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6954.16s)]
*  And his knees were so destroyed [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6955.0s)]
*  and he had these knee braces he would wear, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6957.16s)]
*  but he would play racquetball [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6958.5599999999995s)]
*  and he would like go for a ball and just fall down. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6959.96s)]
*  He just like couldn't stand up. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6961.96s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6963.24s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6964.24s)]
*  Imagine that guy had stem cells. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6965.08s)]
*  Yeah, or like modern surgery. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6966.16s)]
*  Yeah, modern surgery. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6968.48s)]
*  If they had modern knee reconstruction [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6969.48s)]
*  like they have today, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6971.68s)]
*  where they put a cadaver graft in there, they fix it. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6972.92s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6975.96s)]
*  They're even able to do cadaver meniscus now, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6977.4800000000005s)]
*  which is crazy. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6980.16s)]
*  Like I'm missing meniscus on my left knee. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6981.28s)]
*  I had a pretty significant tear of my left meniscus. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6983.24s)]
*  So they took a, it was like called a bucket handle tear [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6986.12s)]
*  where I had the ACL reconstructed in 94, I think. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6988.68s)]
*  And then in 2003, I believe, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6993.6s)]
*  they scooped out the meniscus [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6997.24s)]
*  because it was just, they tried to sew it back together, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=6999.320000000001s)]
*  but it kept tearing and then it would lock up. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7001.56s)]
*  A bucket handle tear is just weird. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7004.6s)]
*  So it folds over and locks in place. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7007.08s)]
*  My knee would lock and it's agonizing. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7009.32s)]
*  So the only way that they fixed that [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7012.12s)]
*  is they would just cut out the meniscus. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7013.639999999999s)]
*  So now I'm missing a chunk of meniscus. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7015.679999999999s)]
*  So the knee is kind of compromised. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7018.599999999999s)]
*  It's like a little wobbly and every now and then it swells, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7019.96s)]
*  but at least it's functional. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7022.36s)]
*  Like I can deal with a little discomfort [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7024.28s)]
*  if my knee is functional. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7025.84s)]
*  So the knee, the structure of the knee is very solid. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7028.0s)]
*  It's very strong. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7030.44s)]
*  I could do all kinds of things. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7031.36s)]
*  When I hike through the mountains, I can kick the bag. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7032.5199999999995s)]
*  But I have to deal with a little bit of pain and discomfort. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7035.24s)]
*  But now they're able to, they can do graphs [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7037.76s)]
*  where they'll take meniscus, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7041.5199999999995s)]
*  but it's generally only effective for people [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7042.88s)]
*  that are like 40 and under. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7045.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's the age. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7047.48s)]
*  I think as you get older, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7048.719999999999s)]
*  it becomes more and more of a problem with blood flow. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7049.88s)]
*  I don't know if that's the same with everyone. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7053.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if that's the same with me [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7055.28s)]
*  as a person, someone who's sedentary. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7056.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7058.8s)]
*  I don't understand why I would have less blood flow [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7059.639999999999s)]
*  as much as I exercise in comparison to a person [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7062.32s)]
*  who's like 20 years old and sedentary [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7064.76s)]
*  with hormone replacement, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7067.280000000001s)]
*  with all the other things that I do, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7068.52s)]
*  supplements, all the different things that I do, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7070.320000000001s)]
*  peptides. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7072.04s)]
*  Yeah, the way you live, your diet. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7072.88s)]
*  Yeah, the diet, regular sauna use, cold punches, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7074.280000000001s)]
*  so many things that I do that keep my body healthy. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7078.360000000001s)]
*  Your health picture probably looks pretty similar [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7081.0s)]
*  to somebody like in their 30s or something [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7082.88s)]
*  when you look at, if you look at your overall health. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7084.64s)]
*  Well, I know for a fact the way my body functions, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7086.64s)]
*  it's very similar. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7089.64s)]
*  Because the other day I did eight rounds on the bag [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7091.24s)]
*  and I was thinking, I don't even think of the fact [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7095.2s)]
*  that I'm 56. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7098.44s)]
*  I just think of techniques. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7100.04s)]
*  I'm just thinking of, boom, boom, wham. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7101.36s)]
*  I'm not thinking of, oh my God, I'm 56, be careful. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7103.16s)]
*  All I'm thinking of is just fucking, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7108.08s)]
*  30 seconds left, push, boom, boom, boom, wham, [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7110.679999999999s)]
*  boom, boom, wham. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7113.24s)]
*  I'm not thinking about it. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7114.36s)]
*  It's amazing to not have to worry about your body. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7115.36s)]
*  To be careful, be smart, train hard, exercise hard, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7119.36s)]
*  recover hard, nutrition, supplements, all that jazz. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7123.24s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7125.799999999999s)]
*  I have a very functional body at 56. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7127.28s)]
*  When I was a kid, I thought you were dead when you were 56. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7129.5599999999995s)]
*  I didn't think you could be jacked and strong and healthy [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7132.839999999999s)]
*  and have all this energy and do two shows a night [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7135.92s)]
*  at the comedy club and do five podcasts a week [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7138.44s)]
*  and do all the other shit that I do in life [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7140.599999999999s)]
*  and feel great. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7142.759999999999s)]
*  I feel fucking great. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7144.24s)]
*  Guys in their 50s are functioning [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7145.759999999999s)]
*  at a super high level now. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7147.32s)]
*  It's just awesome, amazing. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7150.0s)]
*  And the coolest thing about it is, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7150.84s)]
*  if you talk to Andrew Huberman, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7152.96s)]
*  the stuff that he talks about, it's not a rich guy thing. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7155.12s)]
*  It's really not. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7159.0s)]
*  A lot of people assume it is, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7159.84s)]
*  but waking up in the morning [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7161.8s)]
*  and getting sunlight right away, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7164.68s)]
*  training, food, running a little bit, sleeping good, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7167.0s)]
*  that's all stuff that you can do, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7172.0s)]
*  even if you don't have a lot of, [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7173.32s)]
*  you don't have to be super wealthy. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7176.48s)]
*  And even the hormone replacement thing, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7178.52s)]
*  if you're 50 years old or older or whatever, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7181.56s)]
*  even that is super inexpensive, relatively speaking. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7184.8s)]
*  Testosterone is super inexpensive. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7186.92s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know that. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7188.120000000001s)]
*  When I was younger, I had no idea. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7189.360000000001s)]
*  Especially when you consider [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7190.52s)]
*  how much money people spend on booze. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7191.76s)]
*  If you go to a bar and you drink for a night, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7194.040000000001s)]
*  you're fucking spending hundreds of dollars on drinks. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7196.6s)]
*  That's your whole, that's months of hormone replacement. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7199.200000000001s)]
*  One night at the bar. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7202.96s)]
*  And my testosterone is interesting [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7204.280000000001s)]
*  because I wasn't really low. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7206.8s)]
*  Denise is my doctor. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7210.2s)]
*  And I did my blood work and we looked at everything. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7211.64s)]
*  And mine wasn't really low for my age. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7214.96s)]
*  I didn't really look into it [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7217.04s)]
*  until I was right before 50 years old for those listening. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7218.08s)]
*  And I don't really think you should [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7221.6s)]
*  until you get a lot older. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7222.8s)]
*  But I was at a pretty good level, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7226.400000000001s)]
*  but I wasn't in an optimal level. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7228.72s)]
*  And she's like, you should probably [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7230.400000000001s)]
*  just try it to see how you feel. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7232.56s)]
*  See how you feel. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7234.52s)]
*  There's no downside to trying it. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7235.36s)]
*  So it's like I do a cream. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7236.839999999999s)]
*  Cream on the nuts before I go to sleep. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7239.839999999999s)]
*  Super simple. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7241.679999999999s)]
*  It's like a little clicker. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7242.679999999999s)]
*  Click, click, click. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7243.5199999999995s)]
*  And then I also supplement vitamin D, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7244.36s)]
*  which is a hormone. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7246.96s)]
*  And I supplement DHEA, which is a hormone. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7247.839999999999s)]
*  A hormone, DHEA is, I believe it is, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7251.24s)]
*  it's from the thyroid. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7255.719999999999s)]
*  Is it thyroid? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7261.12s)]
*  No, not thyroid. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7261.96s)]
*  Thyroid. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7262.799999999999s)]
*  Can you look it up, Jamie? [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7264.04s)]
*  DHEA is from the adrenal gland. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7265.64s)]
*  And I think that's where your testosterone [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7268.68s)]
*  and estrogen are created. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7271.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so I take those three. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7275.64s)]
*  DHEA, testosterone. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7278.72s)]
*  I take those as well, as well as peptides. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7280.36s)]
*  I take peptides that stimulate your body's production [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7283.2s)]
*  of human growth hormone, IGF, and then BPC157, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7286.04s)]
*  which is really good for recovering [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7290.5199999999995s)]
*  from soft tissue injuries. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7291.88s)]
*  And that stuff is amazing. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7293.8s)]
*  Yeah, I did that with my knee for six months. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7295.6s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7297.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7298.4400000000005s)]
*  There's so many different things that they know now [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7299.28s)]
*  that work. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7300.76s)]
*  And like I said, we're super, super fortunate [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7301.8s)]
*  to be at this time. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7304.72s)]
*  I've had doctors tell me that the BPC157, [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7305.6s)]
*  that there's no scientific data to back it up [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7309.32s)]
*  and that it's hocus pocus. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7311.72s)]
*  And every single high level athlete that I know [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7313.28s)]
*  when they get injured, they get on BPC157. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7316.08s)]
*  Yeah, those doctors are crack. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7319.08s)]
*  They're cracked because it's not true. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7321.5199999999995s)]
*  There's plenty of studies. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7323.32s)]
*  Like I've had conversations with doctors like, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7325.44s)]
*  oh, well, saline works just as effectively. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7327.32s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7329.8s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7330.64s)]
*  You're not an athlete. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7331.48s)]
*  Look at you, you fat fuck. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7332.92s)]
*  Like you're telling me. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7334.16s)]
*  Well, there's a reason when someone in the NBA [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7335.16s)]
*  or in the UFC, they get injured. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7337.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7340.84s)]
*  Well, that was one of the issues with the UFC and USADA [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7341.68s)]
*  was I talked to Jeff Novitsky about this, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7346.8s)]
*  who was the head of the UFC's anti-drug program. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7348.88s)]
*  And what he was saying is like, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7352.28s)]
*  USADA won't allow these athletes to take BPC157. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7353.68s)]
*  He thinks that's wrong. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7357.16s)]
*  He's like, you've got to give them the opportunity [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7358.0s)]
*  to recover from injuries. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7359.72s)]
*  And it's not a drug, it's an amino acid stack, right? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7360.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7363.0s)]
*  It's a peptide and it helps your body heal. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7363.92s)]
*  And it really works. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7366.36s)]
*  And there are studies on it. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7367.6s)]
*  I mean, when we talk to someone like Andrew Huberman, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7369.12s)]
*  he's very high on that stuff. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7371.64s)]
*  And he's about as legit as you can get. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7372.92s)]
*  Yeah, and he cites only data and current data. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7375.08s)]
*  He's up on the latest. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7377.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7379.56s)]
*  Thank God there's people like him out there. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7380.400000000001s)]
*  Thank God. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7381.68s)]
*  Amazing that we have that as a resource for free on YouTube. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7382.52s)]
*  Jack Scientist. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7386.400000000001s)]
*  That's what we want. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7387.88s)]
*  Look at that dude. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7388.72s)]
*  He looks like he should be fighting in the UFC. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7389.56s)]
*  And he's not selling anything. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7391.12s)]
*  He's just like a fricking neuroscientist, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7392.4800000000005s)]
*  scientist, health professional. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7395.0s)]
*  And he's just strictly going on data. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7397.72s)]
*  It's not his feelings. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7399.360000000001s)]
*  He's very careful about not being associated [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7400.2s)]
*  with anything in terms of like [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7404.2s)]
*  what can compromise his integrity. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7405.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, good on him. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7407.04s)]
*  It's so important to have people like him out there. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7409.400000000001s)]
*  Peter Attia is amazing as well. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7411.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's a good friend of mine. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7412.68s)]

*  at one point in time. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7442.92s)]
*  The doctor thought that I was on anti-cholesterol [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7443.74s)]
*  or low cholesterol medication. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7445.68s)]

*  I just not, dietary cholesterol [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7448.68s)]
*  is not really what the issue is. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7450.6s)]
*  I mean, I'm the wrong person to talk about this, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7453.0s)]
*  but obviously there's people that are, [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7455.78s)]
*  they have genetic issues. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7461.46s)]

*  It really, I think it depends entirely on the individual, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7472.96s)]
*  but I do not think that the food that's eaten [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7475.92s)]
*  by 95% of the people in the world is the problem, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7479.16s)]
*  which is meat. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7482.3s)]
*  The most nutrient dense food in the world. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7483.14s)]
*  Well, the processed food is the problem. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7485.54s)]
*  Processed food. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7487.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7487.88s)]
*  Processed food, overabundance of calorie rich, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7488.7s)]
*  simple carbohydrates that people consume on a regular basis [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7492.400000000001s)]
*  like fructose corn syrup, all that shit. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7496.400000000001s)]
*  All that shit is terrible for you. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7498.0s)]
*  And that's the problem with these epidemiology studies [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7499.76s)]
*  is that when they ask a person, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7502.860000000001s)]
*  like how many days a week do you eat meat? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7504.4800000000005s)]
*  And you say, well, look, if you show the people [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7506.400000000001s)]
*  that are eating meat five days a week, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7508.320000000001s)]
*  there's a higher instances of cancer. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7510.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but let's break down what else they do. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7513.200000000001s)]
*  How many of those people are drinking every night? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7515.080000000001s)]
*  How many of those people are smoking cigarettes? [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7516.6s)]

*  How many, what is that, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7521.68s)]
*  what's the form that meat comes in? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7523.58s)]
*  Does it come in a Burger King Whopper [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7525.9s)]
*  or is it from grass fed steak and broccoli? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7528.14s)]
*  Big difference. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7531.7s)]

*  Big fucking difference. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7534.9s)]
*  There's just so many factors that lead, [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7535.82s)]
*  and all I know, I'm not telling you how to live, [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7538.18s)]
*  I'm not telling anybody else. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7540.18s)]
*  All I know is how I live is the best way for me. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7541.26s)]
*  I have never had better results than the way I eat. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7544.46s)]

*  There's a lot of people that eat the way I eat now. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7549.0599999999995s)]
*  And it seems counterintuitive [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7551.08s)]
*  based on conventional medical advice, [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7552.96s)]
*  but I'm all in, you know, and I feel fucking great. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7556.24s)]

*  of your life, like brushing your teeth, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7612.38s)]

*  that they were being healthier than actual butter, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7686.78s)]
*  which is actually good for you. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7688.719999999999s)]

*  And he said, if someone told me [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7708.42s)]
*  that they wanted to get diabetes as fast as possible, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7711.0199999999995s)]

*  It's changing their gut biome. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7732.38s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7767.38s)]
*  The second I'm done, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7768.26s)]
*  I get like a little bit of sugar cravings [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7769.66s)]
*  and I'll like walking by my freezer and I'll be like, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7771.66s)]
*  Ice cream. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7774.54s)]

*  I'll put like whey protein in the acai [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7781.34s)]
*  and I'll blend that up and I'll put it in a bowl [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7783.54s)]
*  with granola, berries, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7785.62s)]
*  bananas, honey and peanut butter on top. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7789.34s)]
*  Sounds really good, but it's like pure sugar and it's huge. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7794.18s)]
*  And it's just like a sugar. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7797.14s)]
*  I'm not hungry at all. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7799.5s)]
*  It's just a sugar craving, but it's powerful. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7800.7s)]
*  Yeah, you can over consume because of sugar so easily. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7803.02s)]
*  Very easily. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7806.5s)]
*  So easily. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7807.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's my biggest vice. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7808.18s)]
*  You have no vices? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7809.94s)]
*  What are your vices? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7810.9s)]
*  Oh, food. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7811.74s)]
*  No cigars, I guess is a vice, but food. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7814.34s)]
*  Food. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7815.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, my biggest, look I'm- [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7816.82s)]
*  Not right now. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7818.06s)]
*  No, well I just cut it off, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7819.02s)]
*  but if I let myself go, it's pasta, it's lasagna, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7821.5s)]
*  linguini. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7827.38s)]
*  The Italian vibes. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7828.22s)]
*  Yeah, Italian vibes. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7829.34s)]
*  I'll go hard. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7831.18s)]
*  But then there's also like the difference [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7832.46s)]
*  between the pasta that we get over here [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7834.46s)]
*  and the pasta in Europe. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7835.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7836.86s)]
*  When they use that heirloom wheat, they use ancient grains. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7837.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like they're not fucked with [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7841.18s)]
*  the way that we fuck with them over here. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7843.46s)]
*  When they increase the yield per acre. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7844.379999999999s)]
*  So they change what the grains are [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7847.58s)]
*  and more complex glutens, it's harder for your body [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7850.139999999999s)]
*  to process, it creates more inflammation. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7853.94s)]
*  And it's covered in glyphosate. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7855.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's another big one. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7857.0199999999995s)]
*  That's another big one that no one wants to investigate. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7859.0599999999995s)]
*  That scares the shit out of people. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7861.299999999999s)]
*  And there's so many apologists that are tied [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7863.219999999999s)]
*  to the fucking pesticide industry and the herbicide industry. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7865.66s)]
*  It's so scary. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7869.419999999999s)]
*  So many people that wanna downplay the fact [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7870.66s)]
*  that they're not fucking with the herbicide industry. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7873.86s)]
*  It's pretty heavy. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7875.82s)]
*  They did a study recently and they found [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7876.66s)]
*  that 90 something percent of people [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7879.0599999999995s)]
*  have glyphosate in their blood. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7881.62s)]
*  I think about that all the time. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7883.74s)]
*  Fucking terrifying. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7885.0599999999995s)]
*  It has such gnarly health, like negative health impact. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7885.9s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7892.139999999999s)]
*  Before I came here, I was watching YouTube. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7893.259999999999s)]
*  I got down a rabbit hole and it was like a little thing. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7894.66s)]
*  It was like a documentary about, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7897.379999999999s)]
*  there's this massive upswing in the amount of people [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7899.42s)]
*  so men in their 20s are taking Viagra. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7902.58s)]
*  Super, super common. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7905.54s)]
*  Wow. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7907.62s)]
*  And they're saying it's because their testosterone [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7908.46s)]
*  has dropped so much that it's really difficult [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7910.46s)]
*  for them to perform sexually. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7912.34s)]
*  Well, there's also microplastics. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7914.9800000000005s)]
*  Microplastics, which is- [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7917.82s)]
*  Glyphosate and microplastics are some of the biggest things. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7919.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of things [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7921.9s)]
*  that are disrupting our endocrine system. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7923.54s)]
*  Well, I talk about it all the time, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7925.66s)]
*  but there's a doctor, Dr. Shana Swann, [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7926.7s)]
*  who wrote this book called Countdown. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7928.74s)]
*  And she makes this connection between the introduction [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7930.46s)]
*  of petrochemical products and people using them, [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7935.14s)]
*  like microwaving with plastic and plastic bottles [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7938.06s)]
*  and all these different things that leach plastic [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7941.5s)]
*  and chemicals into your, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7943.5s)]
*  and the direct decrease of male testosterone, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7944.7s)]
*  the shrinking of human beings' taints when they're babies, [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7949.06s)]
*  which is a direct indicator [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7953.5s)]
*  of whether someone's a male or a female. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7954.7s)]
*  In males, in mammals, the taint is 50 to 100% larger [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7956.5s)]
*  than females, but they're shrinking. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7960.14s)]
*  And then also miscarriages in women. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7962.38s)]
*  There's a much higher instance of miscarriages [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7964.54s)]
*  and infertility. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7966.900000000001s)]
*  And she thinks a lot of it is directly attributable [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7968.14s)]
*  to these plastics and these phthalates, [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7970.860000000001s)]
*  these different chemicals that get into the bloodstream. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7973.740000000001s)]
*  All of our food comes in plastic. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7977.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking awful for us. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7979.660000000001s)]
*  What a weird world we live in. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7982.26s)]
*  It is. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7984.46s)]
*  Billions and billions of people, [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7985.3s)]
*  we have to feed all of them, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7986.860000000001s)]
*  so we use monocrop agriculture, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7988.02s)]
*  so we've ruined the topsoil, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7990.34s)]
*  so we're using industrial fertilizers [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7991.179999999999s)]
*  and all that stuff pours off with rainfall [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7993.34s)]
*  and gets into the rivers. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7995.66s)]
*  And there's so few farmers that have decided [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=7996.86s)]
*  that people like Whiteoaks Pastures, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8001.46s)]
*  like Will Harris, the guy I've had on this podcast, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8003.74s)]
*  talked about this too many times, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8006.46s)]
*  but I'll say it one more time. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8007.74s)]
*  There's a video that shows the difference [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8008.74s)]
*  between his farm and the neighboring farm. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8010.86s)]
*  His farm is an industrialized farm, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8012.94s)]
*  or the farm next to him, rather, is an industrialized farm, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8014.94s)]
*  and his farm is a regenerative farm. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8017.42s)]
*  And it shows when rainfall hits [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8019.18s)]
*  and the water rushes through the topsoil, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8021.18s)]
*  and his neighbor's farm, it's polluting the river, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8025.34s)]
*  like very clearly, a line of, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8029.3s)]
*  a very clear line of property [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8032.54s)]
*  between his farm and the neighboring farm [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8034.58s)]
*  and what it's doing to the environment. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8037.14s)]
*  Just polluting rivers with pesticides, herbicides, [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8039.26s)]
*  industrial fertilizer, all that runoff, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8044.14s)]
*  and it just gets right into the rivers, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8046.46s)]
*  killing fish and... [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8048.34s)]
*  Has an impact over the last couple decades [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8049.9800000000005s)]
*  of us consuming it all. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8052.26s)]
*  This is the river that runs near his property. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8053.26s)]
*  So this is his neighbor's property [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8055.820000000001s)]
*  and look at his property. Wow. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8057.1s)]
*  Look at the difference. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8058.14s)]
*  It's fucking bonkers, man. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8059.38s)]
*  When you see the clear difference between the two places, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8061.26s)]
*  I mean, it's a direct line. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8064.58s)]
*  Yeah, that stuff has an impact, man. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8068.1s)]
*  Yeah. It really does. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8069.900000000001s)]
*  Well, and I don't know what the fuck we can do [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8071.06s)]
*  to mitigate it at this point. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8074.1s)]
*  You can eat all elk. Yeah. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8075.62s)]
*  But not everybody can. No. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8077.58s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8078.94s)]
*  It's like, and I've heard that argument before, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8079.78s)]
*  like, yeah, you're out there hunting for your food, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8081.5s)]
*  but everybody can't hunt for their food. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8083.18s)]
*  Right, but you don't, you can't ask everybody to, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8084.66s)]
*  but you, as an individual, you can make healthier choices. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8088.58s)]
*  And healthier choices is buying food from regenerative farms. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8092.62s)]
*  There's plenty of them in Texas. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8095.78s)]
*  There's plenty of them that exist. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8097.0599999999995s)]
*  There's polyphase farms. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8098.74s)]
*  There's white oaks pastures they deliver to you. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8100.22s)]
*  There's plenty of like regenerative agriculture. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8102.46s)]
*  There's a company that I work with, Carnivore Snacks. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8106.38s)]
*  It's like my favorite, like, if I need to run out the door [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8109.06s)]
*  and I'm looking for something healthy that I have to eat, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8112.7s)]
*  like a Vimakar, they have these Carnivore Snacks. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8115.06s)]
*  It's sliced ribeye. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8119.06s)]
*  It's just ribeye with salt. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8120.74s)]
*  And they, it's almost like a meat pastry. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8122.9400000000005s)]
*  It's not like jerky. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8126.34s)]
*  It's so delicious. Well. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8127.54s)]
*  And it's got fat on it. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8129.06s)]
*  And I bring them to the UFC, like when I'm at the UFC [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8130.42s)]
*  and I have to sit there for six hours, that's what I eat. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8134.14s)]
*  I eat those. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8137.34s)]
*  And it's from a regenerative farm. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8138.18s)]
*  Like you can find healthy choices. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8139.02s)]
*  Maybe those healthy choices aren't available [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8141.54s)]
*  to 8 billion people. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8143.38s)]
*  Yes, that's true. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8144.34s)]
*  But you as an individual can choose [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8145.74s)]
*  to use those healthy choices in your life. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8147.900000000001s)]
*  And if you can't afford them, this is your health. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8149.78s)]
*  Do the best that you can to make sure [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8152.9800000000005s)]
*  that you get the healthiest food in your body. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8155.5s)]
*  Do the best. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8157.7s)]
*  No doubt. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8158.54s)]
*  And it's never been easier to find them either. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8159.38s)]
*  It's so much more widely available [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8160.42s)]
*  than it was even just a few years ago. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8162.34s)]
*  People are so much more conscious of it now. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8164.14s)]
*  When we grew up, people used to really believe [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8166.58s)]
*  that, oh, just eat a balanced diet. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8168.58s)]
*  You don't need to do anything. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8170.14s)]
*  Like, ugh. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8171.3s)]
*  What is a balanced diet? [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8172.820000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8174.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8174.900000000001s)]
*  We're talking about the food pyramid. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8175.740000000001s)]
*  Do you get blood work done? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8176.58s)]
*  Do you know how your body's functioning? [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8178.3s)]
*  Do you know how it's optimized? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8180.660000000001s)]
*  Getting your blood work done is super important, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8183.1s)]
*  way more so than I would have thought 10 years ago. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8185.46s)]
*  No, I think so too. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8189.02s)]
*  My wife kept telling me, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8190.26s)]
*  you gotta get your blood work done. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8191.1s)]
*  You gotta get your blood work done. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8192.42s)]
*  All the stuff you're eating, everything, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8194.34s)]
*  how you're living, you wanna see that picture. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8195.14s)]
*  I would have never thought I was deficient [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8198.38s)]
*  in a bunch of stuff. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8200.38s)]
*  Crazy vitamin D. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8201.38s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8202.82s)]
*  I would have never imagined that a surfer [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8203.66s)]
*  is deficient in vitamin D. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8206.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8207.34s)]
*  I feel great. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8209.58s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's good, dude. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8210.42s)]
*  You look great. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8211.619999999999s)]
*  I'm really interested to hear your results [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8213.18s)]
*  from this insane stem cell regimen. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8214.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'll keep you posted. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8216.98s)]
*  I've been doing it. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8218.22s)]
*  I don't do the selfie video thing pretty much ever [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8219.06s)]
*  on my social media stuff. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8223.1s)]
*  It's just super cringy [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8224.86s)]
*  and something I don't feel comfortable with, [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8225.9s)]
*  but I've been doing it lately. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8227.42s)]
*  So I've been trying to share my experience [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8229.02s)]
*  and kinda just tell my story about what I'm doing, [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8231.02s)]
*  where I'm going, how I'm feeling, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8233.7s)]
*  and sharing my protocol, [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8235.460000000001s)]
*  just because I have a lot of personal friends [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8237.1s)]
*  around my age that are pretty beat up. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8239.78s)]
*  And some of them are considering surgery [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8241.9s)]
*  and everybody's got aches and pains and injuries. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8244.54s)]
*  So I'm trying to share it for them. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8247.74s)]
*  And then I just had an incredible amount of feedback [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8249.58s)]
*  from people who wanna know more. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8252.7s)]
*  I feel like from all the stuff that I'm doing and learning, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8255.42s)]
*  I can help maybe demystify the stem cell thing. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8258.740000000002s)]
*  It seems pretty misunderstood. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8261.740000000002s)]
*  So I don't know everything there is to know about stem cells. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8264.78s)]
*  I'm not pretending that I do. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8267.140000000001s)]
*  But what I'm finding out, I'm trying to share with people. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8269.060000000001s)]
*  So I'll try and keep you posted. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8271.26s)]
*  That's awesome, dude. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8274.02s)]
*  Please do. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8274.94s)]
*  And I really wanna hear what it does for your back [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8275.78s)]
*  because the disc thing is very interesting [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8278.1s)]
*  because I do know that there have been some examples [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8280.060000000001s)]
*  of people that have had these injections [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8283.54s)]
*  and that have increased their disc space [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8284.380000000001s)]
*  where the discs have actually grown. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8286.42s)]
*  So people that are suffering from regenerative disc disease [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8288.26s)]
*  and were told that they might need fusions [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8291.42s)]
*  or they might need an artificial disc, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8293.380000000001s)]
*  they've managed to stop that. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8295.26s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8297.34s)]
*  I have a friend named Mike Escamilla. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8298.18s)]
*  He's kinda like me, but in the BMX category. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8301.980000000001s)]
*  So he was like an X Games athlete, like a BMX guy. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8305.060000000001s)]
*  Super high level athlete, energetic, really fit, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8309.460000000001s)]
*  beautiful young family, kids. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8313.060000000001s)]
*  And his back got worse and worse [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8315.02s)]
*  to where he could barely get out of bed, couldn't work, [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8317.460000000001s)]
*  couldn't live his normal life. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8320.980000000001s)]
*  And he got so bad to where he was really, really depressed. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8323.140000000001s)]
*  And he went, that's part of the reason [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8325.54s)]
*  I got stem cells recently, but he went to the same place, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8328.300000000001s)]
*  CPI, the place I went to in Mexico, [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8331.740000000002s)]
*  and got the stem cell injections in his back. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8334.060000000001s)]
*  And 10 months later, full life changer, full on, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8336.580000000002s)]
*  he's like thriving, he's living virtually pain-free. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8340.42s)]
*  Like I talked to him on the phone like four weeks ago [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8344.7s)]
*  because I wanted to kind of see what the process was like. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8347.460000000001s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not joking, dude, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8350.140000000001s)]
*  you're gonna trip out on your back. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8351.380000000001s)]
*  I didn't, my back was not nearly as bad as his was, [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8353.380000000001s)]
*  but yeah, he was like a change my whole life. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8356.900000000001s)]
*  How often can you do it? [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8359.26s)]
*  Did you ask them like how many times he can go back? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8361.42s)]
*  I don't think there's really a limit. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8363.5s)]
*  I don't think you can do it really consistently, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8365.34s)]
*  but I know people who go there for the IVs all the time. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8367.98s)]
*  They go once a month for stem cell IVs. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8371.7s)]
*  And then the fighters, all the UFC guys, [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8374.1s)]
*  like there was a couple of different fighters there [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8376.460000000001s)]
*  when I was there, and they go after every fight. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8378.7s)]
*  Wow, makes sense. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8383.26s)]
*  I mean, you have to be proactive about recovery [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8385.54s)]
*  when you're dealing with a fucking sport like that. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8387.460000000001s)]
*  And it's just such a shame that you have to go [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8390.18s)]
*  to another country to get that done. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8392.78s)]
*  It really is, yeah. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8394.42s)]
*  The cool thing is they have a cartilage specific stem cell [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8395.699999999999s)]
*  now, I was gonna tell you that about your meniscus, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8398.3s)]
*  because my understanding is your meniscus [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8400.859999999999s)]
*  is a lot of cartilage, right? [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8402.259999999998s)]
*  But they have a cartilage specific stem cell now. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8403.9s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8406.539999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8407.38s)]
*  I forget the name of it, it starts with an M. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8411.58s)]
*  But a bunch of people when I was there [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8413.74s)]
*  were getting the cartilage stem cell based on their MRIs. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8415.259999999998s)]
*  So if they had cartilage issues [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8417.939999999999s)]
*  and their doctor felt like they did, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8419.9s)]
*  they would give you the option of adding cartilage stem cells [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8422.14s)]
*  to your injections. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8425.779999999999s)]
*  So that's something to think about. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8426.699999999999s)]
*  Well, keep me posted. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8428.539999999999s)]
*  I will. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8429.939999999999s)]
*  Let me know. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8430.779999999999s)]
*  I've got a bunch of back issues. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8432.699999999999s)]
*  I've been able to mitigate them, [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8434.06s)]
*  and they don't bother me nearly as much [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8436.699999999999s)]
*  as they did when I was younger. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8439.22s)]
*  Because I'm very proactive about strengthening my back. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8440.859999999999s)]
*  I do this whole core series where it's like, [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8443.939999999999s)]
*  I strengthen all the muscles in my back and my neck, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8447.939999999999s)]
*  use the iron neck and all these different things. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8450.94s)]
*  Around the sides too? [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8452.1s)]
*  Yeah, everything. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8452.94s)]
*  I do everything. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8453.78s)]
*  The core stuff helps a lot. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8454.62s)]
*  It helps a lot. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8455.7s)]
*  Just to keep that whole area stable and strong [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8456.54s)]
*  and reinforce it. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8459.94s)]
*  Anyway, brother, good to see you. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8462.1s)]
*  This was fun, man. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8463.26s)]
*  Always fun. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8464.26s)]
*  This was fun. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8465.1s)]
*  Always good to see you. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8465.94s)]
*  Keep me posted. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8466.78s)]
*  Will do, 100%. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8467.62s)]
*  I'm really excited to hear that. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8468.460000000001s)]
*  I might have to travel down there myself. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8469.300000000001s)]
*  All right, thanks. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8471.34s)]
*  Bye everybody. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NBu5PNyjhU&t=8472.58s)]
