# Joe Rogan Experience #2001 - Gabriel Iglesias
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5.72s)]
*  Finally you're here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=12.8s)]
*  Finally. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=14.4s)]
*  Finally. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=15.4s)]
*  You're one of the most requested guys ever. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=16.4s)]
*  I was like, I gotta see him somewhere. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  I gotta run into him. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=18.8s)]
*  We'll make it happen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=20.28s)]
*  So we made it happen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=22.0s)]
*  I'm excited to see you, brother. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=23.0s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=24.32s)]
*  Finally. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=25.32s)]
*  I mean, we've run in so many similar circles for so many years. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=26.32s)]
*  We ran into each other at the Canelo fight. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=28.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=30.88s)]
*  But I mean, God, I've been seeing you for 20 years. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=31.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=34.68s)]
*  Well, you were always the hero of the Ice House. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=35.68s)]
*  We'd go down to the Ice House. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=37.68s)]
*  How the fuck does he sell out so many shows? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=38.68s)]
*  Gabriel's doing like a two in the afternoon show, a 4 p.m. show. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=41.2s)]
*  How many shows did you do in a day at one point in time? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  The most I ever did in one day. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=47.6s)]
*  Like full sets, not just like a 10 minute spot. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=49.32s)]
*  Four shows. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=51.68s)]
*  Four full one hour shows. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=52.68s)]
*  But yeah, we were doing matinee shows at the Ice House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=54.68s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=57.28s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=58.28s)]
*  Like, you know, we'd go down there and see the signs and all the pictures. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=59.28s)]
*  It's like this is crazy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=62.88s)]
*  Like who the fuck is doing that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=63.88s)]
*  You know, because I was doing, they were calling them kid shows because I was allowing all [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=66.16s)]
*  ages. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=70.04s)]
*  Oh. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=71.04s)]
*  Bob Fischer was bending the rules to let me have, you know. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=72.04s)]
*  That's great. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=74.28s)]
*  Because your act is perfect for that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=75.28s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, I tailored it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=76.76s)]
*  I tailored it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=79.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=80.12s)]
*  So, of course, you take a cuss words on certain topics. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=81.12s)]
*  But for the most part, it was a friendly show. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=82.12s)]
*  Well, you can do that is what I'm saying. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=83.88s)]
*  Like you could you float in and out of that world. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=85.88s)]
*  You know, you could be clean and then you can fuck around. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=88.88s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=90.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=91.88s)]
*  A little cut loose. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=92.88s)]
*  So the set that you would hear at two o'clock probably isn't the set you'd hear at, you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=93.88s)]
*  know, the 1030 show. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=96.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=97.88s)]
*  So you go from that to doing Dodger Stadium. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=98.88s)]
*  Well, there was a couple shows in between. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=101.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=103.36s)]
*  But what the fuck, dude? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=104.36s)]
*  What is that? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=105.36s)]
*  That had to be a trip. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=106.36s)]
*  What the fuck was that like? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=109.52s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=110.88s)]
*  I thought that I was going to be super nervous doing that show, but it was probably one of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=112.8s)]
*  the most calm experiences for me as far as like not feeling pressure because it felt [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=117.56s)]
*  more like a celebration versus me having to perform. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=123.0s)]
*  Like all these people are already here because they know what I've done over the years. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=127.0s)]
*  And it's not like, oh, I got to make sure I hope I have a good set. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  There's I forget how many people total, but there were so many people there that all they [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=135.32s)]
*  want is for you to do good. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=139.96s)]
*  They want to see you succeed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=142.39999999999998s)]
*  They want this to go well for you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=145.32s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  And to feel that energy of people wanting you to succeed, wanting you to do good. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  People that were there for the ride back at the ice house, you know, 20 some odd years [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  ago. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=157.44s)]
*  Look at all those people. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=158.44s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=162.16s)]
*  It was a beautiful moment. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=164.16s)]
*  I was choked up in the first 30 seconds walking out there because they just kept cheering. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  And then I said, we did it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=170.64s)]
*  And it was just it was over after that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=172.44s)]
*  So it was a big emotional show for me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=174.08s)]
*  On Netflix, it was an hour and almost two hours. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=178.4s)]
*  But the actual night I was on stage for over three. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=181.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=184.24s)]
*  And they could not get me off that stage because then I broke broke out a bottle of tequila. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=185.0s)]
*  And then I turned it into a big quinceaneras. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=188.96s)]
*  What I did at the end. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=191.44s)]
*  And I got fined by Dodger Stating for going over the time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=193.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=196.96s)]
*  If you run the light of the club, it's all right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=197.76s)]
*  Come on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=199.6s)]
*  Maybe you mess up. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=200.12s)]
*  How much did they fine you? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, it was over 100. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, Dodger Stating. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=203.28s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=204.92s)]
*  Stop being cunts. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=206.0s)]
*  Is that like operating costs? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=207.16s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=208.32s)]
*  Well, you got to figure all the costs that go into like, you know, the union, the staff. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there's so many people that work there. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  How do you work it, though? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=216.2s)]
*  I do it all over again. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  It was the greatest night of my life and so happy to pay the fine. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=218.16s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=221.32s)]
*  That's when I saw Bill Burr do Fenway Park. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=222.32s)]
*  Similar sort of situation, you know, like, holy shit. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  And to do it in your hometown. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's the best part. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  I think it's always harder to get love at home. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=231.72s)]
*  You know, that's why you go out on the road and you do your thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=235.16s)]
*  And I think that getting that love at home, like I never got to perform at a comedy club [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=237.2s)]
*  at home until I became successful on the road. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=242.35999999999999s)]
*  I didn't get the Laugh Factory's or the comedy stores or the improvs until I went out and did. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=245.32s)]
*  That doesn't make sense, though. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=249.44s)]
*  Why would that be? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  Were you hanging around? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  You got to figure 20 some odd years ago, you know, maybe they had a Latino night. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=253.48s)]
*  You know, you had to really know somebody. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=257.96s)]
*  Somebody had to really vouch for you or you just it was weird. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=260.56s)]
*  Most of my shows were at bars. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=264.84s)]
*  So what year did you start? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=266.72s)]
*  Started in 97. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=268.08s)]
*  97. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=269.64s)]
*  So most of those years you're hopping around doing bars. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=270.4s)]
*  One nighters and stuff like that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=274.48s)]
*  Oh, so and so has a room. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=275.92s)]
*  So and so has a room. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=276.88s)]
*  You know, blah, blah, blah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=278.12s)]
*  Joey Diaz took me to a lot of those places. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=278.96s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=280.96s)]
*  Joey Diaz would tell you, come on, motherfucker, you want to go to the real place. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=281.36s)]
*  He would take you to some Chinese restaurant in the middle of nowhere. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=284.48s)]
*  It's run by Mexican people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=287.84s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=289.28s)]
*  Joey would take you on a school bar with Spender's Weekends. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=290.32s)]
*  He would go to all these fucking crazy shows. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=293.28s)]
*  But he had a philosophy behind it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=295.64s)]
*  He was like, you know, I want to go everywhere. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=298.12s)]
*  I want to go everywhere. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=299.96s)]
*  I want to get in front of these fucking momos. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=300.8s)]
*  I want to go down to the East Side and rock those motherfuckers. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=302.92s)]
*  He was just like he wanted to do all kinds of different shows, like just to like feel it out. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=306.0s)]
*  And I think he's right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=311.28s)]
*  They're like those dingy bar shows. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=313.0s)]
*  There's something about those shows that teach a little extra. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=314.84s)]
*  It's humbling. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. The cool part was, is that I was used to performing in places like that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=318.64s)]
*  before I actually got an audience that was willing to just be quiet and listen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=322.96s)]
*  Yes. So I felt like, oh, wow, that was hard, you know, because you have to come out [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=326.68s)]
*  the gate swinging to get people in a bar, people that are focused on the game, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  focused on trying to hook up, having a drink, trying to wait, you know, waiting for somebody. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=336.08s)]
*  There's all kinds of different things happening. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=339.68s)]
*  And so the fact that, you know, to be able to go out there and get their attention. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=341.88s)]
*  Yeah. You know, that that that was like a like it was school. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it is school. It is school. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=349.2s)]
*  It's a school that no one is going to give you a lesson plan. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=350.88s)]
*  You got to kind of do it all yourself. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=353.36s)]
*  And you got to learn from the other people that are doing it like Joey. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=355.44s)]
*  But it's like I did the same thing in Boston. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=357.76s)]
*  We mostly we got road gigs because those are the ones that, you know, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=360.36s)]
*  they would pay you to drive two hours and do some, you know, 40 minutes in front of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=364.04s)]
*  a bunch of crazy people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=368.52s)]
*  And you were excited to do it. Oh, my God. Yeah, it was amazing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  It just the fact that you were making money doing comedy was amazing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=372.28s)]
*  And you're learning how to do it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=375.08s)]
*  You're learning how to do it the hard way in restaurants and bars and pubs and just [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=376.32s)]
*  yeah, weird little outdoor venues. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=381.28s)]
*  And there was no social media back then. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=383.23999999999995s)]
*  No YouTube, no TikTok video clips, no nothing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  You could post. You just had to go out. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=387.08s)]
*  But honestly, that's great because that gave you this chance to, first of all, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=389.0s)]
*  know you really wanted it because if you were really going to grind it out [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=393.2s)]
*  every night, going all these weird shitty places for no money for years, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=396.44s)]
*  for years, you're not making any money. You got to be committed to that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=400.28s)]
*  Because a lot of people, they got half one foot in, one foot out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=403.67999999999995s)]
*  They have one good set. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=406.2s)]
*  And they're like, you know, maybe I'll give comedy a try. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=407.28s)]
*  But guys like you and guys like me were out there every fucking night. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=409.52s)]
*  I knew that with time, money would come as long as I stuck it out. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, I was in a very cush position when I started doing stand up. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  So it was it was a little, you know, challenging to say goodbye to security. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=424.2s)]
*  You know, I had I had a great gig selling cell phones. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=429.32s)]
*  I was making about five K a month, you know, and in 1997, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=432.2s)]
*  you know, working in sales, making that I've never had insurance. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=436.2s)]
*  I had, you know, a nice little PPO plan. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=439.16s)]
*  Couldn't you work there during the day? I did. For how long? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  I did. I lasted about a year because I found out that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't just do my job and then go do shows at night and then go home. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=448.64s)]
*  You couldn't go home. You had to stay out. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=453.8s)]
*  We had to wind up at a Denny's. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=455.76s)]
*  You had to wind up at some freaking taco shop or whatever at two, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=457.2s)]
*  three o'clock in the morning talking to other comics because that was the only [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=459.92s)]
*  other way you were going to find out about another show. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=462.88s)]
*  You couldn't send a tweet. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=465.36s)]
*  You couldn't send a text because you didn't have that as an option. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=466.36s)]
*  You had to talk to people. Right. So and so has a room. Oh, really? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=469.04s)]
*  What's OK. Give me that number. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=472.6s)]
*  And you had to learn to write numbers and save numbers and information [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=473.88s)]
*  and learn how to follow up. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  Hey, what do you think about, you know, and then? Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=478.64s)]
*  Can you vouch for me? That meant a lot back then. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=481.48s)]
*  Someone calling on your behalf. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  Hey, so and so's got a tight 10. Yeah, it's huge. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, that's huge. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  So staying out late at night, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=489.16s)]
*  coming home at four or five in the morning and then having to be up [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=492.24s)]
*  at seven to go do my nine to five. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=495.24s)]
*  It fortunately, I was young and I was able to hang for about a year. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  And then I just couldn't. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  I was falling asleep at work and I got caught. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=502.8s)]
*  I got caught. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, I was working inside of a little kiosk selling cell phones. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=508.20000000000005s)]
*  And one time I just kind of let me do some inventory here on the floor. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=511.56s)]
*  And then I guess I was snoring and somebody caught. Oh, my God. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=514.84s)]
*  I'm like, oh, my God. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=518.04s)]
*  That's a beautiful story, though. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=521.36s)]
*  That's an American dream. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=523.32s)]
*  And I thought that because I had done a couple of television shows [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=524.28s)]
*  and I saw the money that I could make doing stand up at that time, I said, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=528.8s)]
*  oh, well, and you start doing the math, the delusional math. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=532.2s)]
*  Well, if I get one of these a month and I do this and this and this, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=536.04s)]
*  I don't need this much to pay my rent, this much to pay my car note. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=538.56s)]
*  I'll be I'm going to be fine. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=540.88s)]
*  And I quit my day job and I got evicted from my apartment [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=542.24s)]
*  because I ran out of money so fast. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=546.96s)]
*  They came after my car. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=550.24s)]
*  The repo guy was looking for the car. I got evicted. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=551.4s)]
*  I went to go sleep on my sister's couch. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=553.8s)]
*  It was it was one of those. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=556.92s)]
*  And everybody's like, well, go get your job back. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=558.24s)]
*  And I'm like, if I do, then then I'm not going to. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=560.04s)]
*  How old were you at the time? 20, 21. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=562.84s)]
*  Yeah, you could still kind of fuck up a little bit at 20, 21. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=565.44s)]
*  I had no problem sleeping in a car at that age. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=568.76s)]
*  Now I'm like, hey, you know, maybe I got to get that day job back. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=570.4s)]
*  But no, back then I was willing to do whatever it took. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=574.64s)]
*  But that's what you're supposed to do. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=577.4s)]
*  You know, I've met a lot. Tony did that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=579.1999999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of people who did that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=581.12s)]
*  A lot of people slept in their car. Brian Simpson was homeless. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=582.52s)]
*  Yeah. It's like if you really believe in it, you know what? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=585.4s)]
*  Yeah. What are you willing to do? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=588.0s)]
*  What are you willing to sacrifice to make it happen? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  Because there's a path. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=591.68s)]
*  It can be done. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=594.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just not easy. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=595.72s)]
*  It's not easy. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=597.56s)]
*  And you got to hope you have talent and hope you're not delusional [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=598.68s)]
*  and hope you can figure it out and maximize that talent. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=602.6s)]
*  Because a lot of people say that they want it, but do they? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=606.4s)]
*  You know, it's like you say a lot of things. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=610.8s)]
*  People are scared of being uncomfortable. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=614.52s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=616.4s)]
*  They're scared of challenges. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=618.16s)]
*  They're scared of being uncomfortable. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=619.3199999999999s)]
*  And I get it. I got it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=621.12s)]
*  But, you know, the key is like being around a bunch of other people [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=622.88s)]
*  that are also taking risks. It helps you a lot. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=626.68s)]
*  You see them do it and then you want to do it, too. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  If you're around people that are trying to, bro, listen to me, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=631.52s)]
*  get your fucking job back. Stop being a moron. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=633.92s)]
*  You're not going to make it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=636.7199999999999s)]
*  I never thought you were that funny. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  If you're around guys like that, a lot, those are your buddies. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=639.68s)]
*  That's a drag. That's a drag. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=644.5999999999999s)]
*  Well, a lot of those voices I heard were family, not necessarily friends. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=646.4s)]
*  It's like even closer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=649.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but they're just looking out for you. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=651.4799999999999s)]
*  You know, they're worried. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=654.52s)]
*  They didn't know. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=656.4s)]
*  You know, if they had a magic crystal ball, they'd be like, oh, OK. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=657.2s)]
*  Oh, I should have been more supportive. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=660.08s)]
*  But in some nice in the beginning, they're also like, oh, oh, you want to do that? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=661.84s)]
*  How cool? Yeah, yeah, you can do it. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=666.04s)]
*  Go for it. Chase your follow your dreams. Happy for you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=668.36s)]
*  And then you do it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=672.28s)]
*  Oh, OK. Well, when they see the reality, like the homeless part [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=673.88s)]
*  in the not having any money part, not having any health care part when you used to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=678.04s)]
*  and then the uncertainty of it all. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=683.32s)]
*  It's not like going to law school. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=685.5200000000001s)]
*  You graduate the bar. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=687.08s)]
*  Yeah, there's a path. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  We don't even have a school for it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=690.0s)]
*  You have to figure it out on your own. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  It's like every other even if you want to mean there's many, many, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=692.96s)]
*  many self-taught musicians, right? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=695.4000000000001s)]
*  But you could learn on YouTube how to play guitar. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=697.2s)]
*  You can learn on YouTube how to play the piano. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=700.44s)]
*  You can learn. You can take lessons. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=702.24s)]
*  They're available everywhere. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=703.8800000000001s)]
*  Someone could teach you how to maximize your voice, whatever singing voice. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=705.2s)]
*  There's nothing that anybody can show you about comedy. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=709.48s)]
*  Because it's such a broader spectrum, like, you know, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=713.0s)]
*  it works for one person will definitely not work for another. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=715.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and I think it's all in and what you put out. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that makes it makes it work. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=723.72s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=725.92s)]
*  The only thing like a comedy class is good for is it actually gets people on stage. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=726.6s)]
*  Getting on stage is the first thing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=730.52s)]
*  One thing that I feel like I had an advantage [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=732.64s)]
*  when I started doing stand up was [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=735.92s)]
*  I took speech classes in high school. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=738.92s)]
*  And so I was very comfortable getting up in front of the class and just talking, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=742.16s)]
*  just talking. There was no jokes back then. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=747.52s)]
*  It was just can you get in front of the crowd? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=749.36s)]
*  Can you can you convey a message? Can you talk about whatever? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=751.6s)]
*  So I got very comfortable with people being quiet. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=755.24s)]
*  A lot of times people don't they freak out when the audience is quiet. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=759.0s)]
*  And I like it when they're quiet because it means they're listening. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=762.44s)]
*  They're listening to you. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  And at this point, if the crowd is quiet, they trust that whatever [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=767.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do is going to work because they're paying attention. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=771.5200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's yeah, it's so it's one of those like it took a long time [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=774.44s)]
*  for me to get used to that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=778.6400000000001s)]
*  Hmm. Yeah. Getting used to talking to people. That's huge. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=780.1600000000001s)]
*  Just getting used to being like the center of attention. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=784.08s)]
*  That's you having eyeballs. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=786.72s)]
*  Because a lot of times, you know, it's like people say, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=788.24s)]
*  oh, the scariest thing in the world jumping out of an airplane or doing this [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=789.9599999999999s)]
*  or, you know, go cliff diving. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=792.4799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, most people cannot handle being in front of a crowd. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=794.3199999999999s)]
*  Most people get uncomfortable. They're like, oh, you know, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=798.36s)]
*  Whitney told me, when he comes home, he told me that that originates from [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=800.9599999999999s)]
*  the ancient tribes that we used to live in when you were brought [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=805.16s)]
*  in front of the tribe to be judged. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=807.92s)]
*  That's why they were all looking at you. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=810.24s)]
*  I mean, there's all these people are going to is not it's either [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=812.0799999999999s)]
*  there's some sort of a dilemma that you have to warn people about [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=814.24s)]
*  or you're being judged. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  Both those things are riddled with anxiety. Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=818.52s)]
*  So we have a natural instinct. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=821.36s)]
*  Not like, oh, look, all my friends. What's up, guys? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=824.0799999999999s)]
*  It's just like, oh, Jesus, everyone's looking at me. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=826.92s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=829.92s)]
*  I used to I was teaching martial arts. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  So I was used to people listening to me. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=833.92s)]
*  So I was used to I did that. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=835.92s)]
*  I think that helped me a lot because I had a lot of social anxiety [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=837.12s)]
*  when I was young, like just talking to people. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=839.48s)]
*  But then when I had to learn how to teach people, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=841.68s)]
*  you know, so I teach classes all the time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=844.76s)]
*  So I would always have like groups of people that I was demonstrating things to. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=846.8s)]
*  So I got used to talking to people that way. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=850.28s)]
*  Yeah. Then you get a you get a microphone [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=852.3599999999999s)]
*  and you hear your voice for the first time on a PA and you're like, oh, wow. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=855.3599999999999s)]
*  That's you know, I remember like hearing myself and like, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  that's what I sound like to people. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=861.8s)]
*  You know, like, oh, let me put some bass in there. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=863.92s)]
*  Yeah. Also, you want to use the mic, you know, and there's the dilemma. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=866.52s)]
*  Do I keep it in the stand or hold it? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=871.28s)]
*  There's so many factors. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=873.68s)]
*  Someone taught me about mic technique, you know, the way you hold it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=874.88s)]
*  Do you hold it tight, high up? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=877.64s)]
*  Do you know there's some comics that ride the mic really lower, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=879.16s)]
*  keep the mic really lower. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=881.68s)]
*  There's some that choke them. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=883.12s)]
*  Have it right here like rapping or something. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=884.52s)]
*  It's like a rap. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=886.4s)]
*  Joey Diaz keeps it in the stand. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=888.28s)]
*  And that works for him. That works great for him. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=890.4s)]
*  Kevin does the same thing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=891.96s)]
*  Kevin Hart will keep it in the stand. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=892.88s)]
*  And, you know, I've tried that. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=894.2s)]
*  It does not work for me. I need to be mobile. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=896.16s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like I have too many hands. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=897.88s)]
*  You know, I want that right there. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=900.44s)]
*  And then I want to be able to switch hands, move it around. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=901.96s)]
*  And then I'm one of those that tell stories with their hands. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=905.56s)]
*  So I'm always, you know, I got to be able to be mobile and move and just, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=907.6s)]
*  you know, all right, here we go. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=911.48s)]
*  It's crazy that you made it and then started getting in at the clubs in L.A. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=912.84s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=917.64s)]
*  Yeah. So first time out on the road, I was I was doing a comedy club [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=919.24s)]
*  called Bart Reid's Comic Strip in El Paso, Texas. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=923.16s)]
*  And I was there as an opener. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=925.56s)]
*  And that was the first time I did a comedy club. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=926.84s)]
*  Was Bart Reid's Comic Strip, El Paso. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=930.84s)]
*  That's where I had to go. And I'm from L.A. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=933.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I've done a million bars. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=935.08s)]
*  Yeah. And dives and little holes in the wall. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=937.0s)]
*  That was the first real comedy club. The first actual comedy club. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=939.1600000000001s)]
*  And then I remember I went on the road actually with Joe Diaz [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=941.52s)]
*  and with Marilyn Martinez. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=944.64s)]
*  And so I did a show with the two of them and getting a comedy [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=946.2s)]
*  course from Marilyn Martinez and Joey Diaz at the same time [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=949.32s)]
*  is something I will never forget because the two of them are so like [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=953.0s)]
*  they were just yin and yang. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=956.52s)]
*  You know, I remember how how awesome that friendship was. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=958.1600000000001s)]
*  And they were just so real and raw with me. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=961.32s)]
*  And I'm just sitting there and I'm this 21 year old kid. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=963.8s)]
*  And I'm just like, oh, my God. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=966.28s)]
*  You know, if you knew the two of them, you'd know like, wow, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=970.28s)]
*  that's that's a hell of a lesson that you get. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=972.92s)]
*  Well, that is a beautiful thing about people when they think you're funny, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=976.24s)]
*  that they will take you take you under their wing. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=978.56s)]
*  They will give you some advice and we'll talk to you about stuff. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=981.04s)]
*  Both of them are super nice. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=983.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're both super nice. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=985.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I miss Marilyn. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=987.16s)]
*  She was always cool to have hang around the store. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=988.4799999999999s)]
*  She was hilarious. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=990.68s)]
*  Sit in the back and listen to Marilyn critique the comics. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=991.88s)]
*  Look at him. He thinks he's going to make it. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=996.0s)]
*  Her and Joey together, too. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=999.24s)]
*  What a one to punch. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1000.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1003.16s)]
*  Like having relationships with those comics that are already gone through the gates [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1005.04s)]
*  and they can tell you what's going on like, hey, I was right where you were at. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1008.0s)]
*  You can just keep going. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1011.68s)]
*  You're going to be all right. Hang in there. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1013.4s)]
*  Yeah. Keep doing sets. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1014.96s)]
*  You know, and the beauty of it back then, which I think, you know, is missing now [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1016.64s)]
*  is because social media is so strong. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1021.76s)]
*  You know, everybody would rather just talk to the phone. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1023.76s)]
*  Whereas back then, I felt like it was a lot more. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1026.28s)]
*  I've met so many comics online that I haven't met face to face yet, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1028.68s)]
*  which I think is crazy. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1031.8s)]
*  Yeah. You know, well, we're a little scattered now. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1033.12s)]
*  You know, it's like not like a home base anymore. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1036.04s)]
*  You know, it used to be home bases were New York and L.A. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, L.A. is kind of like fucked and Austin is more of a home base [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1041.36s)]
*  for a lot of comics than L.A. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1045.72s)]
*  And New York is different than it used to be. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1047.6s)]
*  You know, a lot of guys kind of moved to different places during the pandemic. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1050.28s)]
*  And so it's weird. It's weird. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1054.24s)]
*  It's like this like I guess the cellar is a great place to go and hang out [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1056.48s)]
*  with people in the store. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1059.3999999999999s)]
*  Still a great place if you know who's going to be there to hang out with people. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1060.48s)]
*  But that's half the fun for me. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1063.8s)]
*  I mean, I know it's like in the early days, you were getting phone numbers [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1065.96s)]
*  and learning about gigs, but it's also you're hanging out with comics. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1068.92s)]
*  You know, that is my favorite thing because you're all talking about comedy [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1071.8799999999999s)]
*  and you can't talk about comedy with people that don't get it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1075.48s)]
*  Exactly. Trying to try to, you know, talk to my brother about it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1078.6000000000001s)]
*  He's like, oh, yeah, it sounds cool. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1081.0s)]
*  Like, you don't understand. And it's just like, oh, yeah. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1082.3200000000002s)]
*  You have to talk to people who are actually doing it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's just they're just the most fun to talk to. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1087.44s)]
*  Like when we have shows at the mothership and then afterwards [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1091.3200000000002s)]
*  are hanging out in the green room, we're just laughing, just laughing [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1094.56s)]
*  and talking shit and slapping the couch and and having a good time. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1097.72s)]
*  And everyone's just getting on everybody. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1101.56s)]
*  And it's just it's fun. It's really fun, man. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1103.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a good time. Music's playing. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1106.28s)]
*  You know, it's like one of the coolest parties [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1107.84s)]
*  you could ever be a part of. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1110.04s)]
*  And it happens like almost every night. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1111.12s)]
*  And we're always laughing like, God damn, we're so lucky. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1113.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because we could be doing something completely different. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1116.32s)]
*  But you do something that sucks. You gotta appreciate it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1118.72s)]
*  The beauty of just laughter and just being able to hang out [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1120.72s)]
*  and be real and just hang out. Yeah. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No, it's amazing. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1127.9599999999998s)]
*  It's we're very fortunate we found it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1129.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's the one job where it's like normally when you're done, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1132.1999999999998s)]
*  you punch out and you go home. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1135.08s)]
*  But like once you get off stage, like, OK, now, now just hang out [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1136.44s)]
*  and watch everybody else and get a drink. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1139.96s)]
*  You know, how come you don't have food at your club? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1142.44s)]
*  Just sorry. Just put that. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1147.28s)]
*  Why do I not want to have food at my club? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1148.44s)]
*  Because it's a distraction. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1149.92s)]
*  Do you want to look down and see people eating while they're watching a show? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1151.48s)]
*  They're there for a show. I get it. Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1154.6000000000001s)]
*  I get it with you. I get it. I get what you're saying. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1157.8400000000001s)]
*  But yeah, no, it gets in the way. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1161.44s)]
*  It used to be no food at the store. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1164.52s)]
*  And then they started adding food and was just like, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1166.12s)]
*  I think it just gets in the way. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1168.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, I don't have a problem with clubs that do it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1169.7199999999998s)]
*  I've a lot of clubs have great food. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1171.8799999999999s)]
*  The improvs always have great food. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1173.4399999999998s)]
*  But I think it's a distraction, you know, and also it brings roaches. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1175.04s)]
*  OK, I didn't think about that. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1181.32s)]
*  Yeah. If you have food laying around. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1182.6s)]
*  One of the things that we found when we first looked at the club, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1184.1999999999998s)]
*  the club was the Alamo Drafthouse before it was the comedy club. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1187.6s)]
*  So we went in there and they had this huge kitchen [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1192.08s)]
*  that would make pizzas and shit in and those fucking giant roaches everywhere. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1193.8400000000001s)]
*  Like you were seeing these fat boys just running around big, thick, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1198.8s)]
*  cigarette lighter looking motherfuckers running around. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1203.0s)]
*  Like, Jesus Christ, those fly to. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1205.4s)]
*  There was a very brief time where we entertained the idea [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1209.5600000000002s)]
*  of having a restaurant in the club, too. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1211.92s)]
*  And I was like, no, no, fuck that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1213.8s)]
*  And everybody that I talked to, all the comics were like, no, no food. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1215.8400000000001s)]
*  No food. It's just a distraction. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1218.96s)]
*  People have mouthfuls of food and they're barely paying attention. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1221.16s)]
*  It's just like it's weird. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1223.48s)]
*  It's just, you know, eat before you go. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1224.84s)]
*  Got it. Bring snacks. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  You can always get someone to go next door. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1230.72s)]
*  There's a pizza place next door. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1232.04s)]
*  There's a Mexican joint that's right next door to that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1233.24s)]
*  There's there's all sorts of burger places on Sixth Street. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1236.32s)]
*  There's a lot of different food. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1240.0s)]
*  There's food trucks. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1241.3600000000001s)]
*  Just send one of your boys to go out and get some. You're good. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1242.4s)]
*  I'll do it. I just had to ask. I hear you. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1245.04s)]
*  Yeah. Comedy Magic Club is the best food. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1250.28s)]
*  Yes. Yes. That's that's like a real restaurant. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1252.32s)]
*  It's legit. It is like gourmet. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1255.48s)]
*  Yeah. Their steak is like a great restaurant steak. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1257.28s)]
*  Yeah. You could actually go there just just to eat. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1260.48s)]
*  And it would be like a great restaurant just to eat at. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1262.72s)]
*  Yeah. His place is wild, too, because all the memorabilia on the wall, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1265.12s)]
*  like Robin Williams outfit from Popeyes on the wall. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1268.72s)]
*  Yeah. Lucio Ball's dress. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1271.52s)]
*  So he's got some he got some really, really good ones. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1274.48s)]
*  Yeah. Do you collect VW vans? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1276.6s)]
*  Explain. That's more like hoarding. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1280.68s)]
*  I got I got a lot of Volkswagen's. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1282.72s)]
*  How many do you have? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1286.0s)]
*  I don't want to sound like a douche, but I lost count. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  It's over 20. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1289.8000000000002s)]
*  You have more than 20 Volkswagen's. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1291.0s)]
*  But why them? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1293.72s)]
*  It's a Volkswagen was a Volkswagen bus. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1295.4s)]
*  A 1968 Volkswagen bus was my first car. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1298.68s)]
*  And for some reason, once I started talking to Jay Leno, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1301.88s)]
*  you know, he showed me his collection and he started telling me about [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1307.44s)]
*  investing money and being able to enjoy your investment. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1310.6000000000001s)]
*  And so I had gotten my ex-girlfriend her first car back. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1313.96s)]
*  And then his guys helped me get my first car back, which was a bus. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1318.0s)]
*  And they said, well, if there's anything else you want, let me know. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1321.96s)]
*  And I go, well, if you come across another one of these, let me know. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1324.04s)]
*  They call me three days later. We got one. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1326.56s)]
*  And I said, well, I'll take it. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1328.2s)]
*  And that just kept going. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1329.24s)]
*  And the reason why is just it's such a cool, iconic car. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1331.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like there's some guys that collect nothing but Porsches. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1335.4s)]
*  And with a bus, no one's looking at you like, oh, my God, look at another Porsche. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1338.68s)]
*  But with buses, it's just it's you know, it's it's it's a fun bus. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1342.7600000000002s)]
*  It's it's a cool car. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1346.6000000000001s)]
*  And I I wanted to be known as the Volkswagen bus guy. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1348.0800000000002s)]
*  Look at all your buses. Yeah. So crazy. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1352.7600000000002s)]
*  I started collecting them about 10 years ago. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1355.68s)]
*  So do you buy them in this condition? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1357.8400000000001s)]
*  No, no. Well, in the beginning, I would try to buy them as, you know, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1360.0400000000002s)]
*  in as good a condition as possible. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1364.08s)]
*  But then, you know, I met some people that do some amazing work. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1366.52s)]
*  There's a friend of my name, Henry Marchena, who does all the restorations. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1370.1999999999998s)]
*  And he will take, you know, a bus that's all rusted out and completely just [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1373.0s)]
*  in shambles and he'll make a Picasso. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1377.6s)]
*  He'll make a work of art. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1380.1599999999999s)]
*  These these buses are just [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1381.72s)]
*  people come in and they see them. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1385.0s)]
*  I mean, they light up, they light up and. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1386.4399999999998s)]
*  So you got some other cars in there, too. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1390.6s)]
*  I do. I do. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1392.32s)]
*  Is that a three, five, six that the one to the road? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  That's another VW. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1396.72s)]
*  I can't see what else you have there. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1399.04s)]
*  Well, I no longer have the bugs. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1401.8s)]
*  I only have one bug now, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1403.76s)]
*  but it's mostly buses, mostly buses and one bug. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1406.72s)]

*  Look at that. Is that the rest of my is the original? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1446.72s)]
*  No, that's the original. It's got all the paperwork. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1449.08s)]
*  I actually got that one at the Barrett Jackson Car Auction. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  So ninety six. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1455.1599999999999s)]

*  So, I mean, it's not that I'm just strictly Volkswagen. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1475.6799999999998s)]
*  I get it. That's that's how it started. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1477.92s)]
*  And the beauty of it is I have people that are constantly sending me pictures. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1479.44s)]
*  Hey, my friend is selling this. My friend is selling that. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  So what is that? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  That is a Camaro that they converted into a Firebird. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1486.88s)]
*  I no longer have that one, but I do have a nineteen seventy nine Trans Am. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1490.3200000000002s)]

*  There's a company called Trans Am Depot in Florida, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1497.8000000000002s)]
*  and they will take a Camaro and then they'll turn it into a Trans Am. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1500.44s)]
*  And it has a Pontiac logo and everything. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1504.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Now, that's the one I still have right there. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1507.2s)]
*  It's blue. It's beautiful. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1508.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. Look at that pretty thing. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1510.08s)]
*  Trans Ams are gorgeous. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1513.36s)]
*  It's long to the whole hood is really, really. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1515.12s)]
*  Does anybody ever make a Trans Am that's like that [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1517.48s)]
*  is like a really solid driving car, though? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1520.96s)]
*  Has anybody done like a wild Resto mod with like a custom chassis? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1524.12s)]
*  I mean, they must have. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1528.0s)]
*  I've never driven one or seen one. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1529.32s)]
*  And all the Trans Ams I've been in have always been manual. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1532.04s)]
*  No, I mean, stock. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1535.2s)]
*  I mean, like whether or not they're, you know, they change the suspension. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1536.76s)]
*  Manual transmission is the way to go with a car like that always. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1541.72s)]
*  But I mean, is anybody done like a real Resto mod with a Trans Am? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1544.1200000000001s)]
*  They must have. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1548.3600000000001s)]
*  You never see them, though. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1550.08s)]
*  You see more like kind of in stock form. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1551.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they try to keep it looking like it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1553.52s)]
*  You know, they want to have that look. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1556.04s)]
*  But anyway, yes, I have a bunch of muscle cars, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1557.96s)]
*  but people know me as the Volkswagen bus guy. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1560.88s)]
*  What does it say there, Jamie, at the top? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1563.44s)]
*  Yeah, Trans Am gets a stunning Resto mod overhaul from Retro Designs. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1566.24s)]
*  OK, so this one they did. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1569.68s)]
*  Yeah, there they go. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1572.12s)]
*  They jazzed up the engine. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1573.2s)]
*  That's pretty. Yeah. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1575.04s)]
*  Still got skinny tires. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1579.56s)]
*  Take that photo of the back of it, the one that shows the back right there. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1581.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1587.24s)]
*  Look how skinny those are. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1588.68s)]
*  They're not that bad. A little bit better. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1589.84s)]
*  Not that bad. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1590.84s)]
*  But yeah, yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1592.84s)]
*  So, you know, on top of the Volkswagens, I do got, you know, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1593.9199999999998s)]
*  the muscle car collection, which is nice. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1596.08s)]
*  Dude, there's nothing like muscle cars. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1597.72s)]
*  There's something about those things like whatever they were doing [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1599.9199999999998s)]
*  in that time period from the late 60s to the early 70s, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1602.32s)]
*  whatever they do and then they stop doing it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1606.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's very different. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1608.04s)]
*  Yeah. And I have some friends that are purists when it comes to muscle cars. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1609.52s)]
*  So they want to keep it stock, keep it the way that it was. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1613.32s)]
*  And then there's some that I'm like, you know, dude, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1616.12s)]
*  there's nothing wrong with putting an air conditioner in a car. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1618.08s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with, you know, adding certain safety features. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1620.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1622.9199999999998s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1623.9199999999998s)]
*  Like all that numbers matching? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1624.8799999999999s)]
*  I get it. But that's not for me. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1627.32s)]
*  I get it that people want to collect them numbers matching, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1629.08s)]
*  but it's just for them. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1631.84s)]
*  It's like they say to the other numbers matching guys and everybody's like, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1633.0s)]
*  but yeah, there's there's more people that just want to enjoy the car, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1637.1599999999999s)]
*  have fun with the car, and they could care less what the numbers. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1640.04s)]
*  You want to not be sucking gas fumes through the exhaust. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1642.84s)]
*  Like, how bad do some of those smell? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1647.32s)]
*  Oh, man. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1648.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1650.8799999999999s)]
*  When you have a car that's it's over 40 years old, you get used to the smell of gas. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1652.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they stink of gas. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1656.04s)]
*  And then you think at first it's leaking. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1657.36s)]
*  And no, it's not. That's just the way that the car smelled back then. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1659.44s)]
*  Yeah. You're breathing in fumes. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1661.96s)]
*  You get in the headache. You smell the oil, you smell the gas. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1664.0s)]
*  But resto mods don't like resto mods. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1666.56s)]
*  Like what I was showing you, the Land Cruiser, when they use a modern [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1668.68s)]
*  crate engine, they can just change it completely. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1672.24s)]
*  Yeah. So it looks original, but it drives. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1675.3999999999999s)]
*  It handles like a modern car. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1678.16s)]
*  That's what I like. I just like the the there's the character of those cars. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1680.28s)]
*  It's undeniable. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1684.44s)]
*  Like if they made one today like that, I would say I want to buy one. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1685.64s)]
*  Like if they made a resto, like if they can't do it, which is kind of crazy, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1689.92s)]
*  because like you could buy one from a company like Roadster Shoppe. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1694.44s)]
*  They made me a 1969 Camaro. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1697.76s)]
*  But you can't buy a 1969 Camaro from Chevy. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1699.76s)]
*  Like if Chevy said, look, we're going to make a 1969 Camaro. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1702.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not going to have any airbags. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1705.76s)]
*  It's going to have disc brakes. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1707.16s)]
*  But like, you know, six piston disc brakes and we're going to do a modernized [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1709.0s)]
*  suspension. But it's going to be a 1969 Camaro. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1712.1200000000001s)]
*  But it's going to be a 1969 Camaro with a two thousand twenty three [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1715.0400000000002s)]
*  Camaro engine and all the electronics and all that jazz. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1719.68s)]
*  People would buy it like crazy. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1723.0400000000002s)]
*  But you can never get away with it because regulations would wouldn't allow it. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1724.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And then living in California, all these men, you know, hard it is [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1729.16s)]
*  with getting smogged. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So all my cars are 1974 and below. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1735.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Just because I don't want to deal. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1739.84s)]
*  Yeah. That's good. I don't want to deal. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1741.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that funny? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1744.4399999999998s)]
*  Like, as long as they're old, they can just pollute like crazy. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1746.08s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I just think it's interesting that, you know, as time goes by, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  they don't move the they don't move the needle. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1753.28s)]
*  Like, they still keep it at 1974. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1755.08s)]
*  It's like, come on. Well, yeah, I think that's because it's almost impossible. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1757.04s)]
*  Like if you want to get like a 1974 Porsche [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1761.84s)]
*  and you want to convert it to modern standards of exhaust, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1764.9599999999998s)]
*  I wonder what they would even have to do. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1769.0s)]
*  It might ruin the car. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1770.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. It's going to take away from the originality of it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1772.24s)]
*  But is it going to make it a better driver? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1774.9599999999998s)]
*  You're going to have more fun with it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1776.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1778.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think they would have to like I know they do rest of mods [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1779.36s)]
*  with those old Porsches, but I think they just take everything out [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1782.12s)]
*  and put all modern shit in. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1785.48s)]
*  You know, they just kind of remember. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1787.12s)]
*  But even then, I think it's still held to the same standard of a 1974 car. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1788.68s)]
*  Like as long as it's, you know, like the exact number [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1794.16s)]
*  and everything is from that age, even that's you're kind of lying. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1797.48s)]
*  It's kind of not really a 1974 car. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1800.48s)]
*  You know, it's really a 2023 car. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1803.28s)]
*  Like if you had a 74 Porsche built by some mad man, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1806.16s)]
*  like maybe this wicked air cooled engine. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1809.64s)]
*  And so you're driving around a 1974 car that's got all brand new parts. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1811.96s)]
*  Yeah, but they're still going to hold you to the rules. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1816.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I did do a with one of my Volkswagen's. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1818.04s)]
*  I actually did a it's called a Subaru swap. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1821.08s)]
*  So I took out the engine from the Volkswagen and I put in a Subaru [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1824.44s)]
*  turbo engine in it because it because it fit perfectly. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. And so now that car is like it's fast. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1831.92s)]
*  It is super fast and it's quiet. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1835.84s)]
*  I saw a video online. See if you can find this. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1837.8799999999999s)]
*  It was a Ford, an old Ford Econoline van [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1840.48s)]
*  that they put a supercharged Coyote engine in. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1844.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. So is this those ones where your face is like right at the windshield. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1847.6s)]
*  You ever see those? Yeah. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1852.24s)]
*  It's like such a flat faced weird thing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1853.24s)]
*  But he's got this crazy fucking supercharged [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1856.7199999999998s)]
*  Coyote Mustang engine in it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1860.52s)]
*  Just with the Econoline. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1862.08s)]
*  Yeah. Some of these modifications, they don't really, you know, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1865.84s)]
*  they're not worried about the height or, you know, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1868.52s)]
*  you got to put everything else in there to match so that it can handle right. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1870.9599999999998s)]
*  They're doing it just for funsies. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1874.24s)]
*  Nobody really needs an Econoline van with a supercharged fucking Coyote engine in. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1876.0s)]
*  Like I heard anywhere. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1880.36s)]
*  I heard a rumor that they were going to make a Hellcat minivan. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1881.76s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what? I think I'm down. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1885.28s)]
*  They come down. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1888.64s)]
*  No, this is it's actually even older than that. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1889.88s)]
*  That's a 1970 one. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1892.68s)]
*  But that one, someone did the same kind of thing to. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1894.64s)]
*  They made that one a sleeper. That's interesting. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1897.16s)]
*  They kept that one kind of looking real stock on the outside. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1900.68s)]
*  The other one was like a tan one. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1903.24s)]
*  It was like a tan Econoline van, but it was a really old one. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1905.6s)]
*  The real flat faced front ones. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1909.24s)]
*  Yeah. No worries. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1912.76s)]
*  I should have saved it. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1915.2s)]
*  Someone sent it to me on Instagram, Solaris. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1916.2s)]
*  Yeah. But I just always thought it was funny that you picked that one car. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1919.32s)]
*  So I always wanted to know what was it. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1923.56s)]
*  It was just one of those things where I really liked it. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1925.1599999999999s)]
*  And I started [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1927.96s)]
*  making every single color that they came out with. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1930.76s)]
*  And then I ran out of I use the entire palette. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1933.12s)]
*  Yeah. And so then we just started having fun creating our own color schemes. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1935.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1939.76s)]
*  Do you drive them? Yeah. You take them out. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1941.6799999999998s)]
*  They all work. I try not to take them on the freeway. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1943.76s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple that are like really, really good on the freeway. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1946.36s)]
*  But most of the time, I just rather keep them on the streets. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1948.76s)]
*  And they've all broken down. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1951.36s)]
*  They've all left me on the side of the road at one point in time. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1952.52s)]
*  Because if you're not driving them every day, you're going to have issues with them. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1955.6s)]
*  For sure. You know, so I got a team that's like, all right, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1958.28s)]
*  I'm going for a drive beyond be on standby. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1960.48s)]
*  I won't take them out at times when I don't have people that I can get a hold of. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1963.64s)]
*  And they're 50 plus year old cars and they're stock. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1967.44s)]
*  And when you're when you're saying you have some that are good on the highway, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1970.64s)]
*  would it most of them want a four cylinder in them? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1973.76s)]
*  They're all four. They're all four. They're all tiny. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1976.16s)]
*  They have four bolts to put those engines in. Really? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1977.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a, you know, it's a big lawnmower. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1980.4s)]
*  So the one that does better, though, on the highway, is it just a stronger engine? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1982.56s)]
*  Just healthier? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1987.0s)]
*  I think that because it's the one that gets driven more like my favorite one [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1987.92s)]
*  to drive in the 1968 that I have, it's called a bay window. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1992.24s)]
*  And it's the generation that came after the split. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1996.52s)]
*  So the buses had that little widow's peak in the two windows. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=1998.8400000000001s)]
*  That's 1960 that stopped in 1967. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2004.04s)]
*  And then 1968 was the full size windshield. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2006.44s)]
*  And so a lot of the components, everything was more user friendly. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2009.2s)]
*  It was more comfortable. The brakes were better. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2013.52s)]
*  The suspension, you were able to, you know. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2015.44s)]
*  Yeah. Like the windows are slide on a 67 word as the other one, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2017.68s)]
*  the windows go all the way down. They slide left and right. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2021.52s)]
*  Yeah, slide left and right. So you can't hang your arm out. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2023.6000000000001s)]
*  You can't do any of that. But it's 1968 and above. Wow. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2026.3600000000001s)]
*  And what is it like a hundred horsepower or something? If that. Wow. If that. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, most of them, I mean, they started off like what? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2034.24s)]
*  Twenty, twenty five, thirty, twenty, between twenty five and thirty horsepower [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2036.3200000000002s)]
*  for a van. Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2041.16s)]
*  How many bands tried to make their way across the country in those things? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2043.6000000000001s)]
*  Oh, man. You know what that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2046.2s)]
*  But I mean, that was the that was the Sprinter van of its day. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2047.48s)]
*  Yeah. People would turn those into camper vans or they get the band in there [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2050.28s)]
*  or they, you know, they'd get the whole thing out. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2054.0s)]
*  It was a panel van or they, you know, there were so many uses for those back then. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2056.2s)]
*  Yeah. Did the Manson family have one of those? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2060.08s)]
*  I wouldn't doubt it. It seemed like something they would have. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2063.16s)]
*  See if the Manson family had a VW van. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2065.92s)]
*  Someone actually tried to sell me Dr. Kovorkian's Volkswagen. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2068.8s)]
*  Dude, they have that at the. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2073.12s)]
*  I got the option to buy it. Really? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2074.96s)]
*  Yeah. They tried to sell me the van, the yellow that bus [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  that's now at the museum in Las Vegas. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2079.4s)]
*  So they they reached out to me because they knew, you know, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2082.28s)]
*  and so anytime something Volkswagen bus related pops up. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2085.08s)]
*  That's crazy. So the. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2088.08s)]
*  So you had a chance to buy it before the museum. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2090.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But I'm like, I can't. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2092.52s)]
*  Like, oh, it felt so eerie. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2094.4s)]
*  It belongs in the museum. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2096.6s)]
*  And even though it's like, OK, it's a good talking. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2097.56s)]
*  Hey, guess what? I have over here. I got the death machine. Fuck that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2099.92s)]
*  That's just crazy. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2103.28s)]
*  So, yeah, you could see it at the [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2104.0s)]
*  I think it's called the Museum of Death. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2106.04s)]
*  I think I almost bought David Koresh's 1968 Mustang. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2108.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. It was for sale online. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2112.1200000000003s)]
*  And they were advertising it was David Koresh's Mustang. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2115.44s)]
*  And apparently it had a providence so they could prove it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  And I was like, my finger was hovering over my phone. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2120.0800000000004s)]
*  I was like, do I? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2123.84s)]
*  I really don't want those. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2125.52s)]
*  I really wanted to 69, but I mean, like, did you want his? Yeah. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2126.6400000000003s)]
*  Part of me was like, yes. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2130.2000000000003s)]
*  But the other part of me is like, what if I'm opening up doors [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2131.6s)]
*  that I could never close? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2134.16s)]
*  What if he truly was the branch Davidian staff car made his way into the car? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2136.04s)]
*  Like Christine. Remember that movie? Oh, my God. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2140.12s)]
*  I love that movie. Fuck. Yeah. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2142.7599999999998s)]
*  They know it was it. They never explained. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2144.4s)]
*  Waco cult leader. That was the car. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2146.12s)]
*  I mean, come on, son. That looks strong. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2148.12s)]
*  That is beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2149.48s)]
*  1968. And if I was going to just drive it stock like that, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2151.44s)]
*  I mean, just fuck around, take it to the store. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2155.72s)]
*  But I thought about it and I was like, I don't think I don't want that fucking [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2158.36s)]
*  bad karma. And you can you could find a car like that. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2161.44s)]
*  I have one that looks like that, but I got the white stripe on it. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2165.56s)]
*  Beautiful. It's a fun car. Oh, man. Yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2169.2400000000002s)]
*  Fun car. Yeah. They're amazing cars. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2171.84s)]
*  Those are in the rest of Monson. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2174.52s)]
*  Those are particularly good because they're well balanced. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2175.96s)]
*  You know, it's like it's good shape, good size car for that kind of application. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2178.92s)]
*  I have a 69 that Roadster shop built me. I fucking love it. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2183.48s)]
*  I saw it online. Looks like it looks really, really cool. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2187.0s)]
*  So fun. It's so fun. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2189.4s)]
*  I I had done as much as I could to modify the car to make it as safe. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2191.48s)]
*  So, like, for example, I put LEDs, I took out the old stuff and I put LEDs [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2198.56s)]
*  so that it's bright, changed the cluster inside to make sure that it was all [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2203.0s)]
*  digital and bright so that I could see it. Yeah. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2207.32s)]
*  And I had people getting upset with me over it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2210.64s)]
*  I'm like, come on, man. I'm like, I just want to enjoy the car. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2212.68s)]
*  Oh, because you were changing the original stuff. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2215.28s)]
*  Let me just let me just stop talking. Those fools. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2217.2400000000002s)]
*  Those people are idiots. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2219.12s)]
*  Let's leave it alone. Yeah. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2220.48s)]
*  Come on, bro. Everyone's going to die. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2222.08s)]
*  Everyone and then someone else is going to enjoy it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2225.72s)]
*  Just enjoy it. Don't try to like there's plenty of them that are out there [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2227.52s)]
*  that are stock. It's not like we're running out of them. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2230.96s)]
*  You know, I got to tell you, I bought something really cool last week [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2233.44s)]
*  and I got a chance to play with it yesterday. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2237.68s)]
*  I bought a 1994 Ford Mustang Cobra. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2240.4s)]
*  The difference between that and anything else out there is that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2246.08s)]
*  it only had 12 miles on it. Oh, wow. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2250.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's yeah. So it was a dealer car. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2252.56s)]
*  It was covered in plastic. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2254.48s)]
*  It still had the sticker in the window. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2255.8s)]
*  It still had all the different, you know, the barcodes and just everything on it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2257.96s)]
*  So I had to rip the plastic off the seats. Whoa. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2262.7200000000003s)]
*  And that for me was the coolest thing. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2266.1600000000003s)]
*  It's just like, wow. 1994. 1994. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2267.76s)]
*  And so the guy who bought it, I guess, was a collector of Mustangs. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2271.04s)]
*  And he just bought it and let it sit. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2275.04s)]
*  And it just he kept it in a temperature controlled room. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2277.48s)]
*  And I guess something happened where, you know, it became available. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2280.84s)]
*  And I jumped on it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2284.28s)]
*  And I'm like, because 1994 is the year I graduated high school. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2285.48s)]
*  And that's the car I wanted. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2288.52s)]
*  And so I think it's cool that I'm able to buy a brand new old car. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2289.76s)]
*  That's crazy. How many of those are out there? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2294.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's you know, I got lucky. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2296.92s)]
*  I found it online and I just jumped. I'm like, it's mine. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2298.88s)]
*  It's funny how cars like not just muscle cars, because muscle cars are fast, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2302.56s)]
*  but cars like a Volkswagen, they're fun to drive. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2307.28s)]
*  You know, if they're slow, it's like so much more engaging than a regular car. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2311.36s)]
*  It's like you're on a little ride, like you're in a go kart. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2315.1200000000003s)]
*  It's exactly what it is. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2317.52s)]
*  And then you're sitting high. It's a different experience. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2318.52s)]
*  You know, it's like now you can get an SUV and of course you're up there. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2321.36s)]
*  But to be that high up and then you're literally your face is the windshields [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2324.5600000000004s)]
*  right here. No safety. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2328.4s)]
*  You hit anything and you're just by and you feel everything. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2330.32s)]
*  You feel every bump and twist of the road. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2334.28s)]
*  You got the wheel and you're sitting on you're sitting over the wheels. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2336.44s)]
*  So it's just suspension sucks everything. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2339.0s)]
*  You go around a corner. It's terrible. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2343.16s)]
*  I actually got up on two wheels one time by accident. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2345.84s)]
*  I'm lucky I didn't die. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2348.7200000000003s)]
*  I was getting on the free one. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2350.64s)]
*  I just cut the corner too hard and I felt it, man. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2351.56s)]
*  And then you just boom. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2353.76s)]
*  It's really interesting because it does. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2355.8s)]
*  A car does not have to be fast to be engaging. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2357.56s)]
*  You know, that's what I think gets lost with a lot of these paddle shifter cars, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2360.4s)]
*  these new cars. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2364.0s)]
*  Everybody's just trying to go zero to 60 faster and get on around the Nurburgring [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2365.04s)]
*  faster. But that's not really what makes a car fun. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2368.36s)]
*  Like you don't really drive like that in real life. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2372.0s)]
*  You would like you'd rather have a car that's more fun, slower, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2375.04s)]
*  because like some cars like my Tesla, if I'm going to you don't even notice [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2379.8s)]
*  you're going 80 miles an hour. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2383.56s)]
*  It just goes whoosh. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2384.48s)]
*  And also you go in 80. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2385.52s)]
*  But if I'm going 80 and like an old Porsche, you feel that feel everything. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2386.76s)]
*  And you feel it like it's like exciting. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2394.0s)]
*  Everything is like alive. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2397.08s)]
*  You know, I have an old 1993 RS America. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2399.08s)]
*  So it's got no power steering, no air conditioning, no radio, no nothing. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2403.72s)]
*  Air cooled, super light, tiny little car. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2408.72s)]
*  And it only has like 300 horsepower. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2411.8s)]
*  But it's like one of my favorite cars to drive. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2413.96s)]
*  But you feel everything. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2415.48s)]
*  It's a ride. Everything you are part of the ride. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2416.96s)]
*  It's a Disneyland ride. You're part of that. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2419.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's slow as shit. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2421.28s)]
*  Compared to like my Tesla. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2423.8s)]
*  But when you're when you're doing if you're doing 80 in that versus 80, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2425.4s)]
*  the test, you feel like, wow, I'm going 100 miles an hour. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2428.28s)]
*  You feel alive. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2432.0s)]
*  I feel like you're on a motorcycle or something. It's crazy. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2433.88s)]
*  It's like, oh, and it's also the way they handle. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2436.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you feel the tires break. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2439.76s)]
*  Like you have a connection to the tires. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2442.32s)]
*  Like when you hit the limit, you feel a kick out. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2444.6000000000004s)]
*  You know where that limit is. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2446.7200000000003s)]
*  It's almost like your shoes, you know, when you know, when you're sliding. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2448.92s)]
*  You know I'm saying, you know, to stop yourself sliding. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2452.6800000000003s)]
*  You're waiting to see the smoke. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2455.2400000000002s)]
*  Like any second now, you're going to something's going to something's going to snap. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2457.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And you're going to have to pull over. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2460.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, those cars to the engines in the back. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2461.6400000000003s)]
*  And so the ass end kicks out around corners, you know, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2463.88s)]
*  and if you're going around a corner and you let off the gas, you know, fishtail it. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2466.76s)]
*  Yeah. Like especially those old like old turbos, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2470.4s)]
*  so wild ones that people got. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2473.5600000000004s)]
*  Those things, they call them widow makers. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2478.0400000000004s)]
*  But giant ass engine in the back. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2480.0800000000004s)]
*  Skids out real easy. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2482.24s)]
*  Go around a corner, let off the gas, you spin around a circle and crash. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2484.4799999999996s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2487.52s)]
*  You have to teach people to keep their foot on the gas when they're going around a corner. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2489.68s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2494.12s)]
*  Most people. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2495.9599999999996s)]
*  You know, fortunately, I don't have the need for speed as much. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2497.64s)]
*  If I have a nice little straightaway, I'll get it on the 405 if there's an opportunity. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2500.8399999999997s)]
*  All my driving I do after midnight. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2505.64s)]
*  I get out of the house at night and I like taking my drives between midnight and three in the morning [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2510.04s)]
*  because there's nobody out there. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2515.36s)]
*  Just enjoy driving. And I can just drive. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2516.92s)]
*  Yeah. You know, so I'll do a lap. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2518.64s)]
*  So I'll take like the 605 to the 210 to the 134 and I'll just go through L.A. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2521.08s)]
*  Do you know who Magnus Walker is? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2527.24s)]
*  I know the name. Magnus Walker is this Porsche expert. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2529.28s)]
*  He rebuilds old Porsches, makes them amazing. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2532.24s)]
*  But he like he has these videos about Porsches that are like a love letter to Porsche. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2535.68s)]
*  He takes these old Porsches and drives them on the highway. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2541.4s)]
*  He's a cool looking dude. He's got crazy dreadlocks and fucking wears funky clothes and shit. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2543.92s)]
*  I think he made his money in the clothing business. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2548.68s)]
*  Pretty sure. And so he has this warehouse in downtown L.A. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2551.3599999999997s)]
*  where he keeps all these Porsches and he's got a video where he gets out and drives them. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2555.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's like he looks like a Magnus. Yeah, that's Magnus Magnus. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2559.04s)]
*  He's got a cool English accent. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2563.2s)]
*  But see if you can find one of the videos of him, because there's a video of him. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2565.16s)]
*  I think it's called 9-Eleven Outlaw. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2569.08s)]
*  There was like there was a video called 9-Eleven Outlaw, I think. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2572.52s)]
*  It was like one of the oldest videos where it just sort of it like. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2579.44s)]
*  Urban Outlaw, that's it. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2586.3999999999996s)]
*  So this was like the video where I found out about this a long time ago. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2588.16s)]
*  But this dude makes all these cars. Give me some volume. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2592.32s)]
*  So this is a real old car. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2597.36s)]
*  This is probably like a 68 or 69 or something like that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2600.1200000000003s)]
*  And he's got, you know, like just sort of a juiced up stock engine, but it's all air cooled. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  Everything is super, super lightweight. Like that car pulling weighs two thousand pounds. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2610.6000000000004s)]
*  And when, you know, he's got like the little air ducts he's put into the side. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2615.76s)]
*  A lot of the stuff that he's done in the car is very custom. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2620.6s)]
*  But listen to that. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2624.52s)]
*  So then he takes these motherfuckers out downtown L.A. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2631.24s)]
*  And it's when you watch him do it, it's very addicting. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2634.08s)]
*  Like here, give him. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2638.6s)]
*  Go go earlier when you see him actually going fast in these things. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2645.32s)]
*  No, no, no. Yeah. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2650.36s)]
*  Yeah. So this is this is it. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2654.84s)]
*  Like that is a beautiful little car. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2657.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's not fast, not compared to modern standards, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2661.1600000000003s)]
*  but the pleasure you get out of driving one of those things. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2664.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like everything is analog. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2669.0s)]
*  You feel every bump. It's like it's all just giving you feedback. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2671.04s)]
*  It's exciting. And you see how there's no traffic and he's enjoying it. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2674.88s)]
*  It's a nighttime drive and he can actually, you know, give a gas if he wants to or chill. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2678.72s)]
*  This is before the pandemic, though. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2682.8799999999997s)]
*  God, now it's a goddamn zombie movie. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2684.96s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. I kind of enjoyed the drives during that. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2686.56s)]
*  I think that's what got me out of the house. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2688.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, during the middle of the pandemic. Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2689.72s)]
*  I'm just like, wow. Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2691.3199999999997s)]
*  I just mean, in downtown L.A., downtown L.A. is fucked. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2693.16s)]
*  It's fucked. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2697.9199999999996s)]
*  So I don't even know if he's still there anymore. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2700.56s)]
*  This is quite a while ago. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2702.48s)]
*  I would have thought. Yeah, you did. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2704.12s)]
*  But I mean, I would if I was in downtown L.A., I really would have. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2707.04s)]
*  Like that place is crazy. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  Did I remember filming Fear Factor in downtown L.A. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2712.7200000000003s)]
*  in like 2003 or something like that? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2715.2400000000002s)]
*  It was crazy back then. I was like, this is wild. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2717.8s)]
*  There's so many homeless people down there. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2720.76s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2722.44s)]
*  The the amount of, I mean, tent cities everywhere you look. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2724.04s)]
*  Insane. Everywhere you look. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2727.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's just like, what the hell? Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2728.6800000000003s)]
*  What the hell? So much. It's like it's. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2731.2400000000002s)]
*  And what kills me is some of these tents have like electricity, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2734.56s)]
*  like they got generators and TVs. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2738.36s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, they're homeless or are you camping? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2740.16s)]
*  Poles and shit. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2744.0s)]
*  They're opening up poles and pulling wires out and diverting power. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2744.96s)]
*  Some of these guys are like homeless electricians. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2749.96s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's like, OK, that's you know, I don't. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2752.2s)]
*  I feel like that they're making that choice. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2754.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, there's probably as fucked up as it is some kind of community [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2757.64s)]
*  to being a part of this struggle with all these other people [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2762.12s)]
*  that are sleeping on the streets, you know. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2764.6s)]
*  And then there's open air drug use and it's tolerated. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2766.92s)]
*  And, you know, and then there's places where you can go, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2770.2s)]
*  especially in Skid Row and you can get some help and get food. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2772.3199999999997s)]
*  It's fucked because it doesn't seem like it's getting any better at all. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2776.24s)]
*  They move in places, they shift them out of certain spots [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2780.0s)]
*  when it becomes inconvenient. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2782.64s)]
*  And then they sort of drift back in eventually. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2784.3199999999997s)]
*  And then the other places, they get bigger and bigger. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2786.72s)]
*  The places where they neglect it, they just keep getting bigger. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2788.64s)]
*  That's that's all I'm seeing is they're getting kicked out. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2791.04s)]
*  And then they're finding, you know, yeah, like, oh, that [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2793.12s)]
*  that community is now over here. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2796.28s)]
*  It's crazy that this was never an issue when we were kids. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2798.36s)]
*  It was never an issue. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2801.92s)]
*  Like, when do you remember when you were a kid? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2803.6800000000003s)]
*  Ever seen tents? Never, never. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2805.84s)]
*  And it's like we're just supposed to accept that there's nothing that can be done. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2809.08s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do now? There's tents. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2813.6800000000003s)]
*  Now, what did you do? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2816.12s)]
*  What did what did the what the fuck did you neglect [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2817.48s)]
*  that you let these people camp out on streets? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2819.88s)]
*  Why would you let that happen ever? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2821.96s)]
*  You know, and is it encouraging them if you do let them do that? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2824.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2828.28s)]
*  But I know there's a lot of them and you're letting them do it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2829.44s)]
*  It seems like there's more all the time. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2831.4s)]
*  And you're letting them do it. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2832.56s)]
*  And there used to be none. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2833.2400000000002s)]
*  There used to be no tents anywhere. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2834.52s)]
*  So tell me what the fuck you're doing. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2835.92s)]
*  Well, we have a very comprehensive homeless outreach program [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2837.6800000000003s)]
*  that doesn't do jack shit. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2841.8s)]
*  You know, we we ran a little my friend, Colion Noir, is a lawyer. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2844.1600000000003s)]
*  And he was in San Francisco talking to them about it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2847.64s)]
*  And he was like, what is the problem here? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2850.36s)]
*  Is it a lack of funding? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2852.44s)]
*  And this guy was talking, he goes, no, no, the opposite. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2853.92s)]
*  The people that are on these homeless commissions, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2857.44s)]
*  they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2860.64s)]
*  So he shows this list to us of all the people in L.A. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2863.52s)]
*  that are making money, that are supposed to be managing the homeless. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2866.68s)]
*  So over making a quarter million dollars a year. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2869.92s)]
*  And they're out there. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2872.4s)]
*  Well, we're doing our best to outreach and give them safe crackpipes. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  Like it's madness. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2877.9199999999996s)]
*  It's completely. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2879.9199999999996s)]
*  There was no understanding of the situation. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2880.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, not only that, they have no incentive. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2883.08s)]
*  The people that are running it, if the homeless problem goes away, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2885.2799999999997s)]
*  they don't have a job anymore. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2887.7999999999997s)]
*  So what are they going to do? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2889.3599999999997s)]
*  They're going to make sure it's manageable. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2890.52s)]
*  And while we need more funding, we're very close to cracking this problem. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2892.48s)]
*  We're going to need more funding. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2895.9199999999996s)]
*  And they just keep getting more funding. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2897.2799999999997s)]
*  And it has to be addressed like an environmental problem. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2899.04s)]
*  Like if there was a leak, an oil leak in the middle of the street [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2903.04s)]
*  and all those places where the tents were, there was just giant puddles of oil [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2905.88s)]
*  that were coming out of the ground. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2909.1600000000003s)]
*  They would have to deal with that. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2910.56s)]
*  They would go, we have an environment of environmental issue. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2911.6s)]
*  It's real. It's getting into the water supply. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2914.28s)]
*  It's poisoning. We can fix it. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2916.56s)]
*  But it's going to take a lot of resources and time. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2918.12s)]
*  But we're going to do it. Yeah. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=2919.6800000000003s)]

*  They just bled people out. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3257.0s)]
*  And meanwhile, these big giant stores, they just made more and more money [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3258.92s)]
*  because they're the only places you can go. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3262.08s)]
*  And they told people their job was essential or non-essential. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3263.92s)]
*  Like, who the fuck are you? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3267.52s)]
*  Guess what's non-essential? You. You. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3269.0s)]
*  You fucking halfwit telling people what they can and can't do based on what? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3272.92s)]
*  Not even no debating the science of it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3277.76s)]
*  No real conversations with experts at a disagreeing opinions. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3280.36s)]
*  It was gross, man. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3284.88s)]
*  I was happy to get out of there. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3286.6800000000003s)]
*  And we wonder why there's so many cities. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3287.84s)]
*  You know, that Gavin Newsom guy's running for president. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3290.1600000000003s)]
*  He's already started campaigning. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3294.28s)]
*  He's already started campaigning without campaigning. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3296.36s)]
*  He just did Sean Hannity and he's [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3298.2400000000002s)]
*  ringing up California talking about how great California is. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3301.0s)]
*  Every day, I think about leaving, but it's it's still home. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3304.52s)]
*  You know, I tell people, you know, when they say, well, you still you still. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3307.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I love my I love it's home. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3311.24s)]
*  And that's what it is. And that's the hard part. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3314.52s)]
*  Maybe you're even though I'm a traveling comic. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3316.68s)]
*  You know, yeah, I know. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3318.3999999999996s)]
*  I say, yeah, it's like coming every now and then with like a fully armored [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3320.08s)]
*  armada and just block everything down. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3324.0s)]
*  You know, and I got my my little sanctuary that I've worked on [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3328.12s)]
*  for so many years to make my little my my. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3333.6s)]
*  Exactly. I like it. Yeah. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3337.44s)]
*  And it's like, oh, you know. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3338.68s)]
*  But then I see that at the end of the year, when I'm getting taxed, I'm like, oh, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3341.68s)]
*  like the tax alone would pay for everything in Texas. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3345.64s)]
*  Those tax people are so silly. They want so much money. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3349.12s)]
*  I wish it was going somewhere. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3352.96s)]
*  I wish it was going something really good. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3354.24s)]
*  Like if the taxes were very high, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3355.68s)]
*  but then you look at the quality of life that you get from it [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3358.68s)]
*  and you're like, wow, they do an amazing job with all this tax money. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3361.2799999999997s)]
*  Now they do a terrible job. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3364.04s)]
*  It's fucking overrun with bureaucracy and too many people and nothing gets fixed [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3366.2s)]
*  and nothing gets done. It's like, blah. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3370.64s)]
*  Yeah, I still see the potholes. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3373.16s)]
*  I had. Yeah, that's a minor. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3374.52s)]
*  That's minor. The homelessness is the biggest one. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3377.04s)]
*  Like that is bonkers that you you think you are doing your job. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3379.36s)]
*  If you're you are governing a city that has a hundred [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3383.44s)]
*  thousand homeless people or whatever it is. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3387.08s)]
*  What do we say to 65? They guess they're guessing. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3389.08s)]
*  They're guessing they ain't doing a fucking survey. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3392.96s)]
*  Now you're here all the time. What is it like here? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3395.72s)]
*  It's nothing very there's homeless people. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3397.92s)]
*  There's almost people in every city, but there's way less. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3400.16s)]
*  And they cleaned up all the tents around the city every now and then. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3402.56s)]
*  They pop up under the bridge, but they clean them up and then they come back [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3405.08s)]
*  and then they clean them up and they come back. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3407.92s)]
*  But at least they clean them up. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3409.36s)]
*  At least they don't allow them to accumulate and become like a village [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3410.7599999999998s)]
*  like San Francisco, where is it like San Francisco? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3413.64s)]
*  Essentially, they have these open air drug dens. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3416.48s)]
*  Michael Schellenberger wrote a great book about it called San Francisco. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3419.12s)]
*  And he talks about how these progressive policies are just destroying these cities. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3422.56s)]
*  It's like you have to make a correction and they're not making a correction. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3426.7599999999998s)]
*  So what are you going to do? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3430.44s)]
*  I wish I had the answer for that. Yeah. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3433.88s)]
*  When you go on the road, you go on the road for just weekends [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3437.36s)]
*  or do you do like long stretches? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3439.24s)]
*  I guess it depends on if it's a big tour. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3441.2s)]
*  Like right now, I'm just doing nothing but clubs. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3443.92s)]
*  It's like, you know, after the Dodger Stadium show. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3446.24s)]
*  Nice. My agent and my manager wanted me to to ride the wave of the success [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3448.8799999999997s)]
*  of the special and go back and tour hard. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3454.04s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I want to I want to just pump the brakes for a little bit. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3456.56s)]
*  I want to remind myself why I love this so much. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3461.96s)]
*  So I said, I just want to do nothing but clubs for at least half a year. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3464.3599999999997s)]
*  And so just doing shows, you know, I'll still do, you know, my four sets a week [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3468.04s)]
*  because I was doing, you know, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3472.64s)]
*  But now I'm just doing it at one place [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3475.48s)]
*  and then doing two shows Friday, two shows Saturday. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3477.64s)]
*  You know, so I get my sets in and go home. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3480.68s)]
*  And yeah, I'm not making the same money, but the peace of mind is incredible. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3483.8s)]
*  You know, I'm not stressing about money. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3487.56s)]
*  I'm not stressing about paying for these tour buses or paying for the rigs [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3488.92s)]
*  or paying for the production. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3492.32s)]
*  You know, what's going on at the end of the night at the arena? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3493.88s)]
*  I mean, there's so much that goes into it. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3496.48s)]
*  And to be able to just walk into a club and focus on [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3498.56s)]
*  let me just be funny and have fun. Yeah. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3501.28s)]
*  You know, so it's a great way to write a new hour, too. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3503.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and I love the fact that when I'm doing these clubs, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3506.44s)]
*  everybody's a lot more excited. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3511.76s)]
*  First of all, the staff is incredible. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3513.6000000000004s)]
*  No matter where I'm going, everybody's been super great. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3515.28s)]
*  And the crowds have been super appreciative that they can watch [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3517.7200000000003s)]
*  an intimate show like that, because even if you're sitting in the back row [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3520.76s)]
*  of the club, you know, at an arena, that's like row three. Right. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3524.0800000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? And so it's, you know, it's been a lot of fun. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3527.28s)]
*  And I've enjoyed it. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3530.1200000000003s)]
*  And it reminded me how much I love this, because I think at a certain point [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3530.96s)]
*  I became a hoe. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3536.5600000000004s)]
*  I became a hoe and it became more about the money. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3538.32s)]
*  Because, dude, once the money started coming, it's like you get scared [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3541.0400000000004s)]
*  because it's so much and it's coming at you from all these different angles. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3544.8s)]
*  And you're having these meetings and they're going over your portfolio [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3548.8s)]
*  and you got to invest this and we got to do that and blah, blah, blah. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3551.88s)]
*  And you're like, oh, my God. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3554.76s)]
*  And now, you know, I have employees and I had employees. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3556.4s)]
*  And now I employ like 30 people, which is insane. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3559.88s)]
*  You know, and if I stop working, they all stop working. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3563.12s)]
*  So then it turns into this thing where, you know, you you feel almost [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3566.36s)]
*  like you're obligated to work even more to take care of everybody else. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3570.92s)]
*  That's Bert Kreischer. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3574.92s)]
*  So when I told my team, I want to do clubs for half a year, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3577.7599999999998s)]
*  they were not happy about it. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3583.0s)]
*  And they're like, you're missing out. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3584.08s)]
*  You really this you got to strike while they're missing out. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3585.44s)]
*  And they're missing out. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3588.84s)]
*  They're not that, you know, they see one thing as creatives. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3590.04s)]
*  It's very different. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3593.68s)]
*  Yeah, but they have to like not give you creative advice. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3594.64s)]
*  That's very important. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3599.36s)]
*  But that's not creative advice. It's it's financial. Right. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3600.32s)]
*  But it's great. But creative for you is I need to fill my creative void. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3603.36s)]
*  I want to go out there and fuck around. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3608.64s)]
*  I want to have a good time. That's the creative aspect of when you're doing [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3610.56s)]
*  a show, you got a show. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3613.04s)]
*  There's 15000 people in there. It's a show. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3614.8s)]
*  It's a different kind of thing. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3617.32s)]
*  You're not going to like really write in front of 15000 people. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3618.68s)]
*  You write and fuck around in front of a small crowd. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3621.7999999999997s)]
*  Like it's a creative choice. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3623.96s)]
*  And they're wrong anyway. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3625.9199999999996s)]
*  Like you ain't getting off that wave, son. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3627.3199999999997s)]
*  You don't have to worry about that wave. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3630.0s)]
*  Ride in the wave. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3631.48s)]
*  You'll be on that wave to the rest of your life. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3632.6s)]
*  You don't have to worry about that wave. Thank you. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3634.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You don't have to worry about that wave at all. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3637.16s)]
*  They can relax. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3638.68s)]
*  You could take a year off and get off fucking Instagram or Twitter [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3640.3999999999996s)]
*  and just vanish for a year and come back and crush it. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3643.44s)]
*  It doesn't matter. You can do whatever the fuck you want. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3646.08s)]
*  That was the one thing about COVID is it is I had never taken a break [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3648.52s)]
*  that long from comedy ever. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3652.3199999999997s)]
*  It's amazing how much energy you have when you have to work every night. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3654.48s)]
*  Yeah. It's very you can actually get on a schedule. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3656.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, for me, I've always dealt with the weight issue. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3660.2s)]
*  It's always been a thing for me. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3663.2799999999997s)]
*  But being home for a year and actually being able to focus [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3664.72s)]
*  and I had a trainer and everything, I was able to lose 70 pounds. Nice. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3669.04s)]
*  See all the doctors that I've been avoiding [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3672.44s)]
*  because I've been on the road. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3675.3199999999997s)]
*  I actually got to go see everybody and find out how I was doing. Yeah. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3676.3599999999997s)]
*  So I felt like it was it was helpful. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3680.2799999999997s)]
*  I never take time off ever. I work all the time. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3681.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm on the road 46 weeks out of the year. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3685.56s)]
*  Well, you always have been. That's always been your reputation. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3687.68s)]
*  That's why we were talking about the even at the ice house shows. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3689.9599999999996s)]
*  Crazy. The two PM kids show. Yeah. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3694.4799999999996s)]
*  Ridiculous. Nobody does that. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3697.6s)]
*  Nobody has four shows in a day. That's insane. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3699.4799999999996s)]
*  And I used to do I used to do the shows. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3702.12s)]
*  And then as soon as I get off stage, I go outside and do a full blown [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3703.96s)]
*  meet and greet. So I would meet every single like do the show, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3706.52s)]
*  do a meet and greet. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3710.16s)]
*  And then by the time the meet and greet was over, it was time for me [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3710.88s)]
*  to go back up on stage. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3713.32s)]
*  Hmm. Oh, my God. So I was doing that. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3714.52s)]
*  You know, I was doing that every week forever. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3717.12s)]
*  But I think that's also what helped to build, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3719.4s)]
*  build everything up. 100 percent. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3722.2400000000002s)]
*  100 percent. You're you're engaging with people. You're you know. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3723.84s)]
*  Yeah. Real grassroots. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3727.08s)]
*  You were really getting out there and hanging out. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3728.44s)]
*  We used to always do that at the ice house, have those meet and greets afterwards. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3730.28s)]
*  Hang out, talk to people. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3733.2s)]
*  That's a great club. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3734.68s)]
*  That set up back there is amazing. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3735.76s)]
*  Just a little. Have you been there recently? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3737.36s)]
*  No, I haven't. I haven't been when it's remodeled. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3738.96s)]
*  The buses that did an amazing job with it. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3741.92s)]
*  It's it's very modern. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3744.36s)]
*  Part of it is like they killed certain things. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3746.2s)]
*  It kind of made it the club club where now it feels a little bit more. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3749.2s)]
*  It's too corporate. It's too clean. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3753.28s)]
*  I don't know why they would fuck with it. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3755.88s)]
*  It was literally perfect. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3757.24s)]
*  There's a skybox in the back of the room. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3758.4s)]
*  Literally a skybox in the back of the room. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3760.88s)]
*  And if it's the room for the comics to chill in, it's bad. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3763.0s)]
*  As is the greatest green room ever. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3766.8s)]
*  But it's now considered a VIP room in the back. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3768.48s)]
*  And there's like a glass like a like. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3772.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's a place where people could just talk. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3773.8s)]
*  Yeah. While you're on stage. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3775.96s)]
*  Talk or you just you know. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3777.2000000000003s)]
*  That's what it looks like back there. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3778.6800000000003s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3780.2400000000002s)]
*  So the room. I remember that room. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3781.52s)]
*  So they just basically opened that room up because it used to be that room was closed off. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3783.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So it's not like the room's any smaller. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3787.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no. The room is the same size. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3789.68s)]
*  And you know, it's still it's still fun. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3791.52s)]
*  It's still fun to perform in there. It's just very different. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3793.8399999999997s)]
*  And as somebody that spent years going there to all of a sudden see, you know, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3796.24s)]
*  you enter through the front through the street, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3800.72s)]
*  whereas before you'd enter through the alley. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3803.2s)]
*  Oh, interesting. You know, and then the bar. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3805.04s)]
*  I mean, everything just looks really, really nice. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3807.68s)]
*  They they they changed it. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3809.8399999999997s)]
*  But I feel like if you're the oldest club in the country, man, you got to look like, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3811.24s)]
*  you know, a little bit more classic. Yeah. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3816.0s)]
*  Old school. A lot of the changes. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3818.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, man, a skybox, a weird choice, but whatever. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3819.6000000000004s)]
*  Maybe it works. Like I said, it was that was just a closed off room before. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3823.32s)]
*  Mm hmm. You know, remember, you wouldn't even be able to see the stage. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3826.6000000000004s)]
*  It was like mirrors back there. No, it was just the little wall. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3829.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And then the room behind it was like a dining. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3832.0s)]
*  What did they do with the little room? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3834.96s)]
*  They had that little room. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3836.48s)]
*  So the little room, they actually made the little room bigger [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3837.52s)]
*  and they're making it so that they can have jazz and live music. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3840.1200000000003s)]
*  It actually looks really cool. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3844.1600000000003s)]
*  But again, it's not it's not the old ice house. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3845.56s)]
*  Right. It's not the old house. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3848.72s)]
*  So this is no more nostalgia. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3851.92s)]
*  It's everything's new, clean and just pretty. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3854.6s)]
*  Well, listen, I'm just happy that someone dumped a bunch of money into it. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3857.2799999999997s)]
*  Fixed it and finally reopened and wants good comedy there. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3859.72s)]
*  Yeah. Are they doing like headliners on the weekend? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3863.48s)]
*  How are they doing? Are they doing it like? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3866.52s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's I don't think it's set up as like a showcase, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3868.7999999999997s)]
*  like like Melrose or in the other clubs and stuff. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3871.56s)]
*  It's definitely headliners on the weekend. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3874.68s)]
*  Yeah, there's when you're talking about like outside of L.A., there's Pasadena. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3877.76s)]
*  There's Comedy Magic. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3883.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a few other there's always like Irvine, but then you're far out. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3885.4s)]
*  Now you're going pretty far, you know, and those clubs are definitely headliners. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3889.4s)]
*  Yeah, there's not there. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3893.56s)]
*  No, there's no like real comedy comedy clubs [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3894.48s)]
*  or where showcase clubs are outside of the city, right? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3896.7200000000003s)]
*  Mm hmm. Not really. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3899.2400000000002s)]
*  Once you get past like the haha, you know, what else you got? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3900.64s)]
*  You know, I mean, I was at Flappers a couple of weeks ago. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3904.36s)]
*  That was fun. Again, you know, these these rooms and it's just like, wow. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3907.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it was so much fun. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3911.92s)]
*  Just went out there and had a good time. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3913.92s)]
*  Yeah. Flappers is a great room, but it's a weird room. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3915.7200000000003s)]
*  Like where whenever I would go there, I'm like, who are you guys? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3917.7200000000003s)]
*  Like, I don't know any of you. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3921.2400000000002s)]
*  And now it's just one owner. It's Barbara. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3922.84s)]
*  Oh, I mean, the comics. Oh, OK. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3925.2000000000003s)]
*  Because I'm sorry. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3926.6800000000003s)]
*  A lot of the comics like where else you guys work? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3927.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, I never see you anywhere. It's weird. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3929.1200000000003s)]
*  There was like a specific group that was always at Flappers. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3931.0s)]
*  I was like, this is a strange little group of people. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3933.72s)]
*  You know, people find their little clicks. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3935.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. I was going to say it's like back in the day, you knew everybody. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3937.3199999999997s)]
*  You knew who was doing it and you knew where they were at. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3940.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And now it's like I open my I blink. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3943.9199999999996s)]
*  There's 10 more comics. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3946.8399999999997s)]
*  It's like, wow, there's so many blame podcasts. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3948.04s)]
*  Yeah, nice. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3951.9199999999996s)]
*  That's what it is. So many people listen to podcasts like, damn, I want to do that. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3952.8799999999997s)]
*  Sounds like fun. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3956.04s)]
*  You think you think of it like also you hear the people on podcasts. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3957.24s)]
*  These guys are kind of stupid. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3959.8399999999997s)]
*  I think I could do it better than them. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3961.3199999999997s)]
*  That's always I think I can do better than them. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3962.96s)]
*  Yeah, always. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3964.76s)]

*  Mm hmm. Yeah. And then they're like, oh, I can do that. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3968.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the problem is like think about what you do. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3970.44s)]
*  You go up there and you talk. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3972.52s)]
*  Well, everybody can talk. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3973.92s)]
*  Like, it's confusing. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3975.76s)]
*  So like a person in the audience, like I could talk to how can he gets to talk? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3977.2000000000003s)]
*  And I don't get to talk. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3980.76s)]
*  Like you start thinking that you could do what they do. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3982.0s)]
*  That's why it's hilarious when you see someone try to go on stage [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3984.28s)]
*  and talk to an audience that's drunk. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3986.6800000000003s)]
*  Like you think you can go up here and do it. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3988.48s)]
*  And they go, yeah. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3990.28s)]
*  And they get up there and they like freeze like a deer in the headlights. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3991.0s)]
*  And then they realize like how weird it is. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3994.04s)]
*  Yeah. But when someone like you is relaxed and on stage, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3996.08s)]
*  it seems like he's just talking. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=3999.4s)]
*  I can just talk to. Mm hmm. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4000.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's easier than it looks. Yeah. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4003.24s)]
*  I mean, I feel fortunate that when I'm on stage, I actually feel more comfortable [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4005.2s)]
*  on stage. Like, I feel like there's nothing I can't do when I'm up there. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4009.16s)]
*  Well, you're heightened. Right. Yeah. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4013.04s)]
*  Because also you've been doing it so long. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4014.8s)]
*  And you're super confident you're going to kill. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4016.8s)]
*  So you get up there. It's like, yeah. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4018.76s)]
*  It's it's an extra superpower. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4020.24s)]
*  And for some reason, like if if and then having the eyes, too. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4021.9199999999996s)]
*  So it's like if like, for example, one on one, it's like, hey, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4025.52s)]
*  can you do 20 pushups? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4030.56s)]
*  Probably not. But put me in front of a crowd and put the pressure on me. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4032.04s)]
*  Right. You know, for some reason, I'm going to find a way to do it. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4035.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to, you know, find a way to, you know, you know, I'm a big dude. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4038.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's like, you know, I'm not very agile, but on stage for some reason, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4042.12s)]
*  I can run on stage. Mm hmm. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4045.24s)]
*  You know, yeah. Adrenaline. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4047.56s)]
*  It's I feel like there's nothing I can't do when I'm up there. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4049.12s)]
*  But then as soon as I get off the stage, I go back to, you know, deflate. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4052.24s)]
*  You said you you lost a lot of weight. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4057.6s)]
*  What did you do in terms of your diet? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4059.3599999999997s)]
*  You know what? I was very consistent. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4062.04s)]
*  I was able to eat, you know, and have a plan like, you know, I had breakfast. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4064.04s)]
*  I'd have lunch. I'd have dinner. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4069.3599999999997s)]
*  Whereas before God, I was always on the road. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4070.68s)]
*  So it's like I never wanted to eat before I went up on stage [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4072.88s)]
*  because then it would mess with like a heartburn. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4075.8399999999997s)]
*  And you don't want to be burping or farting in front of a crowd. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4077.76s)]
*  So I wait until the end. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4080.84s)]
*  And then by the time the show's over, what's available to eat? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4081.76s)]
*  You know, it's terrible food. Terrible. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4085.0400000000004s)]
*  And you're starving. Yes. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4086.5200000000004s)]
*  You can't wait to eat. Yeah. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4087.88s)]
*  And then go to sleep. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4089.1600000000003s)]
*  And then it was just that cycle repeat. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4090.0800000000004s)]
*  And it just, you know, over the years, man, it got good to me. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4092.1600000000003s)]
*  So I gained all that weight. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4094.84s)]
*  So being home for a year, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4095.96s)]
*  you know, I was having an actual regular clean breakfast, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4098.360000000001s)]
*  you know, nothing crazy from the road. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4102.24s)]
*  It was all food that was store bought and preparing my own food. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4104.360000000001s)]
*  You can get like a meal prep company that will make meals for you [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4107.28s)]
*  that are like I've done. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4110.48s)]
*  Yeah, I've done those. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4111.759999999999s)]
*  And how that work? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4112.8s)]
*  I was into it for a couple of weeks, but then it's like, oh, man, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4114.04s)]
*  I'm tired of fucking broccoli. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4116.2s)]
*  Tired of this shit. Yeah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4119.32s)]
*  What helped out a lot, too, was that, you know, I was every day [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4123.32s)]
*  I was walking a lot, you know, I was lifting weights three times a week. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4125.84s)]
*  Well, that's great. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4130.28s)]
*  And then again, going to see my doctors getting on certain plans like, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4130.92s)]
*  you know, I wear a monitor now for my sugar, you know, so I'm always [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4134.919999999999s)]
*  I'm able to keep tabs on my sugar, whereas before it was out of control. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4138.839999999999s)]
*  You know, I was I was averaging waking up at 400, which is like [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4143.16s)]
*  you might as well. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4146.919999999999s)]
*  Normal you want to be somewhere between 80 and 120, at least for me. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4148.24s)]
*  And so, yeah, it was I was writing [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4153.16s)]
*  what they say the the check engine light on too long. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4156.24s)]
*  That's scary. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4160.08s)]
*  And so, you know, and then I got high blood pressure. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4160.44s)]
*  And of course, you know, you don't know it until they tell you [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4163.0s)]
*  or until you, you know, check yourself. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4165.72s)]
*  So then getting on medication for that, getting on medication for diabetes. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4167.32s)]
*  And, you know, now I'm selling Jody. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4170.8s)]
*  Yeah, you got a cock suck. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4173.04s)]
*  You got to get the diabetes. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4174.04s)]
*  You got to listen that. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4175.2s)]
*  But getting my health in order with the doctor and with the food [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4176.8s)]
*  and with the working out, whereas I wasn't able to do that on the road. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4181.36s)]
*  Or I would make a lot more excuses because I didn't, you know. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4186.92s)]
*  Well, also, you want to have energy for those shows. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4189.88s)]
*  And sometimes when you work out really hard after it's over, you're so tired. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4192.5599999999995s)]
*  And when you're really tired, it's hard to like fire back up [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4196.32s)]
*  to get ready for the shows, especially if it's a new thing you're doing. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4198.68s)]
*  You know, if your body's adapted to it, you can do it pretty easy. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4201.88s)]
*  But if your body's not adapted to it, like a hard workout, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4205.04s)]
*  it's like, what the fuck is this? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4207.72s)]
*  And all my energy goes into the show. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4210.16s)]
*  So when I'm up there, I'm hitting it, hitting it, hitting it. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4212.32s)]
*  You know, I'm not sluggish. I'm not standing still. Right. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4214.8s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm not seeing a performance like. Yeah. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4217.88s)]
*  But then when I get off. Yeah. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4221.759999999999s)]
*  The thing is, if you did get healthy and you did get in shape, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4224.96s)]
*  it would really genuinely help your ability to maintain that. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4227.48s)]
*  Because, I mean, just imagine if you said you lost 70 pounds. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4231.32s)]
*  Imagine if you had to do your show right now with a 70 pound vest on. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4234.28s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it sucks. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4237.639999999999s)]
*  And that's the reality of weight. Yeah. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4239.92s)]
*  That's the reality of gravity. My knees, my hips, everything. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4242.2s)]
*  Just everything. Breathing harder. Yeah. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4244.96s)]
*  I do workouts with a 25 pound vest on [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4247.2s)]
*  and just a 25 pound vest on just 25 pounds. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4249.84s)]
*  It's not even that much. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4252.24s)]
*  Like if you pick up 25 pounds, doesn't seem like much. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4252.96s)]
*  That 25 pound vest makes a giant difference. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4255.84s)]
*  Do everything with that vest on. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4258.5599999999995s)]
*  And everything's way harder. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4260.44s)]
*  Farmers carries chin ups, push ups, dips, body weight squats. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4262.16s)]
*  Everything's harder with just 25 pounds. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4265.84s)]
*  People gain and lose 25 pounds like it's nothing. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4268.28s)]
*  But when you're walking around with that 25 pounds on, that is just [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4270.88s)]
*  you're carrying that man. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4274.28s)]
*  That's a lot of burden on your resources, your biological resources, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4276.76s)]
*  your tissue, your bones, your joints, your hip, your back. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4281.72s)]
*  You're you just fatigue, you know, and then maybe the writing that you do. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4286.280000000001s)]
*  Maybe writing would be sharper. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4291.04s)]
*  Maybe you'd have more that you were thinking about [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4293.92s)]
*  if you had more pumping through your body. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4295.88s)]
*  You know, oh, believe me, it's it's I agree 100 percent [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4298.0s)]
*  with everything that you're saying. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4301.320000000001s)]
*  And it's not even it's not even a an issue of not knowing [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  or not understanding or not seeing the bigger picture. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4306.24s)]
*  I got to get you an Adderall and Ozempic. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4308.5199999999995s)]
*  Nice. Let's go. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4310.48s)]
*  I just got on Ozempic. Did you? Oh, yeah. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4311.76s)]
*  Well, you want to hear something funny? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4314.12s)]
*  They I got approached by Ozempic early on before they had the fucking song. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4315.36s)]
*  Oh, boy. What's the song? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4319.92s)]
*  I didn't know they have a song. Oh, oh, oh, oh, Zempic. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4321.96s)]
*  It's based on that old song. Yeah. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4326.08s)]
*  Oh, it's magic. That song. Yeah. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4327.84s)]
*  And so they approached me and they wanted me to be their their spokesperson [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4329.5599999999995s)]
*  for Ozempic. Yeah. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4334.0s)]
*  And, you know, we took a meeting and everything. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4335.72s)]
*  And I mean, you know, I appreciated the fact that they actually approached [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4338.0s)]
*  the diabetic to be the spokesperson. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4340.84s)]
*  I just diabetes medicine. Yeah. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4343.360000000001s)]
*  I'm going to be the new Wilford Brimley, you know. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4345.280000000001s)]
*  And so it just the deal didn't work out. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4348.360000000001s)]
*  But you're still doing it. So you're on it. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4351.84s)]
*  How much? What's funny is I wasn't on it when I took the meeting. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4353.6s)]
*  And, you know, it wasn't like I said, when 2020 hit, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4357.280000000001s)]
*  and I went to go see my doctor, he goes, I'm going to put you on this thing [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4359.92s)]
*  called Ozempic. I'm like, are you freaking kidding me? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4363.0s)]
*  I'm like, I could have been getting that shit for free. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4365.76s)]
*  But yeah, so it's once I, you know, give myself the shot once a week. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4369.8s)]
*  Some people use it to lose weight, you know, like, like, you know, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4372.92s)]
*  people that aren't necessarily really big. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4375.76s)]
*  Yes. We'll use that to, you know, suppress their appetite and stuff like that, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4378.96s)]
*  because it will make you a little nauseous. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4382.08s)]
*  Like in the mornings, I wake up and I'm like, oh, I got to drink like a shake. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4385.52s)]
*  Or so you only do it once a week when people are on it for weight loss. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4388.12s)]
*  Do they do it like every day? Like how often they do it? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4391.52s)]
*  I don't know what the cycle is for using Ozempic for weight loss, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4393.48s)]
*  but I just know that when I first did it, I dropped 15 pounds like in, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4398.2s)]
*  God, like a week. Wow. Yeah. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4401.879999999999s)]
*  So your body will react to it immediately. But then, of course, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4404.36s)]
*  you plateau and stuff like that. They say that it limits your appetite. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4407.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what that's one of the big effects of it. Yeah. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4410.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was I was waking up queasy. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4414.2s)]
*  And so, you know, you can feel a little nauseous. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4415.959999999999s)]
*  You're not really trying to. It's crazy because it's everywhere. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4417.599999999999s)]
*  Like you see all these ads for it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4419.639999999999s)]
*  And even like Tony Hinchcliffe brought this up, like CNN had a thing on it [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4421.32s)]
*  that it seems like a story, but it kind of is an ad. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4425.24s)]
*  You know, it's kind of an ad for Ozempic, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4428.799999999999s)]
*  but it seems like it's a story about Hollywood celebrities. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4430.679999999999s)]
*  But really just jazzing up the fact that everybody's taking Ozempic. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4433.0s)]
*  Like it seems like there's something more going on there [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4436.28s)]
*  other than just just Ozempic. Yeah. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4439.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Like you're you probably got paid to do that. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4441.5599999999995s)]
*  That story, you know, because I'm telling you, I take it every week. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4444.0s)]
*  And that initial first hit of the weight loss. Yeah, it's true. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4447.5599999999995s)]
*  But it doesn't at least it didn't continue for me. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4451.56s)]
*  How often do people take Ozempic when they're trying to lose weight, Jamie? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4454.6s)]
*  It's not once a week thing. It's still once a week. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4457.52s)]
*  It's like also tapering off, I think. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4459.8s)]
*  Or yeah, or maybe it gets higher. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4462.0s)]
*  I think maybe it's actually ramping up the dosage, you know, like you start [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4464.96s)]
*  well, it's like point to five units up to like one. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4469.16s)]
*  But there's supposed to be a time where you're supposed to get off of it. Right. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4471.72s)]
*  As far as like for if you're trying to cut weight with it, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4476.4s)]
*  I think the cut weight people. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4478.72s)]
*  It's supposed to push that a cycle like you're supposed to do. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4480.48s)]
*  Yeah. You're 10, 12 weeks on, probably 12 weeks off. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4482.839999999999s)]
*  These motherfuckers are pushing that. Right. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4484.959999999999s)]
*  But it does help regulate my sugar. Yeah. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4486.639999999999s)]
*  So I do I between the monitor because my monitor is always checking my sugar. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4488.639999999999s)]
*  So, for example, right now, I don't have the monitor with me. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4493.0s)]
*  It's in the car because the honey, the honey, the honey spikes my sugar [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4497.12s)]
*  like like nothing else. Sure. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4501.24s)]
*  But because my voice is a little off right now, so I'm taking the honey. Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4502.44s)]
*  So do you watch like sugar like bread? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4507.32s)]
*  You start you cut that stuff out after a while. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4509.8s)]
*  You start knowing exactly what does what. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4512.320000000001s)]
*  So you already know like, oh, I can eat that. I shouldn't. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4514.68s)]
*  And then, you know, you see things and you're like, all right, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4517.4400000000005s)]
*  this is going to set it off. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4519.8s)]
*  So I also have my I take insulin. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4520.84s)]
*  Oh, OK. So I'm trying to play that game. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4524.4400000000005s)]
*  How long have you been doing that? [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4527.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, God, over five years, for sure. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4529.240000000001s)]
*  So is this type two diabetes? Yes. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4531.12s)]
*  So that's the type that you can reverse with diet and exercise. Yes. Yeah. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4533.360000000001s)]
*  And again, it's not for lack of knowing. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4539.12s)]
*  I already know. I get it, bro. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4540.879999999999s)]
*  And that's what sucks. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4542.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like I feel like everything that I've ever attempted to do [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4543.36s)]
*  for my career, I've been able to do. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4548.32s)]
*  But for myself, my personal self, losing weight has been the hardest thing, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4551.639999999999s)]
*  the hardest thing in the world. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4556.08s)]
*  Somebody explain it to me. And it makes a lot of sense. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4557.599999999999s)]
*  One of the reasons why food addictions are the hardest to stop [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4559.44s)]
*  is because you still have to eat food. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4562.4s)]
*  Whereas, like, say, if you had a gambling addiction [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4564.679999999999s)]
*  and you went and got counseling and you stayed out of the casinos [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4567.2s)]
*  and now you don't think about it anymore, you don't have to gamble every day. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4570.12s)]
*  But you have to eat every day. Yes. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4574.56s)]
*  So if you have an addiction to food and then you're eating fucking celery [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4576.0s)]
*  with a little bit of peanut butter on it, like, what is this? Exactly. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4580.4s)]
*  And while I would just eat the peanut butter, I'd eat the peanut butter off the celery. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4583.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's just it's hard. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4587.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a very difficult one because the fact that you have to engage [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4590.4800000000005s)]
*  in the same activity that you're addicted to, which is eating. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4593.56s)]
*  You have to in order to stay alive. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4596.92s)]
*  You know, and then you hear words like, oh, moderation. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4598.8s)]
*  Oh, you just got to be, you know, be more mindful. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4600.88s)]
*  You got to. I'm like, oh, well, it's like everybody's got. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4603.28s)]
*  It's a feeling. It is. It is like a drug. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4606.24s)]
*  It's like you're eating the. Oh, God, you're eating some pasta. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4608.04s)]
*  It's like, oh, you just you feel good. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4610.2s)]
*  You're sitting there. Oh, it's just it's it's not just the eating part. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4612.4800000000005s)]
*  It's how you feel when you're 100 percent. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4616.16s)]
*  That is all Italian food is for me. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4618.84s)]
*  I mean, it's the feeling of it. It's like the oh, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4621.16s)]
*  when you're all sitting around drinking red wine, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4624.92s)]
*  I know I'm going to feel like dog shit in like an hour later. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4626.56s)]
*  But at that time, at that moment, it's worth it. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4629.64s)]
*  But it's just only worth it for me, like once in a blue moon. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4632.120000000001s)]
*  When I eat like that all the time, I get fat. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4635.68s)]
*  I my my I just like get slower. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4638.4400000000005s)]
*  My my brain doesn't work as well. You foggy. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4642.88s)]
*  Yeah, I get foggy. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4645.6s)]
*  And it's so easy to gain weight. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4647.240000000001s)]
*  It's so easy to keep eating when you're eating like bread and pasta. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4648.84s)]
*  I could just overeat pasta to the end of time. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4652.6s)]
*  Like I'm done eating, but I still want more like I just more than stuff. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4655.96s)]
*  And I'm still like twirling my fork in that spaghetti. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4660.6s)]
*  And for me, bread, bread is the biggest crack. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4666.56s)]
*  And I got bread. Oh. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4669.08s)]
*  And then they come over with some tiramisu. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4670.6s)]
*  You're like, fuck it. I'm in. Nice. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4672.160000000001s)]
*  You're already stuffed. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4673.68s)]
*  You can't even eat any more spaghetti and you're just down in tiramisu. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4674.88s)]
*  Yeah, I've had some very high calorie meals. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4678.360000000001s)]
*  But as long as I allow myself to do that every now and again, I'm good. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4681.92s)]
*  So for what I do is I almost entirely meat. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4686.16s)]
*  That's my most of my diet. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4690.36s)]
*  High protein diet. Yes. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4691.719999999999s)]
*  I'm on what's called a carnivore diet. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4693.0s)]
*  I'll have a piece of fruit every now and again. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4695.0s)]
*  But that's kind of it. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4697.2s)]
*  I mean, a little piece of lettuce. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4698.92s)]
*  I've cheated a couple of times. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4700.32s)]
*  I had an acai bowl the other day, but it's rare. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4701.759999999999s)]
*  Mostly I'm just and I feel great when I eat like this. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4705.04s)]
*  I just feel I lose weight. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4707.88s)]
*  I get lighter and I'm more clear headed, which is very strange. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4710.2s)]
*  I think it's because your your body starts processing ketones. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4713.72s)]
*  Your brain starts processing ketones instead of carbohydrates. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4717.599999999999s)]
*  Anytime I've had successful weight loss, it's always because I cut out. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4721.48s)]
*  You know, I went higher on the protein and I cut back on the breads [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  and the pastas and the sugars and stuff. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4727.88s)]
*  We're going to get you a guy. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4729.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to get you a guy. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4731.08s)]
*  Let me get you somebody to fucking say, you're right. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4732.4s)]
*  We're going to do this. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4734.84s)]
*  I want to make it a project. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4736.4s)]
*  I've I've some of the things I've tried. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4737.5599999999995s)]
*  I've actually hired a nutritionist to live with me, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4739.52s)]
*  like a person making me my food. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4742.040000000001s)]
*  And I just got worse and cooking in your house. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4743.56s)]
*  God, yeah. Fuck. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4745.4800000000005s)]
*  I couldn't take it. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4746.52s)]
*  You know what? I choose happiness. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4748.040000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I'd rather be fat. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4750.080000000001s)]
*  If you'd rather choose happiness to the thing is like you can do both. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4752.8s)]
*  You can enjoy food and you can also lose weight and be healthy. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4756.040000000001s)]
*  But you have to do it the right way, you know, and you have to do it [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4760.4400000000005s)]
*  in a way that's sustainable. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4763.0s)]
*  That's what's difficult. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4764.160000000001s)]
*  I keep hearing the word lifestyle. It's a lifestyle. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4765.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4767.52s)]
*  You just got to get addicted to being healthy, right? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4769.360000000001s)]
*  You're addicted to food, you know, and I am, too. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4771.280000000001s)]
*  I get addicted to food. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4774.120000000001s)]
*  But you also can get addicted to being healthy. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4775.240000000001s)]
*  Another thing that happens is when you start eating really healthy, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4778.120000000001s)]
*  especially when you start eating low carbohydrate, high fat, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4780.72s)]
*  high animal fat, animal meat, you your gut biome changes. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4783.64s)]
*  And that starts becoming what you're interested in eating. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4789.400000000001s)]
*  Like your body craves that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4792.6s)]
*  If I eat a lot of sugar and a lot of carbohydrates, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4793.92s)]
*  I just want to eat it all the time. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4796.28s)]
*  I want to eat bread with butter. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4797.44s)]
*  I want to have a sandwich. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4799.04s)]
*  I want to have a bowl of spaghetti or a lasagna or something like that. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4800.24s)]
*  But when I don't eat like that, that's not what I crave. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4803.84s)]
*  Then I crave meat. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4806.44s)]
*  Like that's where I'm at right now. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4808.08s)]
*  So I'm two months in. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4809.44s)]
*  So I just I just trying to eat eggs and meat all the time. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4810.76s)]
*  That's all I'm hungry for. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4814.72s)]
*  And you know what? I've been able to do that for a while, [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4816.08s)]
*  but then I start craving. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4818.56s)]
*  I start craving the bread or tortillas or pasta, rice, rice. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4820.44s)]
*  And it's just like, oh, the problem is Mexican food is so fucking delicious. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4825.04s)]
*  It is amazing. It's so fucking delicious, bro. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4828.84s)]
*  I love me a Mexican restaurant, like one of them hole in the walls [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4833.44s)]
*  that has the Mexican soap operas playing and nobody speaks English. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4838.08s)]
*  You know, you're going to get the real shit. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4841.76s)]
*  There's a place called the Big Burrito. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4843.76s)]
*  And I think it was in. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4845.84s)]
*  It's like right outside of Woodland Hills, where my old studio was. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4849.28s)]
*  And we would go down there, man. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4853.08s)]

*  I used to not blow them up. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4876.52s)]
*  I used to not blow them up because I didn't want to ruin it. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4878.08s)]
*  Now, they sent me a message the other day. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=4880.320000000001s)]

*  But being able to go and like, what, you want to go eat at Ruth Chris Steakhouse and have [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5015.36s)]
*  some baked potatoes and have a steak dipped in butter? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5020.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, let's do it. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5023.719999999999s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5024.719999999999s)]
*  You want to go again? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5025.24s)]
*  Sure. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5026.4s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5026.92s)]
*  And it's just like, dude, at a certain point that becomes a reality and you lose touch [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5028.12s)]
*  with the fact that you're getting it over your head. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5032.28s)]
*  The key to getting you in shape, though, is someone has to do it correctly and they got [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5035.4s)]
*  to do it slow. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5038.92s)]
*  And they got to do it with a heart monitor and they got to do it with a monitor. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5039.92s)]
*  Your heart rate variability, like you should use like a whoop strap or some other similar [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5043.4s)]
*  kind of thing and have someone do it where they're making sure your sleep is good and [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5051.12s)]
*  making sure that your nutrient levels are good and just slowly, start slowly. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5056.0s)]
*  That's a lot of monitoring. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5061.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that's how they have to do it. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5062.16s)]
*  That's to do it right because you want to make sure that you're- [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5063.92s)]
*  All I heard was strap and monitoring. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5064.92s)]
*  I was like, all right. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5065.92s)]
*  Yeah, but the whoop is an easy one. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5066.92s)]
*  You wear it on your wrist. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5068.599999999999s)]
*  It's nothing. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5069.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, is that like a Fitbit or what is that? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5070.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like that. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5071.599999999999s)]
*  It gets your heart rate. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5072.72s)]
*  It finds out when you're sleeping. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5075.360000000001s)]
*  It gives you all this information, what your recovery is based on heart rate variability. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5076.360000000001s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5080.76s)]
*  It's a really good device and it's simple, easy to use. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5081.76s)]
*  The app's easy to use. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5083.88s)]
*  The good thing about it is you don't have to guess. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5085.6s)]
*  If you wake up and you go, I feel like shit, and then you look at your recovery like you [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5088.4800000000005s)]
*  shouldn't feel like shit, maybe just being a lazy bitch. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5091.84s)]
*  And you go, let me just start working out a little bit and see how I feel. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5093.88s)]
*  And most of the times when I do that, as long as I'm not really feeling- like you've [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5097.3s)]
*  got to know your body. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5101.78s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like, I might be fighting something off. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5103.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel weak. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5104.9400000000005s)]
*  Like maybe I'm just going to go light and just break a little sweat and then go home. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5105.9400000000005s)]
*  But other times, they break that sweat and you're like, whoa, let's go. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5109.360000000001s)]
*  And then you start feeling it and you're like, I just needed to get woken up. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5112.46s)]
*  So it gives you data, which I think is important. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5115.820000000001s)]
*  So you make informed decisions. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5117.860000000001s)]
*  So if you wake up and you- like a lot of my friends found out they had COVID because they [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5119.24s)]
*  woke up and they just didn't feel right. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5123.62s)]
*  And they looked at their whoop strap and it said like, hey, your recovery was like 10%. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5125.1s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is going on? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5128.740000000001s)]
*  Like, why is my heart rate so high? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5130.820000000001s)]
*  You know, and then they get tested and they go, oh, you got COVID. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5132.22s)]
*  So good. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5134.46s)]
*  Now you can calm down and recover from it without letting your body get seriously taxed [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5135.46s)]
*  out and getting really sick. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5141.04s)]
*  So now, slow down now, and now let's treat it now. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5142.96s)]
*  You know, so a lot of people that I know that did that, they've avoided flus and, you know, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5146.46s)]
*  avoided them getting really bad because you catch them early. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5150.660000000001s)]
*  It gives you a heads up. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5153.1s)]
*  Catch them early, get a vitamin IV drip. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5154.58s)]
*  You ever do those? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5156.06s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5157.06s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5158.06s)]
*  That's a game changer. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5159.06s)]
*  That's a game changer. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5160.06s)]
*  Vitamin IV with zinc. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5161.06s)]
*  That's a game changer. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5162.06s)]
*  The whole cocktail. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5163.06s)]
*  Oh, the whole cocktail. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5164.06s)]
*  That immunity cocktail. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5165.06s)]
*  I'm totally all for it. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5166.06s)]
*  Oh, so good for you. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5167.06s)]
*  So good for you. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5168.06s)]
*  High dose vitamin C. Just give it to me, baby. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5169.06s)]
*  You walk out of there, you feel like whoa. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5172.06s)]
*  I found though that I was doing a lot more of those for recovery versus being like- [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5176.1s)]
*  From getting hammered? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5180.42s)]
*  Not necessarily just from being hammered, but you know, because I do drink, but you [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5181.74s)]
*  know, just being out there on the road for so much. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5186.42s)]
*  It's like go, go, go, go, go. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5188.3s)]
*  Yeah, let's add a show. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5190.3s)]
*  Sure, let's do it. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5191.3s)]
*  And then it's like drained. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5192.3s)]
*  And I found that I was getting that done regularly more so to recover versus let me just do it [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5193.3s)]
*  to be more proactive. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5198.38s)]
*  I learned it from Dave. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5199.38s)]
*  When first time I was going on the road with Dave, he goes, you want to get an IV? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5201.18s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5204.62s)]
*  You go into his room. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5205.62s)]
*  He's got a fucking penthouse room, right? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5206.62s)]
*  So we go into his room and there's like trees set up where they have these ivy trees and [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5208.74s)]
*  this whole crew is sitting there getting ivy bags. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5212.9s)]

*  This is so next level. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5218.86s)]
*  They drink tequila till like three o'clock in the morning, do mushrooms. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5219.86s)]
*  The next day they get ivied. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5224.179999999999s)]
*  And it's the first time I did it, I was like, oh, because like we had gone hard. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5225.82s)]
*  We did the Tacoma Dome in Seattle, wherever the hell is, Tacoma, Washington. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5231.08s)]

*  So it was just crazy afterwards. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5240.5s)]
*  And we went out and we saw Once Upon a Time in Hollywood privately in a movie. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5241.5s)]

*  For sure. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5307.26s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5308.26s)]
*  It's a part of the thing. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5309.26s)]
*  But it's just cool to know people like that, you know? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5310.26s)]
*  That's one of the nice things about L.A. too is that they were always coming through. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5312.26s)]
*  And they were always coming through. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5315.26s)]
*  And I think that's one of the things that's cool about L.A. is that they're always coming [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5316.26s)]
*  through. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5319.26s)]

*  So it's like, you know, when someone's in town doing a theater, I'll go check them out. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5322.46s)]
*  I'll go to the arena. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5325.46s)]

*  It's beautiful. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5337.46s)]
*  We were there for the Kill Tony 10-year anniversary show on Saturday night. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5338.46s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5341.46s)]

*  And then they have comedians, a lot of them amateur, maybe first time ever on stage. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5366.46s)]
*  They're going to do one minute. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5371.06s)]
*  And then the comedians. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5372.9s)]

*  But but also loving. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5380.339999999999s)]

*  A lot of people. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5384.98s)]

*  And then they did the 10 year anniversary and it was fucking wild. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5400.16s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5404.46s)]
*  Like just the ovation they got when they started the show. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5405.9s)]
*  I was like holy shit. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5408.18s)]
*  It's that big now. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5409.78s)]
*  Yeah because I was there in the belly room when the belly room was like half filled and [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5410.78s)]
*  they were just kind of fucking around up there. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5414.34s)]
*  And I was like this is amazing. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5415.9800000000005s)]
*  I love things like that. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5418.38s)]

*  I just it just just charges me up man. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5425.26s)]
*  I just love seeing people pull it together. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5427.82s)]

*  That's how I felt with you when I saw you in Dodger Stadium. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5436.06s)]
*  I was like look at him go. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5438.26s)]

*  Let me let me tell you something though. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5441.9800000000005s)]
*  Being able to do all those things it's awesome but the sacrifice of losing touch with certain [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5444.46s)]
*  things like I feel terrible that that I'm like just not getting introduced to something [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5450.42s)]
*  like you know Kill Tony because it's like you know at a certain point you you are so [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5456.22s)]
*  focused on working you stop seeing other things that are out there. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5461.22s)]
*  Yeah you lose touch with a lot because you're just focused on making this machine go go [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5465.18s)]
*  go and I feel I feel like man what you know how much have I been missing out on because [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5469.82s)]
*  I'm working and working and working. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5474.98s)]
*  Yeah you know I get it but I don't think you should be hard on yourself like that. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5477.7s)]
*  I don't think you're missing out on jack shit. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5481.86s)]
*  I think you're experiencing the most amazing life a person can experience. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5483.66s)]
*  You're a fucking major success touring stand up comedian who's beloved by all. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5487.78s)]
*  Come on man. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5492.46s)]

*  What the fuck are you missing out on. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5494.46s)]
*  It is incredible. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5496.58s)]
*  But I do feel though that I I I rob myself of opportunities to learn and grow in different [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5497.58s)]
*  areas because I'm doing this so much. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5504.5s)]
*  Well that's a beautiful mindset. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5507.62s)]
*  That's a growth mindset you have. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5509.139999999999s)]
*  That's why you think like that because you never really totally satisfied with yourself. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5510.58s)]
*  But that's also why you're so good. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5513.54s)]

*  They really do. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5522.18s)]
*  I don't think I've ever heard anybody say a bad thing about you ever. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5523.18s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5526.38s)]
*  All the years that I've known you not one. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5527.38s)]

*  He's the nicest guy. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5531.06s)]
*  You know you could get to the success that you've reached and not have a pile of people [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5532.06s)]
*  that are hating on you. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5538.22s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5539.3s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5540.3s)]
*  Especially in this business. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5541.3s)]
*  Especially in this business. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5542.3s)]
*  This business could be like the most community oriented comforting fucking beautiful brother [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5544.46s)]
*  and sisterhood or it could just be back stabbing nightmare depending on the circles you travel [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5549.74s)]
*  in and you know the stage of your career. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5554.74s)]
*  Also what you give off. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5558.02s)]
*  You know it's all what you give off. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5559.02s)]
*  And that was another thing too is that I always kept a circle very small and I always kept [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5561.22s)]
*  myself busy and away from the potential of having these conflicts. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5566.18s)]
*  Yeah you got to do that. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5571.02s)]
*  That's important. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5572.62s)]
*  That's important. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5573.78s)]
*  Keeping your circle small is important. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5574.78s)]
*  Small but strong. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5576.78s)]
*  And it inspires everybody else too. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5579.14s)]
*  I'm sure the guys you bring with you on the road they get inspired. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5581.14s)]
*  They're getting better. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5584.34s)]
*  Everybody gets fired up when they see that kind of experience. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5585.34s)]
*  It's like wow I didn't even know this was possible. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5587.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5590.86s)]
*  And that night at Dodger Stadium I was on stage with my buddy MartÃ­n and Alfred and [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5591.86s)]
*  it's like we've been on tour for so many years and so that was a very like it was our moment. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5597.22s)]
*  It wasn't my moment it was it was our moment. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5604.06s)]
*  It felt really really good because we were all in that grind and you know from these [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5605.78s)]
*  like little messed up cities to all of a sudden being in Europe and all over the place and [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5610.02s)]
*  now we're back home. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5614.74s)]
*  And it's like you know it's not a two o'clock show at the Ice House. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5616.34s)]
*  Are you doing Spanish shows? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5619.78s)]
*  You know what I've attempted to do it and yes I do speak Spanish but it's very different. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5622.38s)]
*  I still think in English and so to try to do my set in Spanish I feel like it loses [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5627.1s)]
*  a lot. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5632.3s)]
*  I opened up for a comic named Franco Escamilla. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5634.26s)]
*  Amazing comedian. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5636.46s)]
*  Great storyteller. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5637.46s)]
*  Super super funny. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5638.46s)]
*  And I got a chance to open for him in Mexico City at an arena for his Netflix special and [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5640.18s)]
*  I told him look I'll do 15 minutes to open in front of you on the condition that you [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5646.58s)]
*  do 15 minutes in English at Staples Center when it was still Staples Center. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5651.860000000001s)]
*  So that was our agreement. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5656.26s)]
*  He's going to perform in English and I'm going to perform in Spanish. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5657.5s)]
*  Oh that's amazing. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5660.14s)]
*  We both agreed we need to stick to our language. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5661.3s)]
*  Tom Segura's been doing Spanish shows. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5663.42s)]
*  Tom is like a sleeper man. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5667.5s)]
*  You don't realize that Tom can do that. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5669.42s)]
*  The first time I heard Tom Segura speak Spanish I'm like who are you? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5671.06s)]
*  Fluent. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5674.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah like there's no like hola amigo. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5675.780000000001s)]
*  There's none of that shit. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5678.860000000001s)]
*  He's very like hola. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5679.860000000001s)]
*  He sounds like a soap opera star. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5680.9400000000005s)]
*  And when he speaks Spanish you're like ooh look at you. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5681.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh he can speak the shit out of some Spanish. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5684.46s)]
*  What's crazy is when people talk shit around him and they don't know he can speak Spanish. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5686.900000000001s)]
*  Because he looks like a regular white guy. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5691.14s)]
*  And then it'll turn and just start just fluent. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5692.9400000000005s)]
*  Ripping into him. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5694.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5695.660000000001s)]
*  And he could do jokes in Spanish. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5696.660000000001s)]
*  Like he's fluent enough that he can manipulate his bits and turn them into bits that work [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5698.26s)]
*  in Spanish. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5703.02s)]
*  Yeah he's super fluent. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5704.02s)]
*  Like you know I can order food. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5705.02s)]
*  I can order food like a champ but to carry out a regular conversation that requires me [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5707.14s)]
*  to pull certain words. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5710.860000000001s)]
*  I'm always one of those that I'll get to a certain point and I'm like como se dice este [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5712.780000000001s)]
*  like you know I'll have to say the word in English and then go back into it. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5716.900000000001s)]
*  So I mean you know. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5720.58s)]
*  I'll look at them. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5721.58s)]
*  And what I wanted to say is that 20 years ago I had a friend there that was Spanish. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5722.58s)]
*  I mean from Madrid. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5730.78s)]
*  And the only reason I think that... [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5732.78s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5737.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5738.78s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5739.78s)]
*  I wish I could do that. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5740.78s)]
*  Like he's just making noise to me. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5741.78s)]
*  Funny right? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5742.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5743.78s)]
*  I wish I could do that. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5744.78s)]
*  I think there's a real value in learning a second language. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5745.78s)]
*  It's one of those things where I was like god damn it I don't have the time. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5749.5s)]
*  But I wish I did. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5752.34s)]
*  But pardon me says you do stupid. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5753.42s)]
*  You do a lot of other stuff. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5755.06s)]
*  Why don't you like dedicate a few hours a week to learn Spanish. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5756.06s)]
*  You know I mean it's if nothing else just communicate with people. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5759.5s)]
*  Not necessarily if you want to do stand up in Spanish. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5763.02s)]
*  That's again I thought about it. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5765.22s)]
*  I thought it'd be a great challenge but oh god no. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5766.7s)]
*  No no I'm already doing it the way that it works for me. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5770.5s)]
*  I get it. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5773.78s)]
*  Yeah fuck it. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5774.78s)]
*  You know why? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5775.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5776.78s)]
*  Why make your life harder? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5777.78s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5779.0599999999995s)]
*  I can still go perform in Mexico in English. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5780.0599999999995s)]
*  Bro when Joey Diaz used to mix Spanish and English in Miami when Joey who's Cuban from [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5781.86s)]
*  Miami when he would hit those motherfuckers with like some Cuban slang. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5789.34s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5793.58s)]
*  Oh my god you could not follow that. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5796.42s)]
*  Nobody could follow that. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5798.179999999999s)]
*  It was chaos. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5799.179999999999s)]
*  It was chaos. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5800.179999999999s)]
*  When I watched Joey crush at the Miami Improv I was like this might be the hardest a person [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5801.179999999999s)]
*  because he's funny already and then he hits them with some Spanish punch lines and people [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5807.26s)]
*  are dying. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5811.74s)]
*  Because you're hyper relating to the people at that moment. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5812.74s)]
*  I remember the first time when I performed in El Paso at the comic strip you know there [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5816.3s)]
*  was very few comics that could do Spanglish and when you got a crowd that's got 80 to [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5822.34s)]
*  90 percent Mexican and you're hitting them with stuff that's hysterical in English and [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5828.9800000000005s)]
*  now you're throwing in like I'm one of you too. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5834.46s)]
*  It was like it was such a connection and the response was like oh wow. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5837.74s)]
*  I remember I had opened up for a comic named Dan Bradley years ago. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5846.18s)]
*  Dan Bradley and a feature named Jay Vermetti and I'm the emcee and so I went out there [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5852.18s)]
*  and I'm hosting the show and I'd hit them with all the English Spanish and then hitting [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5858.58s)]
*  local references because I would spend so much time in the city. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5863.3s)]
*  Like DoÃ±a Flor and La Sqina in the corner and then like oh my god he knows DoÃ±a Flor. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5866.9800000000005s)]
*  There's outside so when you start hitting them with stuff like that the feature goes [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5871.42s)]
*  hey man you're going out there with too much energy you need to set the tone for the show. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5875.54s)]
*  You got to build it up. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5880.54s)]
*  You got to prepare it. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5881.54s)]
*  Get it so that the feature can take it from there and then you got to set up the headliner [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5883.26s)]
*  to succeed. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5886.860000000001s)]
*  And I'm like oh I'm sorry because I didn't know I was just excited and I told the manager [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5888.26s)]
*  that and the manager goes you go out there and you put your smack down and if that feature [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5891.98s)]
*  can't follow you we'll switch you. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5896.82s)]
*  Yeah shut your mouth. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5898.74s)]
*  And so the coolest thing was I wanted to do less time and then do more time in between [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5899.74s)]
*  the two. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5905.7s)]
*  The feature and the headliner as an emcee and so when I asked the headliner if that [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5906.7s)]
*  was okay he goes I'll tell you what buddy. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5910.66s)]
*  How about you do just a little bit of time up in front and when I get off stage you can [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5914.219999999999s)]
*  go on after me and you do as much time as you want. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5920.18s)]
*  I didn't know comedy etiquette yet. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5923.900000000001s)]
*  I didn't know how it was supposed to go. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5925.46s)]
*  I didn't know that that's not you're not supposed to do that. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5926.700000000001s)]
*  I was so new and green and so I did the small time up front and then the feature during [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5929.860000000001s)]
*  the show he was like that's how you do it kid. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5936.620000000001s)]
*  And then after the headliner was done I went up on stage and I did another like 15-20 minutes [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5939.860000000001s)]
*  and got a standing ovation. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5945.900000000001s)]
*  And then when I got off I'm like yeah and then the headliner, the feature, the man, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5947.74s)]
*  everybody was waiting to rip me a new one because it's like yeah we get it that you [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5952.7s)]
*  can do that but you're not supposed to do that. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5956.5s)]
*  But he told you to do it. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5958.5s)]
*  But that's what I said. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5959.86s)]
*  I go he told me to do it. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5960.86s)]
*  He goes kid I was fucking with you. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5961.86s)]
*  I didn't think you'd really do it. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5963.3s)]
*  And I'm like well you know that's how new I was. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5964.3s)]
*  He wasn't fucking with you. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5967.26s)]
*  He was scared of you going on in the middle. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5968.26s)]
*  I was super green. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5969.9s)]
*  That's what it was. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5970.9s)]
*  He didn't want you going on and crushing right in front of him. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5971.9s)]
*  That's hilarious someone telling you to not be as funny. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5974.38s)]
*  Don't be so funny. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5976.62s)]
*  You have too much energy. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5978.5s)]
*  You're too enjoyable. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5979.78s)]
*  You're too entertaining. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5980.78s)]
*  How crazy is that right? [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5982.22s)]
*  But I just remember that when I went up there and I was throwing in Spanish references and [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5983.22s)]
*  I would actually make references to television shows that were in Spanish or things that [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5987.42s)]
*  people could relate to from their childhood and doing that there it was like it was just [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5992.38s)]
*  boom. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5998.099999999999s)]
*  Like so when you're saying the thing with Joey I get it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=5999.099999999999s)]
*  Because when you can do that and you're in an area where they know you and you like yes [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6001.46s)]
*  he's one of us. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6005.9s)]
*  It's just it's a it's it's an incredible feeling. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6007.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah that's the beauty of being able to speak two languages man. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6010.379999999999s)]

*  He wasn't running enough to protect himself because he destroyed his feet like his feet [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6075.14s)]
*  were destroyed and by the end of it he was in fucking incredible shape. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6079.780000000001s)]
*  But he was running a marathon every goddamn day. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6084.54s)]
*  I think he only took like one or two days off the entire time. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6086.62s)]
*  So he ran 27 marathons in 27 days. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6090.34s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6092.9400000000005s)]

*  There's a thing that I think the finish line must be so ecstatic. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6190.38s)]
*  It must be so amazing that you actually force yourself to do that that you get addicted [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6194.94s)]
*  to that feeling that the endorphins. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6200.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6202.62s)]

*  We've had this guy in a couple of times Zach Bitter and Zach he had the world record for [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6214.58s)]
*  the fastest 100 miles around a track. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6219.82s)]
*  Was something insane. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6223.58s)]
*  What was like 10 hours. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6224.58s)]
*  100 miles ran in 10 miles in 10 hours. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6225.58s)]
*  It might have been less than 10 hours because I think it was like he averaged like a seven [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6229.58s)]
*  minute mile. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6232.7s)]
*  So how many hours did it take Zach to do that. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6235.22s)]
*  But 12 hours. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6238.74s)]
*  12 hours. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6241.74s)]
*  OK. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6242.74s)]
*  So what was his average speed then? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6243.74s)]
*  That wouldn't be seven miles an hour. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6244.74s)]
*  What would that be? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6245.74s)]
*  He did 100 miles in 11 40 55 and kept running so he could finish for 12 hours to see how [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6246.74s)]
*  much further he'd go. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6255.62s)]
*  He ran for 40 more minutes. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6256.62s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6257.62s)]
*  And got to 104.8 miles in 12 hours. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6258.62s)]
*  Someone beat it though in 2022. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6263.62s)]
*  Some other psychopath went faster. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6265.62s)]
*  A Lithuanian. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6267.62s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6268.62s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6279.62s)]
*  To beat your psychotic record of running 100 miles in under 12 hours. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6280.62s)]

*  Having to check in the hotels. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6357.94s)]
*  Everything that goes into the day with exceptions to the actual performing itself. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6360.58s)]
*  Or having to perform through when the check drops. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6364.88s)]
*  That's the only time I was like okay let's see how this goes. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6368.98s)]
*  So weathering that. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6372.179999999999s)]
*  But other than that there's no work. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6373.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't do check drops until after the show. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6375.78s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6380.18s)]
*  Yeah you have to do it that way. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6381.18s)]
*  We were doing it the other way at first. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6382.18s)]
*  I was like this is terrible. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6383.18s)]
*  Because I was watching people when other people were on stage. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6384.18s)]
*  I was like this is not good. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6386.18s)]
*  And then you hear the conversation. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6387.18s)]
*  And somebody wants to argue about the bill. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6388.18s)]
*  It's also they're talking loud because they're drunk and they don't realize they're talking [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6390.78s)]
*  loud. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6393.3s)]
*  So they're like what's 20 percent? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6394.3s)]
*  You know. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6395.3s)]
*  Do you have any cash? [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6396.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6400.74s)]
*  So it's way easier this way. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6401.74s)]
*  It's just way better for the comics. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6402.94s)]
*  It's just you know the overall experience. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6404.26s)]
*  It's all just about. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6406.54s)]
*  Let's try to make it. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6407.54s)]
*  I know there's no food but that's why. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6408.54s)]
*  To try to make it the best. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6410.34s)]
*  But I'll tell you Rapallo's next door. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6413.74s)]

*  Okay. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6430.98s)]
*  One like one piece at a time. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6431.98s)]
*  So it's like 14 pieces of sushi. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6433.78s)]
*  And they do it over the course of like an hour and a half. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6435.9s)]
*  You have sake pairings. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6438.1s)]

*  Yeah I love it. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6455.14s)]
*  He made me this one thing. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6456.52s)]
*  I probably shouldn't tell it because he doesn't want to serve it all the time. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6457.9400000000005s)]
*  This is very expensive. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6460.34s)]
*  It was uni. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6462.06s)]
*  That's it. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6464.200000000001s)]

*  Scallops and uni. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6466.200000000001s)]
*  So it's raw scallops and raw sea urchin with some rice in that nori paper. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6467.3s)]
*  And it's fucking sensational. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6472.639999999999s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6475.639999999999s)]
*  It's like the best piece of food you could literally eat. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6477.5199999999995s)]
*  It's insanity. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6481.46s)]
*  And you know it's like you don't realize how good people like someone can be at something [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6482.5599999999995s)]

*  fish. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6497.36s)]
*  Oh just rice and you roll it up like fish. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6498.36s)]
*  How hard can that be? [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6499.36s)]
*  No no no it's the little delicate flavors they put on it and the way they prepare it. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6500.36s)]
*  They dry age some of the meat and they do all these different things. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6505.48s)]
*  It's like ah ah. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6508.96s)]
*  I took Daniel Cormier. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6511.5599999999995s)]
*  It was his first time he's ever had sushi. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6512.5599999999995s)]

*  He's never had sushi. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6515.599999999999s)]
*  And you should have seen him when he was eating scallops like raw scallops. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6516.599999999999s)]
*  You can see the look on his face. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6519.76s)]
*  Was he vibing it or wasn't? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6522.8s)]
*  He was just kind of freaking out. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6524.4400000000005s)]
*  He liked some of it. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6525.4400000000005s)]
*  He did not like the raw scallops. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6526.4400000000005s)]
*  It's the texture. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6527.4400000000005s)]
*  It's the texture thing. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6528.4400000000005s)]
*  It's always the texture thing. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6529.4400000000005s)]
*  Like I can there's certain like seafood that I'm down with but then like I can't do oysters. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6530.4400000000005s)]
*  You can't do raw oysters? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6535.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6536.4400000000005s)]
*  I love them. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6537.4400000000005s)]

*  Don't even like whatever. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6541.320000000001s)]
*  If I had to. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6542.320000000001s)]
*  But there's some people like chewing it. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6543.320000000001s)]
*  I heard about someone died recently. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6545.8s)]
*  They think they got a tainted oyster and died. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6547.92s)]
*  Google that. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6550.12s)]
*  I think it was a girl. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6551.12s)]
*  I think she ate. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6553.679999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6554.679999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6556.679999999999s)]
*  I think she ate some oyster that was tainted with something. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6557.679999999999s)]
*  No? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6561.679999999999s)]
*  Fentyl. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6562.679999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6563.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah they picked up. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6564.679999999999s)]
*  This might be part of the problem. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6565.679999999999s)]
*  It was in Missouri at a seafood stand. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6568.679999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6572.679999999999s)]
*  A seafood stand like outside? [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6573.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6576.679999999999s)]
*  That's a risky person. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6577.679999999999s)]
*  That's a motherfucker that eats gas station sushi. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6578.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6581.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6583.12s)]
*  I don't know how they look to dispose of any from the business. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6584.12s)]
*  Yeah I think it's because they. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6587.12s)]
*  They just had them laying out there? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6588.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6591.12s)]
*  Fruit and seafood stand. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6592.12s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6593.12s)]
*  If you just leave oysters out there eventually they'll kill you. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6594.12s)]
*  But this says there's no evidence the business did anything to contaminate them so they're [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6596.12s)]
*  trying to determine where they came from. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6599.12s)]
*  Oh so it might have been contaminated straight from the ocean. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6601.12s)]
*  It's sort of saying they were probably contaminated when they arrived at the stand. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6604.12s)]
*  I do know that sometimes they get contaminated from the ocean. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6606.12s)]
*  My wife got sick once. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6609.12s)]

*  They say that oysters and scallops and clams are good for vegans because if you think about [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6625.5599999999995s)]
*  it, if you just really, like they're not really an animal but they give you animal protein. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6633.5599999999995s)]
*  Like scallops are, they're more primitive than plants. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6639.0s)]
*  Like they're really primitive things. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6644.0s)]
*  They don't have any like, they're not feeling jack shit. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6646.0s)]
*  Like you're... [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6650.0s)]
*  No conscience there. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6651.0s)]
*  They're kind of like a plant. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6652.0s)]
*  But they're a plant that moves. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6653.0s)]
*  But they're not a plant. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6655.0s)]
*  They're a mollusk. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6656.0s)]
*  But they don't have a brain. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6657.0s)]
*  And there's like whatever that is, is just like some sort of meat with a shell. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6658.0s)]
*  So it's a green light. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6663.0s)]
*  It's a green light I think. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6664.0s)]
*  I mean as much as eggs are. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6666.0s)]
*  Eggs are a green light too. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6668.44s)]
*  Because they just lay them. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6669.44s)]
*  If there's no rooster, there's no way that's going to be a chick. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6670.44s)]
*  You're not hurting anybody. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6673.44s)]
*  Eat the eggs. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6674.44s)]
*  And you have a good relationship with the chickens. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6675.44s)]
*  Chickens eat the grass and food. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6677.44s)]
*  What is this? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6679.44s)]
*  I think that's what it is. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6680.44s)]
*  It says it's a scout swimming. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6681.44s)]
*  That's how a scout flies around? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6682.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6684.44s)]
*  Whoa, is that real? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6685.44s)]
*  They swim? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6686.44s)]
*  It seems like that's not what's happening but... [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6687.44s)]
*  It is what's happening. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6689.44s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6690.44s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6691.44s)]
*  But it is what's happening. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6692.44s)]
*  It swims like a... [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6693.44s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6694.44s)]
*  I didn't know they could do that. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6695.44s)]
*  It's so weird looking. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6696.44s)]
*  Mmm. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6697.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6698.879999999999s)]
*  Plant, huh? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6699.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6700.879999999999s)]
*  Well, whatever the fuck it is. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6701.879999999999s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6702.879999999999s)]
*  I mean it's a bivalve is what it is. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6703.879999999999s)]
*  It just moves. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6704.879999999999s)]
*  There's something in there. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6705.879999999999s)]
*  It's obviously not a plant. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6706.879999999999s)]
*  It's a mollusk. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6707.879999999999s)]
*  But it moves. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6708.879999999999s)]
*  I mean that's the thing that it does. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6709.879999999999s)]
*  It moves. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6711.879999999999s)]
*  There's a video I've seen of puffer fish I think eating them. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6712.879999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6716.48s)]
*  Oh wow, that's wild. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6717.48s)]
*  It just chew on it. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6718.48s)]
*  It makes a loud crunch. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6719.48s)]
*  Yeah, because the shell's hard. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6720.48s)]
*  Freaking puffer fish. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6721.48s)]
*  But whatever they are though is not really an animal. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6722.48s)]
*  That's why I've heard a neuroscientist make this argument. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6726.5199999999995s)]
*  It's really probably the most ethical thing that you can eat. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6730.5199999999995s)]
*  As long as there's sustainable numbers of them. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6733.5199999999995s)]
*  Because they don't even know you're eating them. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6735.5199999999995s)]
*  There's nothing going on there. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6738.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just a piece of meat covered by a shell. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6740.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6742.5199999999995s)]
*  How many vegans do you know? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6743.5199999999995s)]
*  I know quite a few. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6744.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6745.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6746.5199999999995s)]
*  How about you? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6747.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6748.5199999999995s)]
*  He he he he. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6749.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6753.5199999999995s)]
*  I know of them. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6754.5199999999995s)]
*  I respect people's choices. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6755.56s)]
*  And I think that one is a complicated one. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6758.56s)]
*  And it's a convenient one too. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6761.56s)]
*  The convenient one is not taking into account all the animal deaths involved in large scale [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6763.56s)]
*  agriculture. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6768.56s)]
*  Which is where you get most of your vegetables. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6769.56s)]
*  Because there's a lot of animal death involved in that. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6771.56s)]
*  A lot. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6773.56s)]
*  There's also poisoning. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6774.56s)]
*  There's a lot of poisoning of the land with pesticides and herbicides. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6775.56s)]
*  There's a lot of shit that goes on to these monocrop agriculture. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6778.56s)]
*  Establishments. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6783.6s)]
*  Which is where you get a lot of your vegetables from. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6784.6s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6786.6s)]
*  And it's not good for the environment. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6787.6s)]
*  It's not good for the animals. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6788.6s)]
*  It's definitely not good for any animal that lives in that field. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6789.6s)]
*  They're getting fucked up. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6791.6s)]
*  The only animals get churned up in combines. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6793.6s)]
*  And yes. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6795.6s)]
*  How many birds and gophers and groundhogs they kill. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6796.6s)]
*  It's just it's in order. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6799.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6801.6s)]
*  To maintain the crops. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6802.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6803.6s)]
*  It's I mean Ted Nugent has broken it down and he actually knows the statistics and like [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6804.6s)]
*  what is actually involved in it. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6808.6s)]
*  But when I talk to people that run the farm. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6809.6s)]
*  When they describe industrial farms and all the shit that they have to do and how all [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6811.64s)]
*  that gets into the rivers and it poisons the rivers. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6814.64s)]
*  It's wild stuff man. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6817.64s)]
*  And that's that's vegetables. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6818.64s)]
*  That's how they're growing things on topsoil. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6820.64s)]
*  It's dead. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6823.64s)]
*  So they have to constantly pour all these fertilizers and nitrogen and all this shit [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6824.64s)]
*  all over the all over the ground because there's no nutrients left in the topsoil. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6829.64s)]
*  They have to do all this. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6833.64s)]
*  It's real complicated man. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6835.64s)]
*  And the water that runs into the rivers it's so this guy Will Harris from White Oak Pastures [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6837.68s)]
*  and he has a regenerative farm and he's right next to a farm that's an industrial farm. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6843.68s)]
*  And there's like a clear line between the runoff on his side where the water is clear [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6847.68s)]
*  and then the runoff on his neighbor's side where is immediately you can see that it becomes [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6852.68s)]
*  mud. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6856.68s)]
*  See the line. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6857.68s)]
*  Look at the line. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6858.68s)]
*  That's the line. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6859.68s)]
*  That's the property. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6860.68s)]
*  That's the property. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6861.68s)]
*  That's the property. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6862.68s)]
*  That's the property. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6863.68s)]
*  Look at the line. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6864.72s)]
*  That's the line. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6865.72s)]
*  That's the property line on the right hand side. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6866.72s)]
*  It's just horrible. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6869.72s)]
*  On the left hand side it looks like a river and that's the dividing line between their [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6870.72s)]
*  two farms which is fucking insane. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6875.72s)]
*  It's insane that that's legal and that that's normal. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6878.72s)]
*  That runoff. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6881.72s)]
*  It's like unintended pollution. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6882.72s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6884.72s)]
*  It's on the topsoil and the topsoil is all dead. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6885.72s)]
*  So all the stuff that they pour on it just runs off when it rains into the into the river. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6887.72s)]
*  God, look at that. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6892.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6893.76s)]
*  So there's that. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6894.76s)]
*  And then there's this new evidence that plants can think and plants communicate and plants [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6897.76s)]
*  share information and that through mycelium through the actual like the fungus that's in [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6902.76s)]
*  the soil they're exchanging information and even the resources. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6908.76s)]
*  That there's intelligence in it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6911.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6912.76s)]
*  There's something there. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6913.76s)]
*  They're screaming when you eat them, K. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6914.76s)]
*  Oh God, no. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6916.76s)]
*  There was lettuce out of the ground, screams. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6917.76s)]
*  I want to say it was like a modern version of the Twilight Zone. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6921.8s)]
*  There was an episode where this guy was trying to lose weight and he was going to eat vegetables [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6925.8s)]
*  out of his fridge and every vegetable would make a sound like that. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6931.8s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6935.8s)]
*  So he's trying to eat but he can't eat anything and he's starving and at the end everything [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6936.8s)]
*  just kind of rotted and they found the guy dead. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6941.8s)]
*  It was creepy but yeah. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6944.8s)]
*  Did you ever see the one, there's an old Twilight Zone where these aliens come down and they [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6947.84s)]
*  introduce themselves to Earth and they give us a book and the book is to serve man. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6954.84s)]
*  They find this book that they have and then they realize it's a cookbook. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6959.84s)]
*  Oh. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6963.84s)]
*  At the end of the movie. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6964.84s)]
*  That's like the punchline. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6966.84s)]
*  The aliens have come down here to eat us. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6967.84s)]
*  So what? [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6970.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6971.84s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6972.84s)]
*  See this guy's in front of all that. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6973.88s)]
*  Give me some of the volume. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=6976.88s)]
*  You simply trust us. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7003.84s)]
*  It seems like what's happening now. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7033.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7042.88s)]
*  Exactly what's happening now. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7043.88s)]
*  So at the end of it they translate the book and they realize what it actually says. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7045.88s)]
*  We're going to make sushi out of Ted. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7051.88s)]
*  This could be cut off. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7053.88s)]
*  It's only a six minute video. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7055.88s)]
*  Might not be in the whole episode. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7057.88s)]
*  How long is it? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7059.88s)]
*  Six minutes. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7060.88s)]
*  No, that's definitely not the whole. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7061.92s)]
*  I think it's before that and he realizes it. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7084.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7086.92s)]
*  Yeah, that would suck. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7087.92s)]
*  It would suck. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7089.96s)]
*  It would suck. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7091.96s)]
*  Especially like we can sort of justify killing dumb things. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7093.96s)]
*  You know? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7097.96s)]
*  You know, but. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7098.96s)]
*  Dogs are pretty smart. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7099.96s)]
*  There's people out there that are eating dogs. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7101.96s)]
*  Dogs are pretty goddamn smart to be eating them. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7103.96s)]
*  There's a lot of animals that have, you know, I feel they're very smart. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7106.96s)]
*  Pigs. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7110.96s)]
*  Pigs are freaking smart. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7111.96s)]
*  You can train a pig to do almost anything that you can train a dog to do. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7112.96s)]
*  Just think about what people do to dolphins. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7115.96s)]
*  Just think of that. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7118.0s)]
*  They're fucked up. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7120.0s)]
*  I mean, they're really smart. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7121.0s)]
*  Now imagine some alien that's just like, what if humans are delicious? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7123.0s)]
*  What if like in all the cosmos, they're like the favorite food? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7127.0s)]
*  Yeah, or like a buffet. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7131.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7133.0s)]
*  And maybe you get intelligence from them. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7134.0s)]
*  Maybe when you eat people, you get a little bit of their DNA. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7136.0s)]
*  We're like their, what is it called? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7139.0s)]
*  Their limitless pill. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7141.0s)]
*  Like, oh, man, every time you eat one of them, oh, it's like euphoric. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7142.0s)]
*  Maybe we're like their mushroom. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7145.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7147.04s)]
*  We get them high. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7148.04s)]
*  Yeah, they have a trip. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7149.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7150.04s)]
*  Wasn't that like dolphins use puffer fish to get high? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7151.04s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7153.04s)]
*  So they're sucking in toxins. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7154.04s)]
*  How do they do? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7156.04s)]
*  How would they figure that out? [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7157.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7160.04s)]
*  So Joe, how long before do you think they confirmed that we got, you know, that the aliens are real? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7162.04s)]
*  Every week, man, I keep watching these stories and I'm like, oh, I was just in Las Vegas last week too. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7169.04s)]
*  I was looking for those eight feet aliens that the guy was talking about. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7173.04s)]
*  That one's, that one's sus. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7176.08s)]
*  We were talking about that earlier. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7179.08s)]
*  It's like, ah, come on. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7180.08s)]
*  Come on. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7181.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7182.08s)]
*  That George Knapp guy, who's the probably the lead investigative reporter when it comes to the UFO phenomenon. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7183.08s)]
*  He's the guy that discovered Bob Lazar and that, you know, he's he went to try to talk to those people and they were kind of avoiding them. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7188.08s)]
*  They didn't knock. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7197.08s)]
*  They didn't answer the door. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7198.08s)]
*  But it could be that they just don't want the attention. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7199.08s)]
*  Like maybe they freaked out. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7202.08s)]
*  Maybe they freaked out. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7203.12s)]
*  Maybe they had no idea it was going to go viral like that. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7204.12s)]
*  Maybe it really happened. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7206.12s)]
*  Look, imagine if it really happened. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7208.12s)]
*  Imagine you're just chilling in your backyard and you hear boom. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7210.12s)]
*  And you're like, what? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7213.12s)]
*  And you go outside and you see a fucking UFO and a 10 foot alien and you stand there and you're staring at them and then they get back on the craft and take off. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7215.12s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck just happened? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7223.12s)]
*  And then no one's going to believe you. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7226.12s)]
*  So you tell people, but you feel so stupid. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7228.12s)]
*  They're like, yeah, they were in my backyard. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7230.12s)]
*  They're like 10 feet tall and they had big eyes. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7232.16s)]
*  And it was like, look at this. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7234.16s)]
*  Come on, man. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7235.16s)]
*  The fuck out of here. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7236.16s)]
*  But maybe it really did happen. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7237.16s)]
*  And maybe you realize, like, what am I going to do? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7238.16s)]
*  Have people just keep telling me I'm a liar or just shut the fuck up? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7240.16s)]
*  Maybe I just shut the fuck up. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7243.16s)]
*  Maybe I would shut the fuck up. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7245.16s)]
*  Maybe if it happened in my yard, maybe if they landed in my yard, I would just I would just know for sure they're real. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7247.16s)]
*  But keep it to myself. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7254.16s)]
*  I don't want people thinking I'm out of my fucking mind. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7255.16s)]
*  If something like that happened, you know, you look for, you know, can you prove this? [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7257.2s)]
*  Can you can you tell this story without looking like a total lunatic? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7262.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7265.2s)]
*  This thing landed. All right. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7266.2s)]
*  So there's a ring. OK, there's the burn marks from the jets or whatever. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7267.2s)]
*  There's footprints. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7270.2s)]
*  There's certain there's certain elements. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7271.2s)]
*  But everybody's so quick on the draw. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7272.2s)]
*  Like if something happens, you know, fight breaks out. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7274.2s)]
*  World started in two seconds. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7276.2s)]
*  People are gunslingers with their cameras. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7277.2s)]
*  Right. Why wouldn't you be a gunslinger when there's a fucking UFO in front of you? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7279.2s)]
*  That'd be the first. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7282.2s)]
*  I know instantly. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7283.2s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7285.2s)]
*  That'd be the first thing you go out in the backyard and you're not going to. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7286.24s)]
*  There's no reason why there shouldn't be more more footage, more clean footage, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7290.24s)]
*  because it's always grainy. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7294.24s)]
*  It's always messed up. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7295.24s)]
*  It's a shadow. It's a bush. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7296.24s)]
*  It's, you know, so I'm like, here's my problem with it. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7297.24s)]
*  My problem is that I want it to be real. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7300.24s)]
*  And I know a lot of people want it to be real. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7303.24s)]
*  And I also know it's an amazing distraction. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7305.24s)]
*  It's an amazing distraction for a bunch of ways. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7308.24s)]
*  Like, let's imagine that what we're actually looking at is some United States military vehicle [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7310.28s)]
*  that they have developed secretly that operates on some different kind of propulsion system, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7318.28s)]
*  some sort of gravity drive or something. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7324.28s)]
*  And maybe it's a drone and they can shoot these things across the sky at the same rates of speed. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7326.28s)]
*  But they don't want to admit they have the technology. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7330.28s)]
*  What better way than to say that we're being visited? [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7332.28s)]
*  What better way? [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7335.28s)]
*  Like, if you really were going to high technology, [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7336.28s)]
*  if you had bases under the sea where you had hypersonic drones just shot through the sky, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7338.32s)]
*  you couldn't even follow them with your eye. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7344.32s)]
*  If you had those, why would, what better way to hide it than to say, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7346.32s)]
*  smoking mirrors over here. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7352.32s)]
*  Yeah. And then have a few whistleblowers come out and have these guys, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7353.32s)]
*  well, I can tell you definitively that we have recovered 12 crashed UFOs. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7356.32s)]
*  I know it sounds crazy. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7361.32s)]
*  Like that kind of stuff makes me wonder. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7362.32s)]
*  Like, that's how I would do it. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7365.32s)]
*  If I wanted to dupe people into thinking that these things that maybe they occasionally see that we operate, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7366.36s)]
*  that they're not ours, because we don't have that kind of capability. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7372.36s)]
*  If I was going to lie about our capability, which maybe you should, [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7375.36s)]
*  and maybe they've done before with like the stealth bomber, remember? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7379.36s)]
*  They fucking developed that bitch. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7382.36s)]
*  People thought they were seeing UFOs and saw that thing fly around. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7383.36s)]
*  You ever seen one of those in real life? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7386.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7387.36s)]
*  Woo! [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7388.36s)]
*  Pretty cool. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7389.36s)]
*  Pretty fucking cool. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7390.36s)]
*  I would say that they're UFOs. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7391.36s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7393.36s)]
*  Like, they don't tell the truth about anything, right? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7394.4s)]
*  They never tell you about top secret stuff that you really don't have. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7397.4s)]
*  What are you going to do with the information that UFOs are real? [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7402.4s)]
*  What is the general public going to do with it? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7405.4s)]
*  Jack shit. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7407.4s)]
*  They're not going to do anything. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7408.4s)]
*  So if they had it, why would they tell us? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7409.4s)]
*  If they really had irrefutable evidence that this something is an off-world vehicle, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7411.4s)]
*  it comes from another dimension, it comes from another planet, why would they tell us? [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7417.4s)]
*  If they really had irrefutable evidence that this something is an off-world vehicle, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7420.44s)]
*  it comes from another dimension, it comes from another planet, why would they tell us? [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7423.44s)]
*  They only tell us if they have to tell us, or they would tell us the stuff that they [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7424.44s)]
*  have is actually from another planet because they don't want people to know what they can [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7427.44s)]
*  do yet. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7430.44s)]
*  That's what I would do. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7431.44s)]
*  I mean, if I had a history of deception, I would be deceiving people about that. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7432.44s)]
*  Or it could be really aliens, and that's the problem. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7437.44s)]
*  And I don't, I know me, and I want it to be aliens real bad. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7441.44s)]
*  Real bad. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7448.48s)]
*  So I will not be objective when I look at that subject. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7451.48s)]
*  I am always going to be hopeful. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7454.48s)]
*  I'm always going to be having fun with it. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7456.48s)]
*  I'm always going to be thinking that it's probably real. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7459.48s)]
*  I believe the pilots. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7462.48s)]
*  I think the math says it all. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7463.48s)]
*  I mean, the universe is so massive. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7466.48s)]
*  I mean, it's so massive. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7469.48s)]
*  How can we be the only ones? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7470.48s)]
*  We may not be. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7472.48s)]
*  We might be visited. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7474.48s)]
*  And it might be a combination of both of those things. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7475.5199999999995s)]
*  It might be some of those things are our drones, and it might be some of the things are not [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7478.5199999999995s)]
*  ours, and maybe some of the things are from other countries as well. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7482.5199999999995s)]
*  And maybe some of those things are from another planet, or maybe from some life form that [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7485.5199999999995s)]
*  we haven't established that has bases in the ocean. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7490.5199999999995s)]
*  Because there's a lot of these, at least one of them they got on video that is a craft [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7493.5199999999995s)]
*  that was flying in the air and then went into the ocean. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7499.5199999999995s)]
*  It didn't even make a splash. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7501.5199999999995s)]
*  It didn't even make a splash. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7503.56s)]
*  It just went right in the ocean. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7504.56s)]
*  Like a diver. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7506.56s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7507.56s)]
*  Is that bullshit? [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7508.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7509.56s)]
*  It's kind of blurry. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7510.56s)]
*  Like, I wish it was clean, but it was miles away, and they're using infrared footage at [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7511.56s)]
*  night or whatever their night vision at night. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7515.56s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7518.56s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7519.56s)]
*  The problem is I want it to be aliens. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7520.56s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7521.56s)]
*  So I'm like, bro, there's so much evidence now. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7522.56s)]
*  And even talk to people like Michio Kaku, who's this physicist, this brilliant guy, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7525.56s)]
*  and he's saying that there's more evidence that they exist than that. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7529.6s)]
*  Now it's up to the people that don't think they exist to try to prove it wrong because [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7533.6s)]
*  there's so much visual evidence, tracking evidence, tracking data. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7537.6s)]
*  But I'm always like, what have they been working on some stuff? [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7542.6s)]
*  What have they been just scooping up top scientists and fucking they've got some sort of plan [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7546.6s)]
*  for some different propulsion system and it's operable and they've been working on it for [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7550.6s)]
*  decades in secret? [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7555.6s)]
*  What if what if that's the case? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7556.6s)]
*  That seems like it could be. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7558.64s)]
*  But if the technology is that advanced, then where did you get it? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7560.64s)]
*  Well, like, I get you're smart enough to come up with certain things, but, you know, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7564.64s)]
*  people did research on gravity drives and there's there's papers that were written on [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7568.64s)]
*  the possibility of manipulating gravity. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7573.64s)]
*  I just don't think there was ever a power source that was figured out. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7576.64s)]
*  I don't think like you'd have to generate some fucking insane amount of power to be able [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7580.64s)]
*  to manipulate gravity. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7584.68s)]
*  But I think they theorized it a long time ago. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7586.68s)]
*  So if you just threw all the best scientists and all the money that you could possibly [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7589.68s)]
*  fucking steal from the taxpayers and you funneled it off into this program that's making a [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7594.68s)]
*  UFO, maybe they could do it. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7600.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7602.68s)]
*  I mean, I'm not in that world, you know? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7603.68s)]
*  You know, that's like if someone said to you, imagine there's a guy out there. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7605.68s)]
*  Nobody's ever heard of him. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7610.68s)]
*  He's never done stand up before, but he's been practicing and he writes comedy every [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7612.72s)]
*  day and he practices in front of the mirror. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7616.72s)]
*  And one day he's going to go on stage. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7619.72s)]
*  He's going to be the best comic that's ever lived. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7620.72s)]
*  You'd be like, no, it's not possible. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7623.72s)]
*  He's not going to be able to just go on stage the first time and be the best comic that's [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7625.72s)]
*  ever lived. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7628.72s)]
*  It's literally not possible. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7629.72s)]
*  So maybe the things that I'm saying about physics and these physicists developing this [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7631.72s)]
*  gravity drive without anybody knowing, maybe that's not possible because maybe that's not [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7635.72s)]
*  my world, you know? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7638.72s)]
*  Well, you're looking at it through the eyes of a comic who understands timing and you [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7640.76s)]
*  have to, you know, trial and error. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7645.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7648.76s)]
*  And they would look at physics that way. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7649.76s)]
*  They would understand what they're, you know, they would say, no, no, you can't just, you [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7651.76s)]
*  can't violate the laws of physics with a select group of people that stay quiet and don't [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7654.76s)]
*  tell people about it and come up with some insane new method of propulsion. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7659.76s)]
*  You know, these things, they've tracked them. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7664.76s)]
*  They go from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50 feet in like a second. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7666.8s)]
*  They have no idea how it's doing it. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7670.8s)]
*  No heat signature. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7673.8s)]
*  The things are blocking their tracking devices, like whatever radar systems they're using, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7675.8s)]
*  which is like technically supposedly an act of war. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7681.8s)]
*  Like it's wild shit, man. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7685.8s)]
*  And they don't know what it is. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7687.8s)]
*  And they think it was interacting with some base in the water. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7688.8s)]
*  And the guy who saw it was on the podcast, Commander David Fravor. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7690.8s)]
*  And it's a crazy story because he was with another fighter jet. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7694.84s)]
*  They all saw it. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7698.84s)]
*  Multiple people saw it. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7699.84s)]
*  They filmed it. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7700.84s)]
*  They have all the tracking data that shows this insane rate of speed that it went at. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7701.84s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck that is. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7705.84s)]
*  And also the, when you say the laws of physics, maybe the laws of physics don't apply to wherever [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7709.84s)]
*  that technology came from. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7714.84s)]
*  It's very different. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7716.84s)]
*  Or also maybe we just don't understand all the laws of physics. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7717.84s)]
*  Maybe it's malleable. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7721.84s)]
*  And that's like this idea of a gravity drive. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7722.88s)]
*  Like that maybe you can, instead of traveling through space, you can literally fold space to you. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7724.88s)]
*  And then and then instantaneously appear. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7730.88s)]
*  Like a portal. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7734.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7735.88s)]
*  Like some sort of, like they've described it in the movie Event Horizon, that you would essentially [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7736.88s)]
*  like a piece of paper, you would fold the two pieces of time together and punch a hole [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7740.88s)]
*  through both of them and wind up on the other side when it flattens out. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7745.88s)]
*  Okay. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7748.88s)]
*  That was deep. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7749.88s)]
*  Okay. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7750.88s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7751.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7752.92s)]
*  All right, what's on the top of the word? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7753.92s)]
*  But I think that, yeah, now you're ready to meet the devil. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7754.92s)]
*  I think maybe if aliens are real, I think we'd be interesting. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7757.92s)]
*  You know, I certainly think they'd come here. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7761.92s)]
*  And maybe they've always been coming here. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7763.92s)]
*  I really don't know. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7765.92s)]
*  I don't know, but I want it. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7766.92s)]
*  I want it to be real. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7767.92s)]
*  And that's my problem. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7768.92s)]
*  My problem is I'm a true believer. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7769.92s)]
*  So I want it to be real. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7771.92s)]
*  So I always have to go, I don't know. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7773.92s)]
*  But I try to do that with everything. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7775.92s)]
*  I try to do that with everything. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7776.92s)]
*  I'm like, man, I don't know. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7778.92s)]
*  Something smells funny. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7779.92s)]
*  I don't want to be that guy who's calling bullshit when it's not bullshit. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7780.96s)]
*  So I have to be careful. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7783.96s)]
*  I've got to really look at it and just let it operate for a while. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7784.96s)]
*  Watch it behave. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7788.96s)]
*  And so the more I watch this UFO thing operate, the more I get skeptical. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7791.96s)]
*  I'm like, it just seems too, like, a Psi-op. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7796.96s)]
*  It seems too, too much of it just seems like fucking fabricated. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7801.96s)]
*  You know? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7808.96s)]
*  Like even the stories about finding them in an archaeological dig and are you sure? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7810.0s)]
*  Are you sure that's what happened? [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7817.0s)]
*  You know, is this the narrative they're telling you? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7819.0s)]
*  Why would they tell the truth? [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7821.0s)]
*  Why would they tell the truth? [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7822.0s)]
*  If they had some fucking crazy object they've been working on and maybe the scientists that [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7823.0s)]
*  really knew how to work it was dead. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7827.0s)]
*  And so now you've got new guys you're bringing in to try to like back engineer his work. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7829.0s)]
*  But maybe that's what they do. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7835.0s)]
*  Like who fucking knows, man? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7836.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7838.0s)]
*  But I know the UFO stories, the most fun, the alien stories, the most fun. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7839.04s)]
*  That's the one I'm most interested in. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7844.04s)]
*  Yeah, every night, man. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7847.04s)]
*  It's like, okay. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7848.04s)]
*  Have you seen Moment of Contact? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7849.04s)]
*  No. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7851.04s)]
*  Oh, you need to watch that. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7852.04s)]
*  Moment of Contact. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7853.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7854.04s)]
*  It's a documentary about a UFO crash in Brazil, in Virginia, Brazil in 1996. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7855.04s)]
*  And the whole town saw it. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7859.04s)]
*  All these witnesses in the town saw the things, saw the things in the sky. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7861.04s)]
*  And one of them, it was a lightning storm, like a terrible lightning storm. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7866.08s)]
*  And one of them crashed. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7869.08s)]
*  And these people found whatever the thing was and two bodies. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7871.08s)]
*  And one of them was alive. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7876.08s)]
*  And they picked the one that was injured and they took it in a car to several different [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7878.08s)]
*  hospitals. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7883.08s)]
*  This is all documented that they took this body. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7884.08s)]
*  And the guy who was carrying the body died of a serious bacterial infection that they [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7886.08s)]
*  could not cure. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7891.08s)]
*  They didn't know what the fuck it was. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7892.08s)]
*  Young, healthy guy. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7893.08s)]
*  The guy handling the alien body. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7894.12s)]
*  He died within like two weeks. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7896.12s)]
*  They didn't know what the fuck. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7898.12s)]
*  There's all this documentation on the disease, the progression of the disease, how they [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7899.12s)]
*  couldn't stop it. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7904.12s)]
*  They didn't know what it was. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7905.12s)]
*  Some crazy bacterial infection that he got. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7906.12s)]
*  And they think he got it from that alien. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7909.12s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7911.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7912.12s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7913.12s)]
*  But goddamn, I want it to be true. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7914.12s)]
*  Now, this is a documentary? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7915.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great documentary. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7917.12s)]
*  It's on Netflix or it's on Apple. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7918.12s)]
*  I think it's on everything. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7920.12s)]
*  Is it on everything? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7921.12s)]
*  Moment of contact. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7922.16s)]
*  It's definitely, I think it's on Apple TV. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7923.16s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7925.16s)]
*  What kind of footage did they have? [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7926.16s)]
*  Well, they don't have any footage. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7927.16s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7929.16s)]
*  They have eyewitness accounts. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7930.16s)]
*  They have, they have, they know that the U.S. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7932.16s)]
*  Air Force landed one of their large cargo jets in Brazil, in Virginia, and supposedly [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7936.16s)]
*  left with the wreckage. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7943.16s)]
*  But they know that they came in. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7944.16s)]
*  They were called in. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7946.16s)]
*  It's definitely on Netflix. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7947.16s)]
*  It's definitely on Amazon to rent or buy. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7948.2s)]
*  So it's on iTunes also. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7951.2s)]
*  It's a few places. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7952.2s)]
*  I think I found where you could find it for free. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7953.2s)]
*  But what's crazy is they bring this cop back to the spot where the crash was, where they [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7955.2s)]
*  first saw the crash. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7960.2s)]
*  And the guy hadn't been there in forever. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7961.2s)]
*  And the dude just starts crying. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7963.2s)]
*  He just starts weeping. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7965.2s)]
*  And I'm like, if this guy, if this guy is an actor, he needs a fucking Academy Award. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7966.2s)]
*  Get him, get him on, get him on more. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7973.2s)]
*  Like this moment where he's overwhelmed, where he's talking about the experience of seeing [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7974.24s)]
*  this thing there and knowing that it's from somewhere else and seeing these things, these [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7977.24s)]
*  little tiny things with big eyes staring at him. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7981.24s)]
*  And these girls, there's three girls that were like very young at the time. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7984.24s)]
*  They were sisters and they were playing outside and they saw this thing. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7988.24s)]
*  And they said the thing was like trying to communicate with him, telling him, tell him [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7991.24s)]
*  to help it. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7994.24s)]
*  And they were freaked out. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7995.24s)]
*  And they all had the exact same story. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7996.24s)]
*  Everybody saw them, said, I'm going to go to the hospital. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=7998.24s)]
*  I'm going to go to the hospital. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8000.24s)]
*  I'm going to go to the hospital. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8001.24s)]
*  They all had the exact same story. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8002.28s)]
*  Everybody saw them, said the exact same thing, what they looked like, like these weird things [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8003.28s)]
*  with tiny things with big eyes. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8007.28s)]
*  I don't know if it's true, man, but I want it to be true. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8009.28s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8011.28s)]
*  I want it all to be true. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8012.28s)]
*  That guy's passion, though, the way he tells the story, you could tell either, like you [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8013.28s)]
*  said, he's either a great actor or he's reliving it. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8017.28s)]
*  I'm God, maybe it's a mass psychosis. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8022.28s)]
*  Maybe they're all in mushrooms. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8024.28s)]
*  Maybe or maybe he's telling the truth, which would be fucking insane. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8026.28s)]
*  And if there really are things, if there really are things that can visit us and the question [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8031.32s)]
*  would always be like, would their vehicles would crash when they be past crashing now? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8037.32s)]
*  Wouldn't they be beyond that in technology? [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8042.32s)]
*  Not necessarily, because here's the thing. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8046.32s)]
*  If you think about where the technological level that human beings are at right now, [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8049.32s)]
*  like in a first world country, and then you go to the Amazon and you have the indigenous [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8054.32s)]
*  hunter gatherer tribes who still live the old way, they're there too at the same time [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8060.36s)]
*  in 2023. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8064.36s)]
*  So just because there's aliens out there doesn't mean they're all the same level of advancement. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8066.36s)]
*  There might be an alien out there that's a thousand years ahead of us, just a thousand, [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8070.36s)]
*  and every now and then they get hit by lightning, just like everybody does. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8073.36s)]
*  You can't predict it. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8076.36s)]
*  And they make their way through and they might have landed, they might have ported back to [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8077.36s)]
*  wherever the lightning storm was and didn't understand it was going to happen and got [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8082.36s)]
*  fucked up and crash landed in a backyard in Brazil. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8086.4s)]
*  It might have happened. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8090.4s)]
*  What always gets me is that the technology on spacecraft never matches the body. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8092.4s)]
*  It's always something that's like, all these different, like right now there's that video [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8098.4s)]
*  that they're showing something in the backyard that's hiding. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8104.4s)]
*  And this thing looks, it almost looks ape-like. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8108.4s)]
*  So there's nothing that, it's not wearing anything. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8111.4s)]
*  I don't know about that video. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8113.4s)]
*  What is this video? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8114.4s)]
*  But I'm saying, you know what I'm talking about, right? [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8115.44s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8117.44s)]
*  It's fake as fuck, right? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8118.44s)]
*  They were saying it was the UFO from the video. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8119.44s)]
*  They were saying it's the Vegas thing? [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8121.44s)]
*  They just took one audio and put it over top of another video. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8123.44s)]
*  You never see the body or whatever match, whatever the technology is as far as the craft. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8128.44s)]
*  Well, the most compelling story does, and that's the Bob Lazar story. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8134.44s)]
*  And Bob Lazar is a guy who is a propulsion expert. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8138.44s)]
*  He says he was hired to work in Vegas back engineering in Nevada, in the desert area S4, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8141.48s)]
*  where they were back engineering an alien craft. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8149.48s)]
*  And he said it was designed for tiny things, like something that was like three feet tall. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8152.48s)]
*  You had a crouch inside of it. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8156.48s)]
*  And he said everything was impossibly smooth. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8157.48s)]
*  Like it was like melted wax. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8160.48s)]
*  Like there was no seams. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8161.48s)]
*  There was no, the way it was constructed, whatever the metal was, was some. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8163.48s)]
*  It looked like it was one piece. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8167.48s)]
*  Yes. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8168.48s)]
*  There was some metal that they just do not, they did not understand it. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8169.5199999999995s)]
*  And they had a reactor. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8172.5199999999995s)]
*  And this reactor created some sort of an anti-gravity wave that allowed this thing to move. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8174.5199999999995s)]
*  And this reactor was based on an element that wasn't on the periodic table yet, element 115. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8179.5199999999995s)]
*  And these people, these beings, supposedly have a stable version of this element. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8184.5199999999995s)]
*  And in this reactor, it allows them to violate all of our understanding of propulsion systems [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8190.5199999999995s)]
*  and use some sort of gravity based propulsion. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8198.560000000001s)]
*  I want to believe it. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8201.560000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8202.560000000001s)]
*  Sounds awesome. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8203.560000000001s)]
*  I want to believe all of it. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8204.560000000001s)]
*  I don't even want to question it for a second. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8206.560000000001s)]
*  I don't want to believe there's any lies. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8208.560000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, that looks fake as fuck. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8210.560000000001s)]
*  I still know where it's from. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8213.560000000001s)]
*  It's got to be from somewhere. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8214.560000000001s)]
*  But what is that? [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8215.560000000001s)]
*  That looks so weird, dude. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8217.560000000001s)]
*  Like a monkey, right? [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8219.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that looks like some sort of a big foot. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8220.560000000001s)]
*  It said it's eight feet tall. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8222.560000000001s)]
*  Bigfoot from space, bro. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8223.560000000001s)]
*  Maybe that's it. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8225.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so what is it? [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8226.6s)]
*  Are they small little Martians or are they big giant, you know, avatar looking things? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8228.6s)]
*  Supposedly, there's two different kinds. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8233.6s)]
*  What they call them? [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8236.6s)]
*  The greys, the greens. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8237.6s)]
*  Yeah, they call them the greys and the tall whites. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8239.6s)]
*  And the tall whites almost look Scandinavian. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8241.6s)]
*  They have like white hair and they have their ears are like flat against their head and [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8243.6s)]
*  their eyes are like twice as large as ours. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8248.6s)]
*  But why am I saying that? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8250.6s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck I'm saying. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8252.6s)]
*  Somebody said it, so I repeated it. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8254.6s)]
*  You know, the problem is then you start looking for that. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8256.6s)]
*  So say if you're tripping on mushrooms, you might manifest like a gray talking to you [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8259.6s)]
*  because you know, like from close encounters of the third kind, you expect that's what [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8264.6s)]
*  the alien is going to look like. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8267.6s)]
*  So maybe it shows itself to you in that form because that's how you can handle it. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8269.6s)]
*  What do you call it? [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8273.6s)]
*  What's the other one? [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8275.6s)]
*  The shape shifters? [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8277.6s)]
*  And then there's the men in black, right? [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8279.6s)]
*  They come visiting and fucking erase your brain. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8281.6s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8283.6s)]
*  I was waiting. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8284.640000000001s)]
*  I was like, he's going to pull something cool up right now. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8286.640000000001s)]
*  The way you lean back, I thought you were going to bring up something. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8288.640000000001s)]
*  I was like, here it comes. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8290.640000000001s)]
*  Scratching my head. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8292.640000000001s)]
*  I think we were both like, ah. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8294.640000000001s)]
*  I hope aliens are real. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8296.640000000001s)]
*  I really do. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8298.640000000001s)]
*  And I hope that the fairy tale is that they're going to protect us from blowing ourselves up. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8300.640000000001s)]
*  That's the fairy tale. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8304.640000000001s)]
*  That would be the best case scenario. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8306.640000000001s)]
*  That what they're doing here is that they're here to monitor our nuclear weapons. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8308.640000000001s)]
*  And make sure we don't launch them at each other. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8314.640000000001s)]
*  Because that's when they first start showing up. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8316.640000000001s)]
*  All the stories about UFOs really kicked in after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8318.640000000001s)]
*  That's when it was like UFOs were hovering over the White House. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8324.640000000001s)]
*  You ever see those pictures? [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8328.640000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8330.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's like an ancient photo of UFOs over the White House. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8332.640000000001s)]
*  You can see like a few flying saucers that they photographed in the sky flying over the White House. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8334.640000000001s)]
*  Of course it's grainy. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8340.640000000001s)]
*  But it's like 1952? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8341.68s)]
*  Is it two? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8343.68s)]
*  51, 52? [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8345.68s)]
*  That story is, there is a video from not too long ago where people think that was happening again. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8347.68s)]
*  Do you have the photos from the old one though? [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8351.68s)]
*  The original one? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8353.68s)]
*  When is this one from? [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8355.68s)]
*  That's totally fake. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8357.68s)]
*  This is 2011. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8359.68s)]
*  That's from 2011. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8361.68s)]
*  On some video that I think was on C-SPAN or something. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8363.68s)]
*  Something was going on back there. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8365.68s)]
*  It could be spotlights. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8367.68s)]
*  We have to see the video. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8369.68s)]
*  Are they saying it was UFOs? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8371.68s)]
*  I just, UFO response, or White House response to UFO request. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8374.68s)]
*  I don't remember that from 2011, do you? [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8379.68s)]
*  Sorta. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8382.68s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8384.68s)]
*  I've seen a few videos where people are watching these long, you know, big b-roll footage of like skylines and people are like, look at that fly by this building. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8386.68s)]
*  And this is, this is from NBC? MSNBC? [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8394.68s)]
*  Probably not going to play, so let me find another one. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8397.68s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8399.720000000001s)]
*  That's okay. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8401.720000000001s)]
*  Here's the 52. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8403.720000000001s)]
*  How would they know to fly over that? [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8405.720000000001s)]
*  That's the place to be. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8407.720000000001s)]
*  That's fake, obviously. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8409.720000000001s)]
*  What is that in the left hand corner? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8411.720000000001s)]
*  Not that. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8413.720000000001s)]
*  I don't know that they would have had a photo of this. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8415.720000000001s)]
*  The story was in the paper for sure. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8417.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, so maybe they didn't have any photos. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8419.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, someone would have been taking a picture at night in front of the White House. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8421.720000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8425.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably right. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8427.720000000001s)]
*  This is probably everything. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8429.720000000001s)]
*  This is why it's so hard today with all these fake images and CGI. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8431.720000000001s)]
*  Man, you could do any, AI is scary. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8434.720000000001s)]
*  I remember I'm in Reddit here. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8436.720000000001s)]
*  This is deep Reddit stuff, so this isn't the best place to take... [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8438.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8441.720000000001s)]
*  So that's the photo, supposedly. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8443.720000000001s)]
*  1952. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8445.720000000001s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8447.720000000001s)]
*  But that does, that looks like reflection and that could be a lot of things. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8449.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it could be a lot of things. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8452.720000000001s)]
*  It could be birds, but it looks big. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8454.720000000001s)]
*  All right. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8456.720000000001s)]
*  They look kind of big. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8457.76s)]
*  They look like cars in the sky, bigger than cars. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8459.76s)]
*  Don't they? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8461.76s)]
*  I mean, they're behind the tower, right? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8463.76s)]
*  Don't know where the person was taking the photo. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8465.76s)]
*  Yeah, also, how do I know that's real? [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8467.76s)]
*  Or is that verified? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8469.76s)]
*  Yeah, it could be dust in the print when they were making it even. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8471.76s)]
*  People fuck with pictures so much, man. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8474.76s)]
*  Look, there's a little scratch up in the corner up there. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8477.76s)]
*  What is that? [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8479.76s)]
*  Above your cursor. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8481.76s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8483.76s)]
*  That's another UFO. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8485.76s)]
*  I spilled coffee on the negative. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8486.800000000001s)]
*  I want it to be real. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8488.800000000001s)]
*  That's the real problem, don't you? [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8490.800000000001s)]
*  You know what? [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8492.800000000001s)]
*  I believe it. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8494.800000000001s)]
*  I don't know that I want it to be real because part of me is like, I think that they would look at us like we're an ant farm. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8496.800000000001s)]
*  Well, maybe. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8500.800000000001s)]
*  Or like whenever you see primates and they're teaching them sign language or they teach them how to do certain things and it's like, okay, maybe they're teaching us how to do certain things just to see what we do. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8502.800000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8516.800000000001s)]
*  The level of intelligence, we have a certain understanding and we can only unlock so much, but who knows what level, whatever else out there is at. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8518.800000000001s)]
*  And maybe it's like, hey, let's teach them how to make, be able to talk to each other. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8528.800000000001s)]
*  Let's teach them how to do this, maybe to study. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8533.800000000001s)]
*  You never know. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8536.800000000001s)]
*  Could be. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8538.800000000001s)]
*  I don't think that we're figuring that out on our own, but that they, if I was an alien life form, I would watch us and I would say, let's just make sure they don't fuck anything up. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8539.84s)]
*  Like they seem to be on a path. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8549.84s)]
*  The path is technological progression. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8551.84s)]
*  Everything keeps getting better and faster and computers and electric cars and airplanes are faster and everything's far better and computers is far more power. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8553.84s)]
*  At a certain point in time, I bet every civilization goes through that. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8562.84s)]
*  If they get to be, if aliens are real, if they really get to be super sophisticated where they can travel through the cosmos, I bet they all get to that point where they're learning how to be civilized at the same time they're learning insane technology. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8567.880000000001s)]
*  And then the people that get access to the insane technology are still barbaric and they still want to use it to fucking nuke countries and shit. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8582.880000000001s)]
*  There's probably a balancing act there that gets achieved by every civilization and it's probably pretty precarious. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8589.880000000001s)]
*  Like right now, like in the state where we're at now, it might probably like getting close to the recent precarious. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8595.92s)]
*  Like this could be like the Ukraine thing. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8602.92s)]
*  Like they're actually shooting giant metal pipes at each other. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8604.92s)]
*  Boom, boom. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8608.92s)]
*  Like this is actually happening. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8610.92s)]
*  So if I was an alien life form and I realized that this is a nuclear superpower that's engaging in this, I gotta be like, hold the fuck on. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8612.92s)]
*  Let me break the kids up. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8619.92s)]
*  Relax. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8621.92s)]
*  But also, if I was in government, I wanted to lie to people about some shit that I had, I'd start putting all these UFO stories out there. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8622.960000000001s)]
*  That way you could scare the shit out of them. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8630.960000000001s)]
*  If they found out there was an alien invasion, the only way to stop it was to shut down the internet and give the controls of the internet to the president where they could limit it to a certain amount of time during the day. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8633.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because the aliens, can't let the aliens take over. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8644.960000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8648.960000000001s)]
*  I've always said too, like, you know, I don't think they'll, we'll go back to the, you know, stay home mask situation unless we get to a point where it'd have to be the next level. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8650.0s)]
*  It couldn't just be an illness. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8662.0s)]
*  It couldn't be a virus or disease. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8664.0s)]
*  It would have to actually be, you know, aliens are here. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8666.0s)]
*  People know the playbook now for that one. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8669.0s)]
*  They don't know the alien playbook. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8671.0s)]
*  So if an alien invasion or a fake alien invasion happens. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8673.0s)]
*  Look, we know what happens when people get freaked out. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8675.04s)]
*  That's the war of the worlds. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8679.04s)]
*  It's going to be the Orson Welles. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8681.04s)]
*  Orson Welles thing. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8683.04s)]
*  I mean, that's wild. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8685.04s)]
*  Like they announced at the beginning of that broadcast what it was, but a lot of people tuned in the middle. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8687.04s)]
*  Those motherfuckers thought the aliens were there. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8693.04s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8695.04s)]
*  Like you're just home and all of a sudden you turn that on. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8697.04s)]
*  I think people killed themselves. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8699.04s)]
*  Was there any suicide that was attached to the Orson Welles? [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8700.080000000002s)]
*  I think we've gone over this before and I think there was at least one suicide. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8704.080000000002s)]
*  That someone was so scared that the Martians were coming that they killed themselves. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8707.080000000002s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8711.080000000002s)]
*  Bro. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8713.080000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8715.080000000002s)]
*  Like that's what happens when people freak out. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8717.080000000002s)]
*  And if they freak out over a virus, imagine how they're going to freak out about aliens. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8719.080000000002s)]
*  And what if they're aliens that are harvesting human souls or something fucking demonic and wild like that. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8722.080000000002s)]
*  I'll never get my soul. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8727.12s)]
*  You never? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8729.12s)]
*  No, I'm saying like people are saying they'll never get my soul. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8731.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8733.12s)]
*  There's a PBS article that is counter to this story we've heard for a while. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8735.12s)]
*  It did a little bit of research on it and it says that not only did very few people hear the actual broadcast, virtually no one thought it was real. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8739.12s)]
*  Really? [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8747.12s)]
*  But wait a minute, why was that like a cultural narrative for so long? [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8749.12s)]
*  I could read an article that you know. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8752.12s)]
*  Maybe it's, who is saying this? [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8753.160000000002s)]
*  There's a couple different researchers who have looked up the stuff. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8755.160000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8757.160000000002s)]
*  This is what this article says. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8759.160000000002s)]
*  Memory and media have an incredibly complex relationship. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8761.160000000002s)]
*  Well, that is true. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8764.160000000002s)]
*  Could be based, maybe because some headlines were posted that just said that and that's what everyone took. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8766.160000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8772.160000000002s)]
*  Which they definitely did a lot. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8774.160000000002s)]
*  Well, that's Reef for Madness. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8776.160000000002s)]
*  They definitely did a lot of that back then. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8778.160000000002s)]
*  They lied about a lot of shit back then. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8780.160000000002s)]
*  Also, whoever, maybe the newspaper and the radio station were in cahoots. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8781.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's true, right? [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8786.2s)]
*  And even today, to this day, they use sensationalist headlines. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8788.2s)]
*  So maybe they did that, like telling people that everybody believed it and then the story spread. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8790.2s)]
*  That kind of makes sense. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8796.2s)]
*  This says from surveys done immediately after the program. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8798.2s)]
*  The problem with that is I didn't believe it at all. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8800.2s)]
*  I'm too smart for that fucking radio. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8803.2s)]
*  So there's probably a bunch of people that got duped. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8806.2s)]
*  But putting stuff out there like that back then, do you think people were more likely to believe it back then because it was so like, oh shoot. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8807.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't have the internet. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8813.240000000002s)]
*  They didn't have Twitter. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8815.240000000002s)]
*  They couldn't just go, what the fuck is this? [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8817.240000000002s)]
*  And someone's going to go, actually we checked, this is what it is. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8819.240000000002s)]
*  And now you know. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8821.240000000002s)]
*  Back then, you have no idea. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8823.240000000002s)]
*  You read the newspaper. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8825.240000000002s)]
*  The newspaper is the truth. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8827.240000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8829.240000000002s)]
*  That's why everybody was so scared of weed. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8831.240000000002s)]
*  Because William Randolph Hearst conspired with Harry Anslinger to make marijuana demonized. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8832.28s)]
*  And they put it in the newspapers. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8839.28s)]
*  Yeah, the insanity. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8841.28s)]
*  What do they say it makes you do? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8843.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8845.28s)]
*  It made you do everything. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8847.28s)]
*  It's an amazingly stupid movie. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8849.28s)]
*  This guy's smoking pot and just fucking throwing people out of windows. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8851.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8853.28s)]
*  That's closer to blow. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8855.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8857.28s)]
*  Or angel dust. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8859.28s)]
*  Something. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8860.320000000002s)]
*  Something else will make you do that. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuIkpur2xd0&t=8862.320000000002s)]
