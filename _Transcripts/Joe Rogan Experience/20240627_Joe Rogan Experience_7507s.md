*  If it was fresh, you couldn't do that twice. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=34.0s)]
*  It's fresh. If it's fresh, you get like that close. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=35.0s)]
*  And you're just like... [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm awake. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=40.0s)]
*  That was a good one though. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Definitely awake. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=42.0s)]

*  I'm gonna take a big blast, right before I go on stage. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=47.0s)]
*  Supposed to wake up your central nervous system or something. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=50.0s)]
*  I don't even know if there's any science to it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=53.0s)]
*  No, it just sucks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=55.0s)]
*  It might be just a bunch of psychos. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=56.0s)]
*  Who just like, freaking their brain out with smelling salts. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=58.0s)]
*  I'm awake. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=62.0s)]
*  Anyway man, congrats on the movie. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=63.0s)]
*  Looks awesome. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=64.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=65.0s)]
*  It's very exciting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Very nice to be here. Big fan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=67.0s)]
*  Thank you. My pleasure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=68.0s)]
*  It's... boy, Jesus Christ, is it over the top. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=69.0s)]
*  Way over the top. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=72.0s)]
*  This fucking deal is so crazy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=73.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=75.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=76.0s)]
*  I saw a thing online of the amount of people that John Wick has killed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=77.0s)]
*  compared to like, Michael Myers and Jason. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=81.0s)]
*  Jason. Oh yeah. By a long strike. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=85.0s)]
*  I think we beat Rambo too. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=87.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you beat everybody. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=88.0s)]
*  But I think we had more deaths than Keanu spoke words in the movie. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Oh for sure. 100%. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=93.0s)]
*  What everybody's bringing up to me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=95.0s)]
*  I think he spoke 308 words in the movie or something. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well listen, it works. It's perfect. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, something fun. Something for the guys. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=103.0s)]
*  And the action fans and everybody out there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=104.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. It's murder porn. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=106.0s)]
*  Hopefully it's artistic murder porn. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=110.0s)]
*  It's artistic. It is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=112.0s)]
*  It's interesting how they're all so different too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=114.0s)]
*  Like the fourth one is almost like a comic book movie. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=116.0s)]
*  It's so over the top and crazy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=119.0s)]
*  Graphic anime. I think it's probably the best story that we've told. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=122.0s)]
*  But it's definitely wrapped up in the hyper real world. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=126.0s)]
*  You know, we get bored so we want to go somewhere and do something. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=129.0s)]
*  It's always like, how do we start these things? What do we do? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=131.0s)]
*  We never start with a concept. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=134.0s)]
*  It's usually we're done, we're done, we're never going to do one again. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=136.0s)]
*  And then Japan gets released like six months after the rest of the world. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=138.0s)]
*  So we're usually doing a press tour in Japan and we're sitting in the Imperial Hotel. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=142.0s)]
*  They have an amazing scotch bar. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=145.0s)]
*  And we start off with the first drink. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=147.0s)]
*  Thank God it's done. God, we survived. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=149.0s)]
*  And by like the fifth scotch, we're like, hey man, I got a great fucking idea. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=151.0s)]
*  Let's have them fight ninjas. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=154.0s)]
*  And then that's how it starts. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=157.0s)]
*  And it's been that way for the last three. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=158.0s)]
*  So you started off as a stuntman. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=162.0s)]
*  And how did you transition to becoming a director? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=163.0s)]
*  Because that's like, there's got to be a lot of barriers that are in the way. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=166.0s)]
*  I think different time for sure. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=171.0s)]
*  You know, before cell phones, before that stuff. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=173.0s)]
*  We started as a stunt guy before all the streamers. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=176.0s)]
*  You know, I was working for this guy Ernie Ersadi way back in the day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=179.0s)]
*  Brilliant stunt corps and second year director on television. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=182.0s)]
*  And I was working on, I don't know if you remember the old show, like Pretender. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=188.0s)]
*  He could be anything. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=190.0s)]
*  And I was doing a gig on that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=191.0s)]
*  I had just done a car hit. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=193.0s)]
*  I think I was on like 24. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=194.0s)]
*  I split my head off on the linch. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=196.0s)]
*  That was a mess. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=198.0s)]
*  And then he comes to me as I'm holding the ice pack on my head. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=199.0s)]
*  He's like, hey, they're having auditions for the sci-fi film in Burbank. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=202.0s)]
*  You know, you're off. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=205.0s)]
*  If you hurry, you can make it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=206.0s)]
*  And jeans and a t-shirt. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=208.0s)]
*  I'm bleeding. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=210.0s)]
*  And I'm like, all right. Yeah, sure. I'll go make it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=211.0s)]
*  It's for that Keanu Reeves guy, you know, in Speed. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=212.0s)]
*  Keanu Reeves. I'll go see him. Sure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=214.0s)]
*  So you go up there and it was an audition for The Matrix. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=216.0s)]
*  And, you know, at the time, you remember back in the day, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=219.0s)]
*  there weren't a lot of martial art movies at a big budget level. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=222.0s)]
*  It was like Steven Seagal or Van Damme or, you know, Mark Dacascos, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=225.0s)]
*  all those guys at the time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=231.0s)]
*  And martial arts, you know, they didn't do them in big budget films. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=232.0s)]
*  It was considered low budget, you know, action porn kind of thing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=235.0s)]
*  And we get there, get to this big warehouse in Burbank, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=238.0s)]
*  and you saw this guy really scruffy looking with a neck brace, you know, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=242.0s)]
*  punching. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=245.0s)]
*  It's Keanu. He had just come out from neck surgery. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=246.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=248.0s)]
*  And there's like 15 Hong Kong and Chinese stuntmen there, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=249.0s)]
*  screaming and yelling. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=252.0s)]
*  And I said, hey, I'm here for the audition. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=253.0s)]
*  And I meet these two fellows that come over, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=255.0s)]
*  and it's the Wachowskis at the time, now Lana and Lilly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=258.0s)]
*  And they introduced themselves and were like, hey, you know, I'm Chad. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=262.0s)]
*  I'm here for the audition. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=265.0s)]
*  Okay, great. This is Yong Wu Ping. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=266.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, no one told that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=267.0s)]
*  And Yong Wu Ping we knew from, was the big choreographer that started Jet Li [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=270.0s)]
*  and Jackie Chan. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=273.0s)]
*  Did like Iron Monkey. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=274.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=276.0s)]
*  Yeah, Once Upon a Time in China and all that stuff. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=277.0s)]
*  So it was Yong Wu Ping and his guys. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=279.0s)]
*  And they're like, okay, you just you just follow this guy and this little guy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=281.0s)]
*  named Tiger Chen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=284.0s)]
*  Fucking phenomenal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=287.0s)]
*  Guy could do triple flip twist. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=288.0s)]
*  This could do anything. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=290.0s)]
*  A Wushu champion. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=291.0s)]
*  They just follow that guy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=292.0s)]
*  Just do what he does. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=293.0s)]
*  And for the next hour, I tried, you know, being the tall white guy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=294.0s)]
*  trying to just keep up with him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=297.0s)]
*  Can you do all that stuff? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=299.0s)]
*  God, no. God. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=300.0s)]
*  I just do as much as I could until I fell down. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=302.0s)]
*  But I was pretty flexible. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=304.0s)]
*  I had a good gymnastic background. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=305.0s)]
*  So I throw a backflip. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=306.0s)]
*  I do the kicks. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=307.0s)]
*  I do all the spin hook kicks. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=308.0s)]
*  And, you know, we train with a lot of Taekwondo guys and stuff. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=309.0s)]
*  So we were pretty good at all the kicking and punching and some of the acrobatics. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=311.0s)]
*  But then it got to a level. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=314.0s)]
*  He picks up a stick and now it's you know, you've seen the Wushu guys. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=318.0s)]
*  Going mental. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=319.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, boy, you know, at the end of an hour, you know, I'm in jeans [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=320.0s)]
*  and a t-shirt still bleeding from a head wound. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=323.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=325.0s)]
*  Did you have a concussion? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=326.0s)]
*  I probably I think so. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=327.0s)]
*  Knowing now, looking back like, yeah, it didn't seem too good. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=329.0s)]
*  But I finished. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=332.0s)]
*  I drove home, thought, wow, I really screwed the pooch on that one. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=334.0s)]
*  I never thought I'd hear from those guys again. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=336.0s)]
*  And then like a month later, hey, can you come back and exact same audition again? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=338.0s)]
*  Exact same. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=342.0s)]
*  And then got the call saying, hey, would you like to double Keanu Reeves on this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=343.0s)]
*  sci fi movie in Australia? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=348.0s)]
*  And I was like, ah, yeah, I got this other gig on TV. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=350.0s)]
*  I think I'm going to have to pass. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=354.0s)]
*  And the producer at the time was Barry Osborne, who went on to do all the all the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=355.0s)]
*  Lord of the Rings. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=359.0s)]
*  And he was like, yeah, he's kind of a little angry at me saying no. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=360.0s)]
*  And I thought, OK, I fucked that up. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=364.0s)]
*  I'll never work again. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=366.0s)]
*  And then cut to two months later, it was in February. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=367.0s)]
*  He calls back, hey, we had to push the shoot. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=370.0s)]
*  You available now? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=372.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, actually, I am. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=373.0s)]
*  So I literally flew to Australia like two weeks later, got there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=374.0s)]
*  And within a day, you realized, oh, this wasn't this isn't a normal show. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=378.0s)]
*  You saw the rehearsals. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=382.0s)]
*  You saw some of the sets. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=383.0s)]
*  You saw some of the footage. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=384.0s)]
*  And it was the fucking Matrix. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=385.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=386.0s)]
*  So that's how we got in. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=387.0s)]
*  How I got in with the Wachowskis. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=388.0s)]
*  And I spent the next eight and a half years with them through all the Matrix sequels [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=390.0s)]
*  and all some of their other shows. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=393.0s)]
*  And with James Wittig doing V for Vendetta, I just lived in the Wachowski world. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=394.0s)]
*  And that's probably one of the most incredible film schools you'll ever have. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=397.0s)]
*  You know, I sort of got to know Keanu and all that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Cut two years later after all that, Keanu and I had worked together for so long there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=403.0s)]
*  He knew I had been doing a lot of second unit directing, which for people that don't know, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=409.0s)]
*  it's the action, the fight scenes, the car chases, the sunsets, all the shit first unit [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=413.0s)]
*  doesn't want to deal with. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=417.0s)]
*  Usually big action sequences. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=419.0s)]
*  So they have these action directors or second unit guys go out and do the action. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=420.0s)]
*  Trying to do it more efficiently without the cast, with the stunt doubles and such. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=423.0s)]
*  And Keanu had gotten this script that he thought was something interesting about it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=428.0s)]
*  It was called Scorn. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=433.0s)]
*  And it was the original John Wick script. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=434.0s)]
*  How did it become called John Wick? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=437.0s)]
*  Derek Colestead's grandfather's name is John Wick. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=439.0s)]
*  Derek Colestead being the writer of it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=442.0s)]
*  So he just gave tribute to his grandfather, called him Wick, John Wick. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=444.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=447.0s)]
*  Pretty trippy. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=448.0s)]
*  And so how did that become the name of the movie? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=450.0s)]
*  Keanu, at the original script Scorn, the guy was like 65. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=454.0s)]
*  He lived in a little brown. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=458.0s)]
*  So it was very, very grounded script. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=459.0s)]
*  I think only two people died in the original script. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=460.0s)]
*  It was like one of the car crashes. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=462.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=463.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was just very, it was very Cold War, old school. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=464.0s)]
*  And that's where the gold coins came from because you didn't want to leave a paper trail. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=469.0s)]
*  It had very simple little ideas. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=472.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=474.0s)]
*  And he handed it to myself and was like, Hey, would you like to take a look at this? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=475.0s)]
*  And I was like, Sure, sure, sure. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=479.0s)]
*  I read it and I was like, Yeah, I don't know what to do with this action wise. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=481.0s)]
*  He only kills two people. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=483.0s)]
*  It's like, Well, we're trying to change it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=484.0s)]
*  And we're thinking of this. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=485.0s)]
*  I'm like, Well, you know, he's like, Would you like to direct it? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=486.0s)]
*  I was like, Whoa, yes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=489.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I had no experience directing and then you direct John Wick. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah, just second unit. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=495.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=496.0s)]
*  Me and my partner at the time, Dave Leach, I called Dave, that was on a Friday. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=497.0s)]
*  I called Dave on a Saturday going, Hey, we might have a shot. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=500.0s)]
*  We got to put a pitch together in 24 hours. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=503.0s)]
*  So I always had this idea about Greek mythology and how we could layer it and do this. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=505.0s)]
*  Like I'm a big Tolkien fan. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=508.0s)]
*  So how do you take a fantasy gig and make it modern day? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=510.0s)]
*  So we're like, Let's take it that way and we'll put gods and Greeks and Sharon and the River Sticks and we'll make this whole Zeus thing going on. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=514.0s)]
*  And we kind of laid it and Keanu just heard it on Monday. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=522.0s)]
*  Went, Hmm, interesting. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=525.0s)]
*  And he said, Sure, you want to do it? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=528.0s)]
*  I'm like, Yeah, you know, me and my partner, Dave, we'll co-direct. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=530.0s)]
*  We'll do this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=532.0s)]
*  And we got it to the producer of Basil Ionic the next day. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=533.0s)]
*  And he goes, Well, Keanu, why don't you? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=536.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=538.0s)]
*  We had done a little tape on that Sunday about the, you know, the gun food stuff. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=539.0s)]
*  We took Aikido, Aikijitsu, put it all the close quarter tactical shit with some reloads. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=541.0s)]
*  And we did a quick little previs in our space, 8711 back in L.A. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=546.0s)]
*  And showed it to him. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=550.0s)]
*  Everybody thought, Oh, my God, this is going to be great. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=551.0s)]
*  Can Keanu do it? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=553.0s)]
*  We're like, Yeah, I hope so. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=554.0s)]
*  Where did the magazine reload flip come from? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=556.0s)]
*  That funny thing that I'm going to give total cred to Keanu. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=559.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=563.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=564.0s)]
*  He started doing that in the second one. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=565.0s)]
*  I'm like, Dude, what are you doing? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=566.0s)]
*  He's like, Yeah, I'm checking it out. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=568.0s)]
*  He started doing it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=569.0s)]
*  I was like, That's awesome. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=570.0s)]
*  It is awesome. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=571.0s)]
*  People do that now. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=572.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=573.0s)]
*  It's a legit thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=574.0s)]
*  They're doing a competition. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=575.0s)]
*  You know how crazy that is? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=576.0s)]
*  That an actor for a film decides to come up with a thing and it's actually a quicker way to eject a magazine. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=577.0s)]
*  He didn't do it. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=585.0s)]
*  He knew forehand and backhand. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=586.0s)]
*  He does it with the AR. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=587.0s)]
*  He does it with the AR too. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=588.0s)]
*  Like you're watching the second one, do a quick flip with the AR and he'll put it on. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=589.0s)]
*  You're like, Where the fuck did he get that? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=592.0s)]
*  Well, he really, really trained for that movie. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=594.0s)]
*  That's him. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=597.0s)]
*  You can really tell. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=598.0s)]
*  I mean, there's films where guys do tactical scenes where you go like, OK, you know, I can buy it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=599.0s)]
*  But in that movie. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=606.0s)]
*  The typical military way of cutting through, you know, pying the corners and stuff, the very tactical sense. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=607.0s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=612.0s)]
*  I see that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=614.0s)]
*  It's like with martial arts. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=615.0s)]
*  You can do the quick finger jab in the eye. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=616.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=618.0s)]
*  Once in a while, that staccato beat is cool. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=619.0s)]
*  But choreography and for the visual of it, I think sometimes you have to add something. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=621.0s)]
*  You have to show people something they kind of expect, subvert it and give them something a little bit different. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=624.0s)]
*  Spice it up a little bit. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=631.0s)]
*  So I think we went more with the competition sense. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=632.0s)]
*  You know, I saw Taron online. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=634.0s)]
*  You know, JJ Perry, a buddy of mine, introduced me to Taron online and I saw Taron and I saw some of the quick. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=636.0s)]
*  I was like, Fuck, that's what we got to put a little spice in this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=641.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=643.0s)]
*  And then sent Kiano out there and he was. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=644.0s)]
*  Taron is such a freak. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=646.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=647.0s)]
*  Freak of me. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=648.0s)]
*  Like he should. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=649.0s)]
*  No one. Let's be honest. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=650.0s)]
*  No one should be that good. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=651.0s)]
*  He's crazy. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=652.0s)]
*  It's crazy how good he is. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=653.0s)]
*  He should not be that good. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=654.0s)]
*  The speed that he has is so insane. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=655.0s)]
*  How many people have you seen that are good at what they do? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=656.0s)]
*  He's such a good guy too. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=658.0s)]
*  He's such a fun guy to be around. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=659.0s)]
*  So easy going. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=661.0s)]
*  And what a great instructor too because he's so calm and easy. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=662.0s)]
*  And he's got a naturalistic approach. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=665.0s)]
*  It's just follow your body. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=668.0s)]
*  He's one of the only reasons I like to go back to LA. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=669.0s)]
*  For real. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=672.0s)]
*  He's the only reason I go to Simi Valley. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=673.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=675.0s)]
*  Well, that's I mean, whenever I'm in town, I always make a trip. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=676.0s)]
*  And you get better every time, right? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=679.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=681.0s)]
*  There's a little something. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=682.0s)]
*  Just by watching him, you can see. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=683.0s)]
*  And I was up there just yesterday, as a matter of fact, picking up something. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=684.0s)]
*  And I had introduced him to an actor about like three, four weeks ago. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=689.0s)]
*  And he had taken this cast member in just three sessions. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=693.0s)]
*  And the cast member happened to be up there yesterday. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=697.0s)]
*  And to watch what he had done with him in three weeks, I mean, granted, there is a little natural ability there, I could tell. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=700.0s)]
*  But like the progression and how fast he gets you from just pointing a firearm to drawing it, hip shooting, pressing, walking and running through the course. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=707.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=717.0s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to explain, right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=718.0s)]
*  Until you actually you can see it online. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=719.0s)]
*  But when you're there and seeing how fast the pings are coming and actually watching Taron go through the obstacle course. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=726.0s)]
*  It's really, really impressive. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=727.0s)]
*  Now, he's a freak. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=729.0s)]
*  He's weird. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=730.0s)]
*  But like something's going on in his brain. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=731.0s)]
*  Do you think like there's something about the hand-eye coordination? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=733.0s)]
*  We all have a little bit, especially through martial arts. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=736.0s)]
*  But that's not like that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=738.0s)]
*  Well, obviously, he's been doing it forever. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=740.0s)]
*  But there's some he's got some God given ability. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=742.0s)]
*  It's got to be some autism, right? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=745.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=746.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=747.0s)]
*  He can just he I've seen him do things where he's looking one way and he's still lining up like he just knows that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=748.0s)]
*  What would you call it? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=753.0s)]
*  Like that physical dismal, that body memory. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=754.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=757.0s)]
*  And the motor muscle memory to get in there and play. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=758.0s)]
*  And no red dot. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=760.0s)]
*  He's doing it all through the all our insights. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=761.0s)]
*  Old school. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=763.0s)]
*  All old school. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=764.0s)]
*  And that's how he teaches, which I love. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=765.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love it, too, because he says red dots fail. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=766.0s)]
*  And I've had red dots fail all the time. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=768.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the time. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=770.0s)]
*  And you're like, what the fuck is it? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=771.0s)]
*  Fucking shit. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=772.0s)]
*  And you're fucking with it. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=773.0s)]
*  And he's just like, OK, as you're fucking around with it, exactly. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=774.0s)]
*  I'm just going to shoot. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=778.0s)]
*  But he's been he's been very good. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=779.0s)]
*  Like I'm naturally left handed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=780.0s)]
*  But I always shoot with him right handed. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=782.0s)]
*  But he's helped me so I can he's got me to the point where I can kind of go through the range with both hands and the same dominant eye, which is a bit of a trip. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=784.0s)]
*  Next thing you go, try try alternate hands. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=790.0s)]
*  It'll mess with your but I think it'll help your sighting. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=792.0s)]
*  I'm sure everything you do with your left hand will help your right hand. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=795.0s)]
*  I learned that from martial arts. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=798.0s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=800.0s)]
*  Someone told me that a long time ago that if you practice your bad side, it actually improves the technique on your good side. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=801.0s)]
*  I think it helps you think in a different way. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=806.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=808.0s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons why left handed people are so good at things. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=809.0s)]
*  What they say like, you know, back in the day, you know, gladiatorial, whatever, like the left handed because it was hard. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=811.0s)]
*  It wasn't so much that they were better. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=816.0s)]
*  They just you weren't used to to fighting with them. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=817.0s)]
*  Well, I think also well, there's definitely that like when you spar with people, especially in boxing. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah, when they go southpaws. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=825.0s)]
*  When you spar southpaws, it's so confusing. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=826.0s)]
*  Well, it fucks up your footwork because you want to keep stepping on their foot. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=828.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=831.0s)]
*  Kickboxing, maybe it's a little bit different. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=832.0s)]
*  Well, kickboxing. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=833.0s)]
*  Well, MMA in particular, like the elite guys like Sanhagen, these guys, they switch stances constantly. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=834.0s)]
*  Constantly. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=841.0s)]
*  And so this is you're getting overloaded with possibilities all the time, which makes it so interesting when you get to these high level guys. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=842.0s)]
*  You know, we get to like an Israel Adesanya guy. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=850.0s)]
*  They give you so many looks. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=852.0s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck is going on. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=855.0s)]
*  They're changing that stance all the time. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=856.0s)]
*  And fainting all the time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=858.0s)]
*  It's very interesting. I came up. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=860.0s)]
*  I did a lot of box from say like Savat, which is very open stance. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=861.0s)]
*  Like they'd move. It's constant motion. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=865.0s)]
*  If you watch those old Savat guys, right, they're constantly. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=866.0s)]
*  So they would fall from a false lead. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=868.0s)]
*  And you see so much of that now. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=870.0s)]
*  And I mean, you're right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=872.0s)]
*  It's false leads. They're switched. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=873.0s)]
*  So you don't. It's hard to gauge or set them up. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=874.0s)]
*  Yes. It's fascinating to watch. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=876.0s)]
*  I think athletes today, especially in martial arts, are like just right. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=877.0s)]
*  Whole nother level. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=881.0s)]
*  Whole nother level. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=882.0s)]
*  You can't even compete with what. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=883.0s)]
*  They're the best of the best. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=884.0s)]
*  No one's ever been better. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=885.0s)]
*  It's like martial arts. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=887.0s)]
*  I've always said this, that since 1993 in the last 30 years, martial arts have [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=888.0s)]
*  evolved more than they have over the last 30,000 years. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=893.0s)]
*  Completely agree. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=896.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=897.0s)]
*  No ifs ands or buts. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=898.0s)]
*  The fitness, the training mentality and just the combative alacrity that these guys have. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=899.0s)]
*  The ability to. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=905.0s)]
*  I mean, they're insane athletes, number one. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=906.0s)]
*  But to kick, punch, shoot and grapple and not miss a beat and get right back up. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=908.0s)]
*  You just watch them. It's almost choreography. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=913.0s)]
*  That's how good they're being trained. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=915.0s)]
*  I mean, they're zero range. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=917.0s)]
*  You know, before it used to be like jab, jab, jab, so you can shoot it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=918.0s)]
*  Now it's like they can change ranges on the fly. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=921.0s)]
*  They're so good at it. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=924.0s)]
*  And they're switching levels on you. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=925.0s)]
*  Like they're doing one thing to set up a takedown. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=927.0s)]
*  They're using takedowns to set up strikes. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=931.0s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=933.0s)]
*  It's mental. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=934.0s)]
*  It's so mental. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=935.0s)]
*  It's scary how good it is. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=936.0s)]
*  It really is because it's so much different than any other version of martial arts that existed before the UFC came along. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=937.0s)]
*  I think we have become so divided. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=943.0s)]
*  You know, you were just the kicker. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=945.0s)]
*  You were just the puncher. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=947.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=948.0s)]
*  It was almost a stylistic civil war going on. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=949.0s)]
*  Like my kung fu could be your kung fu. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=954.0s)]
*  My kicking will be your punching. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=955.0s)]
*  You're like, what? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=956.0s)]
*  What did you start training in? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=957.0s)]
*  I was originally a judo first. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=958.0s)]
*  I did a lot of judo back when I just like when I was 10 to like 16. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=961.0s)]
*  Then I started karate. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=964.0s)]
*  It was like a Kyoko Shinkai, Koko Kondo karate and Japanese Jiu Jitsu. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=965.0s)]
*  Did that all the way till I came to I went to school at USC from Massachusetts and I got here and I bumped in this guy, Burt Richardson, who was a big student under Dan Inosano. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=970.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=979.0s)]
*  And Burt was teaching like just a Kali class, Kali and C-Lot over at USC. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=980.0s)]
*  And I met him and I was a big fan of Dan Inosano from all the Black Belt magazine. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=986.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=990.0s)]
*  So he hooked me up and I got into the Inosano Academy and that's where it went mental. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=991.0s)]
*  We studied with like Francis Fong and Paul Ditois for Indonesian C-Lot. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=996.0s)]
*  We had like every other Filipino instructor you could imagine from that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1000.0s)]
*  We had Francis Asali and I mean Francis and Shannard and Salim Asali for Savat, Surachai Surasut from Muay Thai. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1003.0s)]
*  And then we get these, you know, guest appearances by like all these great martial art instructors. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  And that's awesome. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  And that's where I met this guy, Jeff Amado, who at the time was a very big stunt coordinator. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  And he kind of recruited us into the stunt world from there. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1020.0s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1023.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  So and so then you get into the stunt world. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  You're doing that for years and years. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1027.0s)]
*  And it's just so crazy that John Wick is your first breakthrough movie as a director. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  And it's a fucking gigantic. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  We tried to look for some of those kind of bulletproof. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  We figure very short story. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1039.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1041.0s)]
*  Killed dog guy goes, you know, and then we kind of layered it in with the subtext of grief and suffering and everything. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  It's perfect. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1047.0s)]
*  It was all about the puppy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  Who is the Russian gentleman, the guy who plays the father? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  Michael Nyquist. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1053.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy was so good. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  He was in the original Girl with Dragon Tattoo. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1056.0s)]
*  And I think he did the third Mission Impossible. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  I think he was a bad guy. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  And he died recently, right? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  Yeah, he died a couple of years ago. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1063.0s)]
*  I think he I don't know if it was a heart attack or stroke, but he died. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  He still has a nice charity thing that they do every year for him. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1067.0s)]
*  God, fantastic guy. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  That fucking scene. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  Swedish actor. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  The scene when he's explaining to his son, who's also awesome. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  The guy was in Game of Thrones. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  What is his name? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1079.0s)]
*  Alfie Allen. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  That guy's incredible. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1081.0s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  We cast a lot of Game of Thrones. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1083.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  I used to love Game of Thrones. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1085.0s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  He plays such a good fuckhead. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1087.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1089.0s)]
*  He's such a good prick. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  But in life, it's so funny. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  He is the shyest, quietest, super nice, like hardest, just never left set, always there [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1092.0s)]
*  ready to do his thing. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1097.0s)]
*  The sweetest kid ever. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  Well, I can believe it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1101.0s)]
*  And he just played. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  He's so good at that role. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1104.0s)]
*  But that scene when he's at the bar pouring the drink. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1108.0s)]
*  Explain it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1109.0s)]
*  It's like a little fairy tale of the Baba Yaga. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1110.0s)]
*  Oh, it's such a good scene. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1112.0s)]
*  You know, we were kind of laughing at ourselves. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1113.0s)]
*  We're like, how do we make a movie that people are going to want? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  How do we do something other than the gritty, you know, boring action and stuff like this? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1117.0s)]
*  It's like, we got to do a fairy tale. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  We just got to do a fairy tale. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  We're going to do a campsite fire. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1122.0s)]
*  We're going to have this little fairy tale. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1123.0s)]
*  So we started looking up all these Russian fairy tales. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1125.0s)]
*  Like, we need a cool name. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  Okay, Baba Yaga. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1129.0s)]
*  It's a witch. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1130.0s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1131.0s)]
*  No one will ever know. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  No one will ever see the movie. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1133.0s)]
*  It'd be fine. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  And we're like, oh, fuck. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1135.0s)]
*  It's not the guy. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  We'll work this out. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1138.0s)]
*  But it was like just building like I'm fascinated by mythology. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1139.0s)]
*  So if you can build your own myth, that's what we're just trying to do. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1142.0s)]
*  Like, we're trying to be a little ridiculous. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1145.0s)]
*  That's why we use the color. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1146.0s)]
*  Instead of just noir, black and white, we tried to do like neon noir. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  We had Jonathan Sela and then Dan Laustin, a cinematographer, on it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1152.0s)]
*  And to try and take it and give visual cues to the audience that like this isn't real. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  It's a fairy tale. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1160.0s)]
*  And I'm bored with it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1161.0s)]
*  That's why I see the color differentiation. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  Right when the cop knocks on the door, he goes, hey, you're working again. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1163.0s)]
*  We just switch colors and we're like, OK, hopefully people will get that we're now in a fantasy. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1166.0s)]
*  Well, it just seemed it was it was realistic, but not. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1176.0s)]
*  And just I need one anchor. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1177.0s)]
*  You always need one anchor. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1178.0s)]
*  One of my buddies called me up and he goes, have you seen John Wick? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1179.0s)]
*  I go, no, is it good? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  He goes, dude, did you get that? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1184.0s)]
*  When you get that, dude, you're going to fucking love it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  And then I saw it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1192.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I saw it in the film in the movie theater. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1194.0s)]
*  And I mean, right away I was like, holy shit, this is my kind of movie. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  I mean, this is so much fun. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1201.0s)]
*  It's right. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1202.0s)]
*  It's everyone's kind of an odyssey. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1203.0s)]
*  Like, you know, we all I'm probably the same generation. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1205.0s)]
*  We grew up with like Steve McQueen and Bronson. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1207.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1209.0s)]
*  You know, a little bit. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1210.0s)]
*  We're like not a lot of dialogue, but like, yeah, bullet. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1211.0s)]
*  He's in that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1213.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  Fucking in it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1215.0s)]
*  Fucking we just played the bullet scene the other day. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  I mean, that car scene, no music. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1217.0s)]
*  No, just not all car. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1219.0s)]
*  Just car. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1221.0s)]
*  Just car. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1222.0s)]
*  And that's the real that's what the 68 mustang is just all car. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1223.0s)]
*  68 Fastback. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1227.0s)]
*  Carrying that scene. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1229.0s)]
*  And you're like, that's pretty cool. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  Have you seen the Revology 68 Mustang? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1231.0s)]
*  No. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1233.0s)]
*  Revology makes they make a replica of the bullet. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  But it's with a six suspension with a 460 horsepower Coyote engine and it's [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  lightweight. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1244.0s)]
*  So it's like 600 pounds less than a real Mustang GT from today. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1245.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1249.0s)]
*  You'd be able to throw that around. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1250.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1251.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1253.0s)]
*  He makes it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1254.0s)]
*  We have to check that out. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1255.0s)]
*  That sounds awesome. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1256.0s)]
*  Pull it up. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1257.0s)]
*  I'll show you. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1258.0s)]
*  This is this is what he makes. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1259.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1260.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1261.0s)]
*  That's his car. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1262.0s)]
*  I mean, and it's, you know, fucking zero to 60 in four seconds. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  You know, you can get a six speed or a manual and the fucking car screams. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1267.0s)]
*  It's such a fun car. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1273.0s)]
*  This guy's Tom Scarpello. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1275.0s)]
*  He used to work for Ford. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1278.0s)]
*  He used to be in there, the program to make the Ford GT. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1279.0s)]
*  And so he built this car assembly to get this. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1283.0s)]
*  But he does it. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1287.0s)]
*  The concept is what he does is incredible because he's essentially done it like a [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1288.0s)]
*  production car. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1294.0s)]
*  But it's a brand new 1968 and it's done. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1295.0s)]
*  But it's not just the bullet car. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1299.0s)]
*  He does the 67 GT 500, 67 GT 350. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1301.0s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1307.0s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I mean. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1310.0s)]
*  Again, for all your listeners, you're the one that you're the one that told us to use [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1311.0s)]
*  the 71 Barracuda. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1315.0s)]
*  I'm so excited when I saw it in the previews. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1316.0s)]
*  I was like, yes, he listened. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1319.0s)]
*  No, with context, I bump into you for the first time up at Taron's place. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1321.0s)]
*  And, you know, we got the handshake. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1325.0s)]
*  Hey, you know, how you doing? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1327.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1328.0s)]
*  And it was Joe writes me going, love the movies. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1329.0s)]
*  Where the fuck are the muscle cars? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1332.0s)]
*  Number three. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1334.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, sorry. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1335.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, we'll put one in for the fourth one. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1337.0s)]
*  He's like, you better. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1339.0s)]
*  So we go into production and we're sitting. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1341.0s)]
*  I'm literally sitting in Berlin going, I am fucking looking for cars. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1342.0s)]
*  We're over in Europe. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1345.0s)]
*  I'm going to find a fucking muscle car. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1346.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan is going to fucking hate me. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1347.0s)]
*  I'm like, how do I do this? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1348.0s)]
*  I text you. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1350.0s)]

*  Don't go with any of that pussy 69 stuff. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1354.0s)]
*  71. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1356.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want to get the early Barracuda. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1357.0s)]
*  You want 70 and 71. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  Those are the years. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  That's why you sent me that picture. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1363.0s)]
*  And that's the exact car. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1364.0s)]
*  It's the exact one with the fins. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1365.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1367.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1369.0s)]
*  That is fucking classic. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  We ripped that thing apart like we had Tanner Faust, like one of the best drifters. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1372.0s)]
*  I love that guy. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  Tanner's awesome. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1377.0s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1378.0s)]
*  So he's helped us out on a lot of the John Wick. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1379.0s)]
*  So we brought him into my son, Quinter Scott Rogers and Steve Dunleavy brought him into [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  TG Chicano to do all the 240 and the 360 drifts and all that stuff. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1385.0s)]
*  So he gets right in there. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1389.0s)]
*  They just put the new suspension in, put the fucking insane engine in this thing. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1390.0s)]
*  And they had Quino doing these fucking circular drifts literally like in two weeks. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1394.0s)]
*  It hurts so bad watching you guys smash it up. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  All of them. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  The 69 Mustang and John Wick 2 when he destroys it. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1401.0s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1405.0s)]
*  We destroyed probably a few more than we should have on this one. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1406.0s)]
*  Did you? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1409.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1410.0s)]
*  You got to break a few eggs. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1411.0s)]
*  Well, it worked. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1412.0s)]
*  I mean, how many people went out and bought 69 Mustangs and 70 Chevelles after that fight? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1413.0s)]
*  I actually really enjoyed this Chevelle. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1419.0s)]
*  I didn't like the Chevelle as much as I did. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1421.0s)]
*  I have one. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1423.0s)]
*  I have one just like that. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1425.0s)]
*  Mine's not green, but yours didn't look green. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1426.0s)]
*  It had that like matrix green. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  Very dark green. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1430.0s)]
*  Yeah, but in dark, the way you film everything so dark and moody. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1431.0s)]
*  It's got that kick to it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1435.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  I know I'm supposed to say the Mustang, but I really like the Chevelle. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  I'm a Chevelle guy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  I love the Mustangs too. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1441.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm a muscle car head. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1445.0s)]
*  So it's fun. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1446.0s)]
*  The guys in Europe, when you go shopping around, it's almost you'll find a ... I know there's [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1447.0s)]
*  a lot of people here, but we thought we were going to have a big problem looking for all [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  the different muscle cars in Europe. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1455.0s)]
*  There are amazing collectors over there. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  I love them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1459.0s)]
*  Like warehouses full of ... [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  It makes sense because a lot of Americans collect European cars. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1465.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's the 70 Chevelle in front of the Continental. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  That was kind of on a goof too. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1470.0s)]
*  We wanted something else and we ended up getting this, and we're like, oh my God. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  We just saw one. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1475.0s)]
*  That's the car. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the car. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1477.0s)]
*  We were trying to make a choice and count it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  Just walk away and go, no, that one. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1480.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1483.0s)]
*  Well, it's in the Mount Everest of the muscle car classics, especially the 70. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1484.0s)]
*  Chevelle's weird because the old ones, the 68 and 69 are cool. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  They're really cool. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  70's the motherfucker though. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1495.0s)]
*  Then 71, they go to this goofy single headlight thing. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1496.0s)]
*  It doesn't look right. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  72 looks like shit. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  It softened up. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  They fucked with the rear taillights. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1503.0s)]
*  I think that's what we were really trying to ... You kind of summed it up right there. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1505.0s)]
*  For like the John Wicks, we did it as a goof. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1509.0s)]
*  We thought we'd never direct again. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1513.0s)]
*  We're like, Keanu's like, yeah, let's just do an action movie for us. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1514.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1517.0s)]
*  We're thinking no one's ever going to see it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1518.0s)]
*  We'll just keep our second unit jobs just in case. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1519.0s)]
*  We got this big whiteboard and we went in and we wrote down, okay, everybody take a market. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1522.0s)]
*  Write down the 10 things you fucking hate about action movies. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  Then go write the 10 things you love about action movies that you'd want to see. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1530.0s)]
*  We're like muscle cars, gun food. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1533.0s)]
*  We're like martial arts. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1535.0s)]
*  We're like suits. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  We want to bring the little class back. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1538.0s)]
*  What do we love about Bond? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  What do we love about Mission Impossible? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1541.0s)]
*  What's Cruz doing? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1542.0s)]
*  What's Daniel Craig doing? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1544.0s)]
*  What's Matt doing in Bourne? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1545.0s)]
*  Let's write down all the stuff we love that makes this. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1547.0s)]
*  Then we're just going to mix it up and throw all the stuff. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1549.0s)]
*  I have a museum fetish. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  I have an art fetish, obviously. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1552.0s)]
*  I have a color fetish. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  I have a dog fetish, obviously. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1555.0s)]
*  I'm making something about a dog. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1557.0s)]
*  We had attack dogs on the first one, but it just didn't fit. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1559.0s)]
*  So I can move that over to number three when we have more money. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1562.0s)]
*  It's just like, okay, what's all the fun stuff that you want to see in action movies? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1565.0s)]
*  None of the structures we had in any of the scripts fit for it. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1569.0s)]
*  We're just like, okay, we'll go back to Odysseus in The Iliad or The Odyssey. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1573.0s)]
*  We'll go, okay, this guy just wants to get home. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1578.0s)]
*  He just wants to grieve. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  We're going to throw as many rocks at him as we can on the way and see if we can make obstruction. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1581.0s)]
*  We'll just have Keanu do an endurance race. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1586.0s)]
*  That's kind of how we did it and just threw in everything else we love. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1588.0s)]
*  Well, it's got to be one of the most wild pulse-pounding movies ever. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1591.0s)]
*  Because the scene â I did this thing with my friends. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  We do it every year. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  We do this Sober October thing. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1601.0s)]
*  And one year we did a fitness challenge. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1603.0s)]
*  And my friends Ari Shafir, Bert Kreischer, and Tom Segura and me. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1605.0s)]
*  And Bert Kreischer talks so much shit. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1611.0s)]
*  And the fitness challenge was we all had to wear these heart monitors. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1614.0s)]
*  And it's this thing called MyZones. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1618.0s)]
*  And you have to keep your heart rate at 80%. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1621.0s)]
*  It's like one point per minute. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  At 90%, it's like two points per minute. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  And so it's like â it's the amount of points per day. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1633.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1635.0s)]
*  And I watched John Wick 50 times in a row. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1636.0s)]
*  And I did â no, I'm not bullshitting, man. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1640.0s)]
*  I watched the scene from the bathhouse scene 50 times in a row. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1642.0s)]
*  I did seven hours of cardio. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1647.0s)]
*  And I did it just to try to break Bert because he was talking so much shit. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  And so like a normal score for a day, a guy would get like 400 or 300. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1652.0s)]
*  I got 1,150 for the day. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1657.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1660.0s)]
*  And I put it up just because I'm like I'm going to kill you. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1661.0s)]
*  Because he kept talking shit. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1663.0s)]
*  I go, dude, I'm going to kill you. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1664.0s)]
*  I'm going to drag you to hell. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1666.0s)]
*  I'm like you're not going to be able to keep up. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1668.0s)]
*  I'm going to push myself to the point where I'm almost dead. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1669.0s)]
*  And I'm going to kill you. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1672.0s)]
*  There's probably a study in that, visual stimuli to heart rate and adrenaline. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1674.0s)]
*  So I'm on an elliptical machine watching that scene with a remote control. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1680.0s)]
*  Just on loop. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1685.0s)]
*  Just rewinding it, going back, rewinding it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  That fucking nobody is John Wick. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1688.0s)]
*  And then you go through that killing in the house, get to the red circle bar, assassinations left and right. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1691.0s)]
*  So that just carried me through the whole sober October month. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1698.0s)]
*  That's a psychosomatic study. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1702.0s)]
*  I probably watched that movie a hundred times. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1704.0s)]
*  I'm not bullshitting. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1705.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1706.0s)]
*  I watch it whenever I'm bored in the gym. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1707.0s)]
*  I just throw it on. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1708.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1709.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1710.0s)]
*  That's cool that you can watch it over and over again. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1711.0s)]
*  It's a fucking great get you pumped up movie. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1712.0s)]
*  It was fun to make. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1715.0s)]
*  But we didn't know. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1717.0s)]
*  Honestly, we didn't know what we were doing. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1718.0s)]
*  Did you have any idea it would be so huge though? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1720.0s)]
*  When it was done though, you had to know you nailed it. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1722.0s)]
*  No, we got weird comments back. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1724.0s)]
*  We got like too many headshots, cut out all the headshots. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1726.0s)]
*  We got, you can't kill the kid Alfie Allen and you can't kill the puppy. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  Somebody's got to live. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1732.0s)]
*  We were independent. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1733.0s)]
*  So everyone was scared that we weren't going to get picked up. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1735.0s)]
*  Because we went, when we shopped it, we went to like four or five studios and we didn't even finish the pitch. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1738.0s)]
*  They're like, no, we're cool. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1744.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1746.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1748.0s)]
*  We didn't get bought. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1749.0s)]
*  So we made the thing independently with Thunder Road, with Valzionic and Erica Lee. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1750.0s)]
*  And it wasn't until we came out here actually to Ventastic Fest, like it was behind the movie. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1753.0s)]
*  So that was on the screen. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1757.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  We'll show it at a Ventastic Fest. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1759.0s)]
*  See if anybody will clap. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1760.0s)]
*  So me, Dave and Keanu sneak in real low key. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1761.0s)]
*  We're going to do a little surprise thing at that. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1764.0s)]
*  And Keanu do his little wave to the crowd. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1766.0s)]
*  And the crowd goes fucking mental, like mental. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1769.0s)]
*  And like the first family and friends we had, everyone got was really quiet afterwards. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1773.0s)]
*  Like no applause. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1777.0s)]
*  It was just really quiet. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1778.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1781.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1782.0s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1783.0s)]
*  I just think at the time we were in the fast cut shaky cam and it was, you know, the, the [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1784.0s)]
*  just it was so ludicrous that he's going to kill 68 or 86 people over a puppy. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1789.0s)]
*  And no one got that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1794.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to remember this is how we pitch it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1795.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1798.0s)]
*  So like we'll go to a studio and go, okay, so we got this, we got Keanu Reeves, right? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1799.0s)]
*  I know we're first time stunt guys, but it's an action movie, right? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1801.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  And he's going to shoot all this stuff. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1805.0s)]
*  And so his wife dies of natural causes. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1807.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1809.0s)]
*  The bad guys don't kill it. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1810.0s)]
*  Like, no, no, no, no. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1811.0s)]
*  But they kill his puppy. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1813.0s)]
*  I'm like, yeah. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1815.0s)]
*  And he kills all the people because of the puppy, but not the what? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1816.0s)]
*  Like they're like, what happens next? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1818.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, that's it. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1820.0s)]
*  The next 45 minutes are like just rampage. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1821.0s)]
*  And yeah, yeah, no, we didn't, we didn't sell it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1824.0s)]
*  Boy, they must be kicking themselves now. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1828.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1830.0s)]
*  Well, Lionsgate bought us internationally and then they sold us to domestic. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1831.0s)]
*  And since then, you know, we've gone through a couple of regime changes at Lionsgate, but now like the last one was really cool. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1833.0s)]
*  Like everyone's on board, like Joe Drake, Nathan Cahane, Matt Leonetti, you know, Adam Folkerson, everybody that's part of Regina. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1839.0s)]
*  They really pushed this last one. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1847.0s)]
*  They knew John Wick was cool. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1849.0s)]
*  They loved the third one and they got on board. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1850.0s)]
*  But for the first, first round, we had once we sold the movie came out before it even came out. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1852.0s)]
*  There's like this lag. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1858.0s)]
*  They bought it. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1859.0s)]
*  And then there's like six months before we hit theaters. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1860.0s)]
*  I think Dave went off and did Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 9 or whatever it was. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1862.0s)]
*  I went off and did the Grimsby Brothers or Brothers Grimsby, Sacha Baron Cohen movie, second unit down in South Africa for like five months because I was broke. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1866.0s)]
*  It was pretty funny. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1873.0s)]
*  Yeah, we thought we'd never direct again. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1874.0s)]
*  So we were like, we better go find some stunt jobs. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1876.0s)]
*  And then it worked out. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1880.0s)]
*  And then like not even a month after it had opened, Keanu had called up and go, hey, they called me about doing number two, but only do it with you guys. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1882.0s)]
*  You're in. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1890.0s)]
*  And I was like, are you kidding? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1891.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1892.0s)]
*  We're in. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1893.0s)]
*  Whatever it takes. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1894.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1895.0s)]
*  Completely nutty, man. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  And number two just picks up right where number one left off. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1898.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1900.0s)]
*  And we just like, OK. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1901.0s)]
*  And right off the jump, like opening scene. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1902.0s)]
*  Yeah, we had no idea what to do. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1903.0s)]
*  I was like trying to figure out ideas for that one. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1904.0s)]
*  I got, you know, it's like the the disaster deprivation tank. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1906.0s)]
*  It was just go into a room and not not leave till we came up with an idea. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1909.0s)]
*  So you decided just the hunt for his car. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1913.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1916.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1917.0s)]
*  I was with my now partner, Alex Young. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1918.0s)]
*  We were doing a second unit gig. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1920.0s)]
*  We were doing Agent 47. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1921.0s)]
*  And the second one, whatever that was called, I think it was Agent 47, right? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1923.0s)]
*  In Berlin. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1927.0s)]
*  And we're sitting there and we had got the call to OK, we got to come up with an idea. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1928.0s)]
*  And then my partner at the time, or my partner now, Alex Young was sitting there and he's like, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1932.0s)]
*  you got to get the car back, man. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1937.0s)]
*  He lost his fucking car. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1938.0s)]
*  I'm like, no one's going to care about the car. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1939.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, he was like he's like he fucking total loves muscle cars. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1941.0s)]
*  Like you got to put the car every guy he kills. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1946.0s)]
*  He's going to get a piece of the car back. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1948.0s)]
*  He's getting his fucking car back. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1949.0s)]
*  I'm like, that's a great opening. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1951.0s)]
*  He's going to get the car back. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1953.0s)]
*  No, when he sits in the car and he's like touching the steering wheel. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1954.0s)]
*  You could tell he's like, but that's Keanu. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1957.0s)]
*  Like Keanu brings like that's not just John. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1959.0s)]
*  That's Keanu. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1961.0s)]
*  Keanu loves cars. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1962.0s)]
*  He loves bikes. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1963.0s)]
*  He loves the discipline of it. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1964.0s)]
*  He loves like that's why he's got arch motorcycles, right? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1966.0s)]
*  If you ever get a chance, you should check that shop out. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1968.0s)]
*  It's the most pristine. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1970.0s)]
*  I'm sure I can't fuck with motorcycles. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1972.0s)]
*  I'm scared of them. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1974.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1975.0s)]
*  But to build just to watch how he's got all the water cutters there. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1976.0s)]
*  It's very it's a very artistic. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1979.0s)]
*  Oh, the bikes are incredible. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1981.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1983.0s)]
*  But he brings that to every like he just he's very not compulsory. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1984.0s)]
*  He's very he loves the art of things. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1987.0s)]
*  He loves the art of it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1989.0s)]
*  He's fascinated by like who makes this cup? [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1990.0s)]
*  Joe, like how do you like he everything he just fascinated over. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1993.0s)]
*  He wants a story on it. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1996.0s)]
*  He's one of the most curious most I guess curious artistically like how things are done. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=1998.0s)]
*  Who people are. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2005.0s)]
*  He's just got a genuine curiosity and love for things. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2006.0s)]
*  He's a very unique guy. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2008.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2009.0s)]
*  I've never met him, but it's just every interview you see with him, every movie. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2010.0s)]
*  He's a very unusual person. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2013.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he's got you know what? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2015.0s)]
*  I think I think anybody really artistic or at least the really I think artistic people that I've met, they maintain that little bit of and I mean this in the in the best of ways a little bit of childness wonder. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2016.0s)]
*  They still kids a little bit like I could talk to you all day about like Archery. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2028.0s)]
*  I could talk to you all day about Marsha. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2033.0s)]
*  I talked to you all day about Motorcycle. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2035.0s)]
*  I could talk to you all day about movies. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2036.0s)]
*  And I think that's you got to have that you need that little inspiration. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2038.0s)]
*  I think you need that little bit of wonder, wonder lust into into certain things. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2043.0s)]
*  And I think he still got that like he will still he'll see a sequence will come in with the num chucks and do something and he'll start giggling. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2047.0s)]
*  He's like you want me to do that. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2054.0s)]
*  He's like okay, that's pretty cool. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2055.0s)]
*  And he just goes from totally serious guy to okay. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2057.0s)]
*  Now how do I learn how to do? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2060.0s)]
*  No, he just everything you need to know about numchucks. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2061.0s)]
*  He wants to know about numchucks. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  He just throws himself into it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2065.0s)]
*  So how much time did he have to train martial arts before John Wick won? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2066.0s)]
*  Oh God, it wasn't that he was coming out of a couple films. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2070.0s)]
*  So he hadn't been like he wasn't in fight shape. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2075.0s)]
*  So you know how you know, it's just like you can't just jump back in. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2078.0s)]
*  So we gave him like I think three to five weeks with some of the trainers we found to get into shape to get into shape, you know, cut weight, got himself back in stretched, you know, kind of got back into where he was on the Matrix. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2081.0s)]
*  And then we stuck him with the fight teams and the stunt guys. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2093.0s)]
*  I think we had him within three months. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2097.0s)]
*  That was probably the shortest one we did. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2099.0s)]
*  That was about three months to get him into that shape and teach him all the you know, the Aikido stuff and the Aikijitsu. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2101.0s)]
*  But you need so there's so much going on in those movies physically that you need to be proficient in. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2106.0s)]
*  The gun stuff, the throws, jujitsu, striking, everything. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  The jujitsu was the new thing for him. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2117.0s)]
*  Probably not the most physically demanding, but you know how it is. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2119.0s)]
*  I think the most important thing about it is we used to use your hands and feet. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2121.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you remember the first time you transitioned to jitsu. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2123.0s)]
*  It's like it looks easy, but yeah, completely. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2125.0s)]
*  It's an eye opener. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2129.0s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2130.0s)]
*  And only even recently for me, I'm starting to feel like, oh, I can move. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2131.0s)]
*  It feels just as good to be on my back as my butt. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2135.0s)]
*  But I think we took a lot of inspiration from dance. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  I got, you know, most of what we do is dance. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2141.0s)]
*  They're based on dance drills. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2144.0s)]
*  They're not based on martial arts drills. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2145.0s)]
*  They look like martial arts. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2147.0s)]
*  But we don't train the actors in tie pads or focus mitts or heavy bag. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2148.0s)]
*  We'll do maybe a little of that for impact stuff, but it's mostly about memory. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2151.0s)]
*  Because if a guy can punch and kick, that's great, but if he can't remember five moves, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2155.0s)]
*  you're not much good to him. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  And it's more, you know, martial arts is action, reaction, or causing the guy to be off balance. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  All our guys are trained to keep him on balance, to make it look crazy, but they got to dance with him. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2164.0s)]
*  So it's about that metronome, keeping the beat going. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2170.0s)]
*  So when we trained him, he hadn't been trained that way before. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2174.0s)]
*  It's more about memorizing a few moves, hitting some kind of move. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2177.0s)]
*  Pacific sequence. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2181.0s)]
*  But we realized we had no money and we had no time. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2182.0s)]
*  And every time you do punches and kicks, you see in most movies, right? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2184.0s)]
*  Like they're on you, right, over my shoulder. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2187.0s)]
*  Then, you know, you take the hit and it goes over your shoulder so I can sell the hit. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2189.0s)]
*  So you're always doing these reverses. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2192.0s)]
*  So if I do a big wide shot profile, you throw in a nice roundhouse kick. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  I got to cut somewhere to show the impact, unless you're really kicking me, which is not advisable most of the time. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2197.0s)]
*  So every time, the more punching and kicking, striking you do, or if Kando's not doing the motion, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  I got to cut more. And every time I cut, it's a setup. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2206.0s)]
*  It's just time consuming. Not that it's bad or good. It's just time consuming. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2208.0s)]
*  We knew we weren't going to have that. So we're like, fuck, what do we do? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2213.0s)]
*  Okay, well, we're just going to grab people. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2216.0s)]
*  We're just going to make it all grappling. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2218.0s)]
*  And like, is that going to look, you know, remember, it's all during the born. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  So everything's going to look very slow, you know, compared to what it was. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2223.0s)]
*  But we're going to do all great. We're going to do Aikido, Aikijitsu, or Jiu-Jitsu. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2226.0s)]
*  That's it. That's all you get. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2229.0s)]
*  And if you get a punch, it'll be a contact hit. That's all we're going to do. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2231.0s)]
*  No punches, no kicks, no nothing. And we'll do it all in one take. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2233.0s)]
*  And we're all like, yeah, sounds good. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2236.0s)]
*  Yeah, we thought it was a complete disaster after the first two days of shooting the fight scenes. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2239.0s)]
*  We're like, this is going to suck. We're fucked. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2245.0s)]
*  Why did you think that, though? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2247.0s)]
*  I think it was everyone's mindset. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2249.0s)]
*  Like, we did it out of necessity and we thought it was cool. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2251.0s)]
*  But like, you'd see people that would, where's the kick? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2253.0s)]
*  Like, you know, sometimes people look at it and go, well, he's doing the same throw over. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2255.0s)]
*  I mean, Ipon Sayanagi looks the same. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2259.0s)]
*  But for us, the different grips, the different throw, it all looks different to me. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2261.0s)]
*  Like, I'm a throw. You know, I love judo porn. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2264.0s)]
*  I could watch a million different throws. It's awesome. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  For some people, it all looks the same. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2270.0s)]
*  They want to see the cool jump, spin, hook kick or something like that. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2273.0s)]
*  But then we put in the close quarter stuff. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2276.0s)]
*  And when you're seeing it, remember, we don't have the muzzle flashes on. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2278.0s)]
*  We don't have the blood splatters. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2280.0s)]
*  So you're just kind of seeing, you know, it looks like they're dancing. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2282.0s)]
*  And then you put in the sound effects and you put in the muzzle. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2285.0s)]
*  And then you put in the fucking reload. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2287.0s)]
*  And like now it's making sense. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2289.0s)]
*  So what do you when when he's shooting in the actual filming, is he just pulling the trigger and it's just going click? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  Well, see, that's the thing. You have dummy rounds when you when you most movies always see A to B cutting, right? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2297.0s)]
*  I'm on you. You're the guy. Like guns in the camera. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2302.0s)]
*  You fire the blank. Most firearms up until very recently fire blanks. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2305.0s)]
*  And for the people out there, a blank is around without the actual bullet, the lead piece that hits. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2309.0s)]
*  But a blank still has a gunpowder charge in it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2314.0s)]
*  Say maybe, you know, even if it's only 50 grams of black powder, but at a range of 10 to 15 feet, that'll still that can kill you. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2317.0s)]
*  Yeah. Concussive force. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2324.0s)]
*  That's when you hear about all the accidents that have happened with blanks over the years. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2325.0s)]
*  Like you can't put a blank under your head and pull the trigger. Right. Right. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2329.0s)]
*  So we want to do all this close quarter shooting. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  We wanted to put the muzzle and do all this stuff. Close quarter contact stuff. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2335.0s)]
*  So we you know, we went to our VFX guys and the trick is not so much the muzzle flash. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2339.0s)]
*  It's a lighting interaction, especially at night, and it's cycling the automatic. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2345.0s)]
*  Yeah. Getting it in and having the casing ejection. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2348.0s)]
*  All do, but it can add up with visual effects costs. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2350.0s)]
*  So we went and we found the armors and, you know, through Taron and the other the technologies that we found through the armors, we made a plug gun. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2353.0s)]
*  A plug gun is a gun that has a almost a steel rod inside the barrel and it kicks the gas a different way. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2360.0s)]
*  So we still have an ejection, but nothing. No energy, no flash, no padding or wadding comes out the barrel. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2365.0s)]
*  Like, you know, you couldn't put a live round it in if you tried. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2371.0s)]
*  So is it a lower lower level? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2374.0s)]
*  It there in England, they use some that are like almost air contained. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2377.0s)]
*  They can do it. And it's a very, very small charge of black powder. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2381.0s)]
*  So it's a very, very we call them plug guns. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2385.0s)]
*  They're very, very limited in the greenage. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  So it's just enough to cycle around and cycle it up and nothing. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2391.0s)]
*  Yeah. Exiting, but nothing comes out the barrel. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2395.0s)]
*  So all that stuff, you see the blood splatter, that's all CGI. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2398.0s)]
*  The blood is all CG. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2401.0s)]
*  There's one or two instances where it's not. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2402.0s)]
*  But most of the blood is the blood so good nowadays digitally that it saves so much time. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2404.0s)]
*  So we have to change the word over. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2408.0s)]
*  Get it. I mean, like, you know, you seem like a Tarantino like in Django Tarantino still uses old school blood packs, which I mean, I'm old school. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2409.0s)]
*  I fucking love that. I think it's amazing. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2416.0s)]
*  But with just the time and, you know, you like you see a John Wick movie. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2418.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, the reset on 20 stunt guys taking hits. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2421.0s)]
*  It'd be a three hour reset to change the wardrobe. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2424.0s)]
*  Right. And headshots. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2426.0s)]
*  You'd have to put a special head pack on with a wig and all that stuff. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2427.0s)]
*  So we do we do the blood hits digitally. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  The muzzle flashes, we actually shoot against a green screen and we'll call them elements and then we'll plug actual muzzle flashes back into the movie later on. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2433.0s)]
*  So they're not digital per se, but they are comped in or in a composition. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2441.0s)]
*  And that's how we get the cool lighting effect and keep the cool muzzle flashes. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2445.0s)]
*  How long did it take you to film that red circle bar scene? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2448.0s)]
*  I think less than four days. Really? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2452.0s)]
*  Yeah, we went really fast. And Kano was he had the flu. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2454.0s)]
*  He had like a 103 degree fever. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2456.0s)]
*  He was going down. It was it was a rough day. It was freezing cold New York. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2458.0s)]
*  He had the flu, super high temperature and we were just flying through it like literally two, three takes. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2462.0s)]
*  Move on to three. Take filming it with the flu. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2467.0s)]
*  Wow. Yeah, he's a trooper, man. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2470.0s)]
*  He's wow. That's incredible. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2472.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's a tough fucker. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2474.0s)]
*  Actors have a fucking earache. They'll call it quits for the day. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2476.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No comment. No comment. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2479.0s)]
*  But like most of the people we work with, they get it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2482.0s)]
*  And we try to be smart, too. Look, if we if there's another way, if we could have shut down and let them, we just it was like one of those. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2484.0s)]
*  We either got to stop or we don't. We only get one shot. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2492.0s)]
*  You couldn't have. Kano's that guy, too. You can't you can't make him. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2495.0s)]
*  Where did you film that? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2499.0s)]
*  It was on New York City. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2500.0s)]
*  But the red circle, where was it? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2501.0s)]
*  It was in this little it was up in the theater district. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2502.0s)]
*  I forget the name of it was a shut down little club that we just kind of opened back up and put our own put our own lighting rig in there and just kind of lit it up. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2504.0s)]
*  I mean, if you had seen it in the daytime, it was all like that shit brown leather. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2513.0s)]
*  It looked like you're walking into like, you know, big boys. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2517.0s)]
*  So then it looked really bad. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2520.0s)]
*  That gives credit to John Sela, the cinematographer on the first one. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2522.0s)]
*  We went in, put our lighting grid up, flashed a lot of big screen lights, put the extras in funny colors. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2524.0s)]
*  And, you know, we ran out of money. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2532.0s)]
*  So we're like, we didn't we didn't know how to put the bad guys in some sort of like, OK, what would Star Trek do in Star Trek? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2534.0s)]
*  We always call them the red shirts. You know, the guys in Star Trek that were always getting killed. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2539.0s)]
*  You have to do is when they're right there, Kirk was transported down to the planet with the red shirt guy. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2543.0s)]
*  That guy was gone. So we put all our bad guys in the red shirts. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2547.0s)]
*  They were just going to kill them all. I think we had a deal. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2550.0s)]
*  There's a local like one of the garment district things. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2553.0s)]
*  I think we got all those red shirts for like ten bucks. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2556.0s)]
*  It's like a whole deal. All the stunt guys, red shirts. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2559.0s)]
*  But yeah, we did it all in this shitty little club in like 40, maybe four and a half days. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2562.0s)]
*  And this has got to be very stressful for you to be first time director doing all this and then so much pressure. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2567.0s)]
*  And also, it's not picked up by anybody. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2574.0s)]
*  It you know, it's weird. I guess when you're in it, you're just trying to just go into that mode of don't suck. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2577.0s)]
*  Like you don't have to win. You just can't lose. Just finish. Get the day. Do your thing. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2582.0s)]
*  My partner, Dave Leach, at the time, like, you know, we both were so we just love being on set. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2587.0s)]
*  So I think we just it was kind of straight, you know, you come from the action, you say, oh, these guys can do action and you can do that. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2593.0s)]
*  But when you're trying to put the storytelling in, you're trying to do that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2600.0s)]
*  I mean, you might get other guys you'll talk to or guys that come from the stunt world and say, yeah, it's just like doing it. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2603.0s)]
*  For me, it was nothing like second unit. Completely different. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2608.0s)]
*  It had that different kind of pressure. But like, I guess you see how things come together more. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2612.0s)]
*  You know, you just do the action. You're worried about just making it look cool. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2618.0s)]
*  You're trying to do something like it's kind of review. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2621.0s)]
*  You have Ian McShane, you have Willem Dafoe, Lance Reddick, and you're kind of going, oh, I don't know. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2623.0s)]
*  Who was the badass Russian guy that Keanu gets in a fight with and throws him off the bat? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2628.0s)]
*  That's Daniel Bernhardt. That's a good. He was the star of Bloodsport 2 and Bloodsport 3. Pull that one up. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2634.0s)]
*  No kidding. Yeah. After Von Dom, Daniel was this he's a Swiss actor. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2640.0s)]
*  That's Daniel Bernhardt. He's very good. He's awesome. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2645.0s)]
*  He's a good, good, good close friend. But I had worked with him. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2648.0s)]
*  He had hired me as a stunt guy when he was the lead actor in Bloodsport 2, Bloodsport 3, Bloodsport 4 or 5. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2651.0s)]
*  I don't know. They go on forever. Right. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2657.0s)]
*  But when it was time to do this, we called in every favor we had. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2659.0s)]
*  And, you know, like that whole lower budget. That's how we got Scott Atkinson, Mark Dacascos and Gary Daniels and Daniel Bernhardt. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2662.0s)]
*  All these Mark Zerror, all these great, you know, up and coming action actors. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2669.0s)]
*  My friend Tate Fletcher was in it too. Tate was with the beard. We swam. Tate's awesome. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2673.0s)]
*  Like he had that beard and we're like, what are we doing? Oh, we got a courtyard for the beard. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2677.0s)]
*  We slam down and shoot him in the head. Tate's awesome, man. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2680.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've known Tate forever. He's a great guy. He's awesome. Good stunt guy too. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2683.0s)]
*  And he's a really good actor. He's got the eyes. Like he can pop those eyes out. He's fantastic. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2687.0s)]
*  But you look for those guys, right? You put them in the cool spots. Yeah. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2692.0s)]
*  But this fucking estate, this whole scene is just so fun. It's such a crazy scene. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2695.0s)]
*  Come on. That's a real beard there, by the way. Yeah, that's his real beard. He's awesome. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2702.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, super fun. I mean, that's always a trick. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2707.0s)]
*  But like if you get the people you like around you, they kind of give you a hint. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2711.0s)]
*  So we had a lot of we called in a lot of favors and a lot of friends and, you know, they all know it's your first time. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2714.0s)]
*  Like the crew and the cast, like Ian McShane, everybody kind of knew Keanu had gone out. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2720.0s)]
*  Keanu had one day off on John Wick 1. And, you know, New York City base camp is like blocks away from the set. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2725.0s)]
*  So me and my partner, Dave Leach, it's Ian McShane's first day on set. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2732.0s)]
*  So it's like four in the morning. We're going to walk over to his trailer, introduce ourselves, say hi. How you doing? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2737.0s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of a big deal for us. Keanu's sitting outside his trailer at like 430 in the morning. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2741.0s)]
*  It's one day off. I'm like, what are you doing here? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2746.0s)]
*  He's like, I just thought he'd come in early and talk to Ian and, you know, warm up for you a little bit. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2748.0s)]
*  And we're like, that's what kind of guy is. So he kind of greased the wheels for us. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2753.0s)]
*  He walks in and, you know, Ian's like, so here's your first movie. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2756.0s)]
*  Don't worry, we'll get you through it. You know, everybody was so cool because we just kind of admitted we didn't know what we're doing. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2761.0s)]
*  And we wanted to learn and get our thing going. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2766.0s)]
*  How difficult is it to take the dailies and then edit it down to a film like the editing process? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2769.0s)]
*  You know, to put the assembly together, to actually just put clips together, it's not that hard. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2776.0s)]
*  I mean, good, bad, you know, you could take a couple of shots at it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2782.0s)]
*  It's to, and you don't know this until you try it a couple of times. It's like, where's the actual, like how much can you take away? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2785.0s)]
*  It's like chipping away at the statue, right? It's not adding things. It's taking away things to really shine what's good. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2791.0s)]
*  You know, lose some of the good to get to the great. So you don't want to cut your action. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2797.0s)]
*  You don't want to cut any scenes, but then you watch the movie as a whole. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2800.0s)]
*  And this is what I'd say to any other editor or directors out there that are just getting started. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2803.0s)]
*  If you just edit a scene or you just edit a sequence or you just edit like an act and then watch it and go, I got it, I got it. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2808.0s)]
*  You still haven't got it because there's this thing we've all felt it in movies about pacing, right? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2815.0s)]
*  There's a way a three hour movie can feel like two hours is a way a one hour movie can feel like three hours. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2819.0s)]
*  It's all about the pacing, right? So what I learned from it is you got to sit and every time you make when you're in that place, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2823.0s)]
*  you can just make these one minute or two minute changes. You got to take the time, sit back and watch the whole thing. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2829.0s)]
*  No P breaks, no fucking calls. And that's what we did on WIC 4. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2835.0s)]
*  A lot of us like everyone kept telling me it's too long. I know, but let's just watch it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2839.0s)]
*  And my editorial would hate me because like twice a week we're like everybody's watching it. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2843.0s)]
*  You know, like we're watching this and you have to sit and get through the two and a half hours of it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2847.0s)]
*  And that's the only way you know. And then you're like, still, we're not there. This is too fast. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2851.0s)]
*  But is it hard to when you're in the middle of it, is it hard to see it? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2855.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2860.0s)]
*  Because you've seen it so many times. Is it hard to see it the way another person is going to see it? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2861.0s)]
*  It's like it's like knowing you're lost, but also not being nervous by it. It's being lost in a good way because you can feel it, right? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2865.0s)]
*  You can feel there's something cool there and you can feel like I just go back to being an audience member. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2874.0s)]
*  What do I wish I had seen? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2879.0s)]
*  Push that microphone up to your face. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2880.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2881.0s)]
*  That's OK. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2882.0s)]
*  You know, you're trying to trying to figure it out, right? And that's that's the exciting part. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2883.0s)]
*  You know, there's something tingly there. You know, there's something good. But what is it? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2887.0s)]
*  It's kind of you can't be afraid to try because now digitally we can go back and forth and have 20 versions of the movie. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2890.0s)]
*  It's not like the old days. We cut film and glue it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2898.0s)]
*  So we would always make a new we try. I've always had good editors. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2900.0s)]
*  I've always had young, hungry, great, great editors that wanted to experiment. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2905.0s)]
*  They swing big. So let's just can we do this movie now in 20 minutes and they'll do a version of it. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2910.0s)]
*  Can we do this out? Can we do this in our 45? What's the version of it? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2915.0s)]
*  And you'll start to see things that you obviously hate, but you also see choices that you could make to tighten things up. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2918.0s)]
*  It's I'm sure everybody you talk to will have a different process. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2924.0s)]
*  But like I think it's both terrifying and exciting. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2927.0s)]
*  And again, it's hard to explain. You can feel like you're on the right path even though you don't know it. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2930.0s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2936.0s)]
*  And you just have to keep trying till you watch it in the room with the sound and you're like, that's it. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2937.0s)]
*  That's the movie. I want to. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2943.0s)]
*  Did you bring in people that hadn't seen it before? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2944.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a big fan of like friends and family stuff. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2946.0s)]
*  And like you at first you're going to your ego may not be ready because like everybody likes something else. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2950.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks something should be cut. Everybody thinks it's too much blood or not enough blood. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2957.0s)]
*  I literally in the same day I've had some of our, you know, some of our female friends came in and wanted more action. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2961.0s)]
*  Some of our guy friends were like, we want less action. Like you just couldn't tell what people wanted. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2970.0s)]
*  But you listen to what they all love. And that was the cool thing. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2976.0s)]
*  They all love Keanu. They all cried when the puppy died. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2980.0s)]
*  They all felt it was something they hadn't really seen before. It was action in a different way. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2983.0s)]
*  They like the mythology part of it. They like the color. They like the sound. They thought it was all very well made. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2990.0s)]
*  I mean, whether you like it or not, you know, like the crew is really good, you know, that kind of thing. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2995.0s)]
*  And that's what sticks with you. But like I now I'll show my movie. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=2999.0s)]
*  I love showing it because I love it. I like it. I get some of the most insane comments. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3003.0s)]
*  It's pretty funny. Like even the reviews like Keanu, I have this little thing like, you know, I know I've talked to some director friends that don't read reviews. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3008.0s)]
*  We read like everyone like masochistic about it. You know, like everything on Rotten Tomatoes or Honest Trailers or Everything Wrong With or like, you know, the critical drinker. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3017.0s)]
*  All these great guys on YouTube are just fucking hammering us on little shit. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3028.0s)]
*  And we're kind of laughing because like, OK, fair game. You're right. We're a little over the top. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3032.0s)]
*  But it's very interesting to see what grabs people because partly you're kind of like, OK, what's working? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3036.0s)]
*  You just can't let it direct you, really. You know, you don't want to chase the dragon of what other people want. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3041.0s)]
*  You want to do the movie that you want. And hopefully people like it. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3046.0s)]
*  But it's very interesting to see what what does touch because I mean, you know, it's the only true north you have is what you like and what you're interested in. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3049.0s)]
*  And that's how you drive your show. And that's what makes the show unique because it's from you. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3056.0s)]
*  You start doing what you thought was popular, what everybody wanted to see. And it didn't work. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3059.0s)]
*  How do you course correct? You don't know because it's not you anymore. Right. Yeah. And that's just kind of what we try to do. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3064.0s)]
*  Yeah, that becomes a real problem with people that pay too much attention to criticisms or comments. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3070.0s)]
*  Well, you can get lost in the middle of that's actually just talking to a friend the other night that he said he thinks about negative comments while he's writing his jokes. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3075.0s)]
*  I don't. Yeah, I don't know if that's productive in the right way. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3086.0s)]
*  I think it's OK to be aware of it. But I certainly wouldn't want to. I don't want to sit on a write a movie base. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3089.0s)]
*  Well, hey, you know, how many sequels have you seen where they bring back the same cast over and over again or the same jokes or the same gag or the same because they think it works. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3094.0s)]
*  You better not fuck with it. Right. OK. That's great. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3103.0s)]
*  And a lot of businesses. But in entertainment, I don't think that's going to push or move the needle. Right. The way we need to do it. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3106.0s)]
*  I think we got to take chances. Right. Otherwise, what are we doing? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3113.0s)]
*  Well, you created one interesting things about the whole WIC franchise is that you've created this universe, this universe of the continental, this universe of all these different rules that this group of assassins has. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3117.0s)]
*  And now you have this opportunity with that to do so many other things because you have like a whole world. We have tea for you there if you want. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3131.0s)]
*  Thanks. I guess that's you know, we created the world based on stuff that we had done. You know, being a stunt guy, you travel around, you live in hotels all the time. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3139.0s)]
*  Thanks. Yeah. Wouldn't be cool if the concierge gave you a firearm. That'd be great. You know, if they had a gun range downstairs instead of a gym, that'd be fantastic. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3146.0s)]
*  But it's also like I mean, again, if you made your list of the top 10 things you want to see in movies, you know, you have dogs, ninjas, muscle cars, guns, archery, right? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3155.0s)]
*  You know, sword fight, you know, and then you made a list of the top 10 people you'd want to see. I want to see Donnie Yen fight Steve McQueen do Bruce Lee on Schwarzenegger. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3163.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, we just tried to create a franchise where we could put all that stuff in and no one would call us on it because there's no I mean, you know, we've been called for the superhero movies and all the other stuff, which are all interesting. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3170.0s)]
*  And I'm a big fan. I just don't think that's what I'd be good at. Right. You know, I think a little crazier mindset of what's not being done. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3180.0s)]
*  How do we get that in? Like, you know, the old Shoukatsuji movies, you know, Enter the Ninja or something like that, or Chuck Norris's Invasion USA, like, you know, things that were kind of so nutty and wacky. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3190.0s)]
*  But like, you know, they hit a chord. So how do we bring that back in just a and I don't want to say a cool way, but like a more modern or technically more, I guess, more developed way. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3201.0s)]
*  That's why we spend so much time on the look of the John wicks. Like we want people to take the action like, look, we're trying to do a good job here. Not just trying to phone it in. But the same time, we do want to be a little crazy. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3213.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, how many dog bites to the crotch that I do? Quite a few. You know how long it takes a train built in Malawans to bite a crotch? Does it take a lot? No, actually about a day. It takes a stunt guy a lot longer to get used to being bitten in the crotch. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3221.0s)]
*  What do you do to pad their crotch? You give them like a... [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3236.0s)]
*  We have these cool little Kevlar suits. It's funny, right? Andrew, our dog trainer, when I first told him, he's the guy that trains all the wolves for Game of Thrones. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3238.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3249.0s)]
*  So I called him and said, like, I have dogs myself. And, you know, you play with the dog, he's got a little ball and you have the little tug of war fight with him. I was like, I want to do that. How do I do that? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3250.0s)]
*  Because like, I don't know if people will see that when you normally up until very recently, if you see a dog attack at a movie, that's a dog attacking a human. The dog doesn't know it's a fucking movie. The dog is just attacked. The dog is literally trying to hurt that person on camera. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3261.0s)]
*  It's not good for the dog. It's not good for the person. Those professional animal trainers wearing a bite suit that, you know, all fucking Kevlar pad. You've seen them. It's bulky. It's like a suit of armor. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3276.0s)]
*  And the dog just goes to kill him. We didn't think that was such a brilliant idea and the way we wanted to do things. So it's like there's got to be another way to train dogs because I can train my dogs just to wrestle with me. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3285.0s)]
*  So what we do is we take these long cylindrical pads, bite pads that are painted green screen green, right? And they're Velcroed on one side with a rip cord like the parachute rip cord. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3294.0s)]
*  So they're laced onto the the either the forearm, the crotch, the leg, the calf, wherever we want the dog to bite. And the dog's been trained to attack green. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3306.0s)]
*  So you can't you can't wear green on set. Holy shit. So we've got the dog trained to attack these green bite pads and the dogs. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3314.0s)]
*  That's why we go out. Andrew finds the Belgians that seem to have the most promise and they're trained to wrestle. They're not trained to attack. They're not trained to kill or to bite. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3327.0s)]
*  They're trained to wrestle. They have fun. So the dogs think it's now fun. So we're training them. You know, when usually when a dog wrestles with you over a bone, you know, down boy down. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3337.0s)]
*  We've encouraged it. So the dog is actually having fun. So it's not mentally traumatic on the animal. So it's fun. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3345.0s)]
*  So the stunt guys go in, they go in for their martial art training and their physical training, Keanu and whoever else we're working with. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3352.0s)]
*  And for an hour and a half a day, each stunt guy that work with the animal has to go in because the dog has to recognize you, has to smell you, has to get used to the camera guys. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3357.0s)]
*  Everybody that's around dogs has to go play basically just an hour of play. So the stunt guys go in, put the gear on and they wrestle with the dog for the hour. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3363.0s)]
*  And then the dog gets used to them and we put the wherever it's got to go. And then we have these really cool sleeves that have a little bit of a bite proof ethephone in it covered with a really soft pad so the dog doesn't hurt his teeth. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3372.0s)]
*  And the dog will go in and bite and Belgians once they clamp, that's why they call them like malligators, once they bite, they don't let go. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3386.0s)]
*  So we had to figure out a way to get them off when we yell cut because they're so angst about getting the attempt. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3394.0s)]
*  So you have the rip cord going so we yell cut, the stunt guy would pull the rip cord, the pad would release, the dog would hold the pad, walk away with it and just hold on to it for the next five minutes until he got tired and just would drop the pad. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3399.0s)]
*  So we had five Belgians and then we just wrote to every take was a new dog because the other one had let the pad go. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3410.0s)]
*  And what did Halle Berry have to do? How much? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3417.0s)]
*  Well we figured since just like we did with Shamir Anderson this one, you can't have it because we're so wide we couldn't have a trainer you know right behind the couch telling the dog. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3419.0s)]
*  So we just, Andrew and I had talked about well let's just raise the dogs for the next six months with the cast. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3428.0s)]
*  So Halle for like I think it was almost eight and a half months actually, Halle would come in and she learned to train them. She'd carry the little treats and so they listened to the two Belgians that were her number three. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3435.0s)]
*  There's actually four of them but the two that were always on camera, like she literally trained from scratch. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3447.0s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3452.0s)]
*  So they obeyed, like they were like her dogs. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3453.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3455.0s)]
*  And they listened to every word she said. Like she'd just snap her fingers and they'd be like boom. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3456.0s)]
*  But it got crazy to the point where, that's Andrew back there, but yeah. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3459.0s)]
*  I mean if you came over to Halle, you know, and the dogs were there, they'd give you the eye like what are you doing next to my master? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3464.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're intense dogs. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3472.0s)]
*  They're so brilliant. But they look at you, they sort things out. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3474.0s)]
*  Yeah, the team guys call them meat missiles. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3477.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3479.0s)]
*  They fly. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3480.0s)]
*  Like we've played so many videos of Belgian Malawas running up hills. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3482.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3486.0s)]
*  Just jumping over walls and like they literally can fly through the air. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3487.0s)]
*  That's really one of the Belgians that ran up the wall in that movie. That was like a 13 and a half foot thing. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3491.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. They are such athletes. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3496.0s)]
*  And the funny thing, they're not huge, but it is a real 65 to 75 pound animal. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3498.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3504.0s)]
*  And I think the funniest thing when we're bringing in a new stunt team and we've got the, like before we even do anything, you line them up and you let the dogs go in. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3505.0s)]
*  And everyone says they're good with dogs or I'm a dog person until you see that, you see the dog attack on camera. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3513.0s)]
*  If you were to turn that camera around, what you see are two trainers holding this dog back and the thing is like ready to go. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3519.0s)]
*  It's a whole other level of animal behavior. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3527.0s)]
*  And you can see who gets a little shaky. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3528.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3529.0s)]
*  And who's comfortable. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3530.0s)]
*  Dave Camrio, who we were talking about earlier, who trained Keanu for the Judo and the Jiu-Jitsu in number four, I think he did over a hundred dog hits. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3531.0s)]
*  He was just, he, for whatever reason, Crazy Dave and the dogs bonded and they were both, they spoke the same language. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3539.0s)]
*  They loved, they loved him. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3548.0s)]
*  So whenever we needed a dog hit, it's Dave. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3550.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3553.0s)]
*  And he was so bad because he was so, I don't know if you, like he's so calm. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3554.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3557.0s)]
*  And the dogs vibe on that. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3558.0s)]
*  And even when they're going, they just, they're just, yeah, go play with Dave and Dave wrestled with him. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3559.0s)]
*  I think he had done so many by the end of the movie counting him a special t-shirt of just like 109 dog hits or something. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3564.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3569.0s)]
*  But like the surprise is the first time you see the stunt man get hit by the dog is that, you know, it doesn't look that big until 75 pounds hit you at 20 miles an hour. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3571.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3581.0s)]
*  And then they all get up with the same eyes of like, what just happened? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3585.0s)]
*  It's pretty impressive. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3586.0s)]
*  We use those on Fear Factor. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3587.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3588.0s)]
*  To attack people. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3589.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3590.0s)]
*  But unfortunately we found that they're too light. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3591.0s)]
*  So like with really heavy people, really strong people, well they'd get bit and they could carry the dog as they ran. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3599.0s)]
*  And so then we moved to mastiffs. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3600.0s)]
*  Which are not small. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3602.0s)]
*  We had this animal called a Regency Mastiff that's part pit bull, part Neapolitan. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3604.0s)]
*  And this guy had bred them specifically so they don't show any animal aggression. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3610.0s)]
*  And when they bite, it's just, it's horrific. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3616.0s)]
*  They're 150, 160 pounds. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3620.0s)]
*  Exactly, right. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3621.0s)]
*  And they're just built like an athlete. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3622.0s)]
*  What did they have to do? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3624.0s)]
*  Just attack them and then they had to walk with them? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3625.0s)]
*  Yeah, well the people, with the mastiffs there was a room and they had to enter into the room and they had to perform a very specific task. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3627.0s)]
*  I don't remember what it was. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3635.0s)]
*  But as soon as they get into the room, they're wearing a bite suit and nobody got past it. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3636.0s)]
*  No. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3640.0s)]
*  The dog's name is Curly. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3641.0s)]
*  The dog, they used the dog for the original, one of the Hulk movies, the one with Eric Bana. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3642.0s)]
*  Those were the dogs, they modeled it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3648.0s)]
*  And when Nick Nolte, that's it right there. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3651.0s)]
*  See the original dog though, see if they can find the original dog. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3654.0s)]
*  The original dog is this, just Google Regency Mastiff, see if you can find that. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3658.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3668.0s)]
*  See if there's any images. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3669.0s)]
*  So those are the dogs in the Hulk, but the actual, yeah that's what they looked like. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3674.0s)]
*  They look like giant pit bulls. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3678.0s)]
*  Yeah, they have the jaw that goes out to here. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3681.0s)]
*  But they're so sweet, like really calm. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3682.0s)]
*  I actually had one of their dogs. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3684.0s)]
*  I had a Curly's son. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3686.0s)]
*  His name is Johnny Cash. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3688.0s)]
*  He lived a long time. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3690.0s)]
*  He lived like 13 years, which is really old for a Mastiff. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3693.0s)]
*  For a big dog like that. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3696.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3697.0s)]
*  But yeah, so the Malmois, they were just a little too light. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3698.0s)]
*  Because like with the bite suit on, it hurts, but it's 65 pounds. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3702.0s)]
*  You can run with 65 pounds. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3706.0s)]
*  It's like a suit of armor. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3708.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3709.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3710.0s)]
*  I think they were three of them. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3711.0s)]
*  So how long did Halle Berry have to train for that move? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  Because she had so many physical, first of all, she's awesome. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3716.0s)]
*  She's so good at that movie. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3720.0s)]
*  She's great. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3721.0s)]
*  She's so believable. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3722.0s)]
*  And she's so like physically adept. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3723.0s)]
*  Like I had no idea she could move like that. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3725.0s)]
*  No, I think she, and she came to, she came, I hadn't even written the script yet. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3728.0s)]
*  You know, I just got a call from WME and my agent saying, hey, would you like to meet Halle Berry? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3732.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, of course. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3738.0s)]
*  Yeah, huge fan. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3740.0s)]
*  I think she was down either that day or the next day just banging on my door. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3741.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3745.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, okay. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3746.0s)]
*  Open it up. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3747.0s)]
*  She's like, she just walks in, jeans and a t-shirt goes, hi, I'm Halle. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3748.0s)]
*  I was like, yes, I know who you are. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3751.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3753.0s)]
*  She's like, I want to be in your movie. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3754.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3757.0s)]
*  It was that, she was that straightforward. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3758.0s)]
*  No bullshit. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  No, that's not. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3761.0s)]
*  I'm going to be in your movie. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3762.0s)]
*  And I'm like, that's, I'm flattered. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3763.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3765.0s)]
*  That's very cool of you. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3766.0s)]
*  We haven't even written it yet. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3767.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3768.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to come here now. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3769.0s)]
*  You're going to write it for me. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3770.0s)]
*  And I'm just laughing. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3771.0s)]
*  That's some serious confidence. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3772.0s)]
*  Yeah, she was right on. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3773.0s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, cool. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3774.0s)]
*  Let me give it a think. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3775.0s)]
*  We'll figure out something. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3776.0s)]
*  And now I'm like, oh, I got to write something cool for Halle Berry. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3777.0s)]
*  But it was like, I think three or four months later, I was like, okay, you can come back [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3778.0s)]
*  in now. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3779.0s)]
*  She's like, that's awesome. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3780.0s)]
*  It's great. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3781.0s)]
*  Change this. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3782.0s)]
*  I see it more like this. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3783.0s)]
*  Okay, we're going to do this ode to Casablanca. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3784.0s)]
*  So I'm going to be like, Rick, I got it. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3785.0s)]
*  I'm going to do this. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3786.0s)]
*  And she's like, when do I start trading? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3787.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, you know, technically we go into, she's like, no, just I'm going to start [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3788.0s)]
*  training today. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3800.56s)]
*  Just tell me what to do. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3801.56s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3802.56s)]
*  She was so on it. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3803.56s)]
*  Just on. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3804.56s)]
*  I was like, okay, well, first let's get you in shape. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3805.56s)]
*  Tell your trainer this is what we need to do. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3807.08s)]
*  We need you to stretch. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3808.36s)]
*  We need you to get all the conditioning stuff in so we can start taking you in. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3809.36s)]
*  And we literally had to slow her down the first week. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3814.4s)]
*  Like, you know, if you haven't done shoulder rolls, if you haven't been thrown before, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3817.2400000000002s)]
*  if you haven't done this stuff, you're going to pull something. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3819.7200000000003s)]
*  So she just went crazy the first week. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3821.96s)]
*  We couldn't kick her out of the gym. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3824.52s)]
*  She's another Keanu. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3825.52s)]
*  You just couldn't get rid of her. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3826.52s)]
*  She was in the gym all the time. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3828.52s)]
*  She's like, put her up at Terrence and like, she just lived it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3829.92s)]
*  Just lived it up there. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3833.12s)]
*  She'd go with Keanu. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3834.12s)]
*  She's like, whenever Keanu goes, I'm going. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3835.12s)]
*  So just make room for me. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3836.12s)]
*  After that movie, did she ever want to do it again? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3838.04s)]
*  Yeah, we were actually been in talks several times to try and get, I hate the term spin [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3840.0s)]
*  off, but they're trying to do other satellite projects off the WIC franchise, which it's [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3844.72s)]
*  very flattering. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3849.3999999999996s)]
*  Hopefully they'll be good ones. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3850.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't believe John Wick is dead. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3852.68s)]
*  Is John dead or is John Wick dead? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3856.3199999999997s)]
*  We don't know. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3858.48s)]
*  We just don't know. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3859.48s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3860.48s)]
*  Because it was very ambiguous at the end of the movie. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3864.2799999999997s)]
*  It's supposed to be. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3866.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3867.64s)]
*  We'll see. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3868.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3869.64s)]
*  We'll see how Keanu and the director feel in three, four years. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3870.64s)]
*  You've got to take them to that bar in Japan and get them drunk. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3872.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3875.0s)]
*  When we're going in September. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3876.0s)]
*  So you talk to me again then. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3877.0s)]
*  It could be John Wick five and a half. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3878.0s)]
*  You never know. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3880.0s)]
*  But Halle wants to do, she's definitely still getting. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3881.24s)]
*  When Halle came, I think she had just turned 50 or 51. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3885.4799999999996s)]
*  I don't want to mis-say it, but she's in amazing shape. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3890.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3894.2799999999997s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3895.2799999999997s)]
*  I can't even tell you. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3896.2799999999997s)]
*  To see her in person. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3897.2799999999997s)]
*  She looks 35. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3898.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3899.2799999999997s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3900.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, literally. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3901.32s)]
*  Well, she's so fit. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3902.32s)]
*  I mean, that's the key. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3903.32s)]
*  Like, never stop. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3905.32s)]
*  This is one of the first couple weeks she ever did anything with us. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3906.32s)]
*  Like, she hadn't been doing anything at this point. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3909.76s)]
*  It's so choreographed, right? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3912.0400000000004s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3914.44s)]
*  Scissor takedowns. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3915.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3916.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3917.44s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3918.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3919.44s)]
*  And she trained down at Terrence, too. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3920.44s)]
*  I saw videos of her there. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3921.44s)]
*  Yeah, she's so game. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3922.44s)]
*  She's like one of those, you know, she's like Keanu. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3923.44s)]
*  They think on the deal. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3927.4s)]
*  Like, some people turn off to memorize the choreography. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3928.8s)]
*  They learn it so much that they can throw it away. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3931.8s)]
*  It's like learning your lines, right? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3933.48s)]
*  They learn their lines so, so much. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3934.48s)]
*  They can just flow. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3936.0800000000004s)]
*  They spend so much time doing that because they know they want to add in their little [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3937.4s)]
*  details and stuff. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3939.8s)]
*  They make it theirs. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3940.88s)]
*  It's pretty impressive to watch. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3941.88s)]
*  You almost feel lazy next to them. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3943.84s)]
*  Like, God, I need to work harder. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3945.0800000000004s)]
*  But it's cool. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3947.96s)]
*  When the crew sees it, you know, everybody, you can always tell when you're on a good [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3948.96s)]
*  movie if people don't give a shit. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3952.4s)]
*  And then the crew kind of doesn't give a shit. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3954.04s)]
*  But when you see the cast, it starts with Keanu. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3955.4s)]
*  And then you got this guy, never leaves set. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3958.0s)]
*  Then you got him and Halle and neither one want to leave set. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3959.0s)]
*  They don't want to miss a beat. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3961.12s)]
*  They don't want to miss a chance. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3962.12s)]
*  And then you got the rest of the cast and the rest of the crew. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3963.12s)]
*  And the crew is like, oh, we got to, it's just this constant inspiration thing. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3964.76s)]
*  And it's really, it's pretty fun. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3968.8s)]
*  It's pretty cool. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3971.44s)]
*  Now there's, aren't you guys doing some sort of a television show? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3972.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's coming out. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3976.12s)]
*  It was on, what was it? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3980.32s)]
*  I think it's on Amazon now, whatever, called The Continental. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3983.36s)]
*  It's kind of a spin-off that was done very separate from the world that we've created [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3986.8s)]
*  in the future world. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3991.8s)]
*  It's something that the studio had done a little on the side of us as we were going [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3992.84s)]
*  just to see what they could do with this Continental series. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=3997.76s)]
*  It's kind of interesting. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4000.2400000000002s)]
*  It's out. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4001.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not out yet. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4002.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it comes out. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4003.2400000000002s)]
*  This is it? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4004.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, end of the summer, I think. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4005.2400000000002s)]
*  But there's not a John Wick. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4007.88s)]
*  There's real no tie-in to the John Wick films. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4008.88s)]
*  But it does have a, it has the Continental in it. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4013.96s)]
*  It's kind of like Ian McShane's backstory a little bit and how he got there. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4016.48s)]
*  A little disjointed from the feature stuff, but it's got just another, I don't know, it's [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4021.56s)]
*  kind of a cool world they built like that. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4026.88s)]
*  It was very on the side of us. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4028.36s)]
*  And then hopefully we'll be seeing another TV show that's really about the John Wick [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4030.16s)]
*  features. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4033.32s)]
*  The bar at The Continental, the secret assassin's bar, the door at the bar. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4034.32s)]
*  I made a door like that for my comedy club. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4040.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could open up the thing to see who's coming through. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4042.92s)]
*  Literally, it's the same door. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4045.56s)]
*  When people go, what the fuck is this door for the green room of the comedy club? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4046.56s)]
*  And they go, that's the door from The Continental. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4050.28s)]
*  Ours opens like a hinge, but yeah, it's the same sort of deal. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4054.36s)]
*  That's pretty awesome. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4058.28s)]
*  It's pretty dope. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4059.28s)]
*  We've inspired the comedy green room. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4060.28s)]
*  Yeah, like when people see it, they go, what the fuck is up with this door? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4061.28s)]
*  Like, what are you expecting? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4064.08s)]
*  I'm like, no, no, no. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4065.08s)]
*  It's like this fucking real heavy steel door. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4066.08s)]
*  There's something cool about that, right? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4069.6800000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's real cool until someone gets their finger slammed in it. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4070.6800000000003s)]
*  Nothing says secret world like a thumb and finger. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4073.84s)]
*  But it is kind of like a secret world deal. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4076.04s)]
*  Like you have to punch the code in to get into the door or you have a key fob. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4077.72s)]
*  That's kind of like subcultures have always interested me. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4082.24s)]
*  There's always sub Rosa, right? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4084.72s)]
*  The sub Rosa world of the inside, whether it's comedians or stunt guys or cops or military, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4087.04s)]
*  there's always that in, that in click. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4092.68s)]
*  And I think that's what fascinates a lot of people a lot of times because they want to [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4094.92s)]
*  be part of that little. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4097.68s)]
*  We're usually going to name, some people give me shit because we called number three [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4098.68s)]
*  parable and then number four was like just done with four. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4103.36s)]
*  Yeah, we actually had a title for John Wick for it was called Haga Curry, Japanese word [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4106.4s)]
*  that really meant like hidden leaves. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4111.08s)]
*  It was a treatise on samurai code of ethics. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4112.92s)]
*  And it really spoke to it was kind of like the art of the way of dying. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4115.92s)]
*  Like how do you prepare yourself for a good death? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4120.839999999999s)]
*  And a lot of it dealt with you can only relate to people. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4123.16s)]
*  A warrior can only relate to a warrior, you know, whether you're on other sides or not. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4126.96s)]
*  A cop can only relate to a cop. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4130.5199999999995s)]
*  And like, you know, whatever a teacher can only relate to a teacher inside sub rows, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4131.96s)]
*  a thing that only each other knew each other and a thing. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4135.12s)]
*  We got it, but we didn't want to put it, you know, a title on it. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4138.24s)]
*  We kind of lost it. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4142.08s)]
*  But I thought it was a really cool thing about being sub rows or being in the inside. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4143.08s)]
*  Yeah, maybe on the next one. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4146.08s)]
*  Why did you decide this? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4149.12s)]
*  It was like, you know, it was the actual treatise. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4150.56s)]
*  It was from like 1646 or something like that. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4154.52s)]
*  Unfortunately, it had been used during World War II as a rallying cry for militaristic [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4157.8s)]
*  Japan to get behind. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4165.320000000001s)]
*  So in some Asian markets, it could be considered to be a problem. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4166.84s)]
*  We didn't want to take a chance. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4172.96s)]
*  It was yeah, Korea, Japan, Korea. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4173.96s)]
*  And we're like, OK, I get it. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4175.96s)]
*  We don't want to be sensitive to that. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4177.76s)]
*  But we still thought it was a cool name. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4179.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4181.4400000000005s)]
*  It's a weird world it is to make films and then have them be distributed worldwide. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4182.599999999999s)]
*  It's because, you know, it's like I'm sure, you know, you're always going to piss off [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4189.719999999999s)]
*  somebody. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4193.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're always going to get something or somebody can be something. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4194.36s)]
*  So you just again, I like doing the fantasy film kind of thing. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4197.04s)]
*  I like creating our own worlds. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4201.4s)]
*  I like doing that because it's ours and it's not taking a side. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4202.839999999999s)]
*  It's not really I don't have to adhere to history. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4205.599999999999s)]
*  I have to adhere to an IP and kind of just do our thing. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4208.44s)]
*  I think that kind of freedom helps a lot. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4211.44s)]
*  You know, I don't think people get I know, is bent out of shape sometimes on that because [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4214.839999999999s)]
*  you're creating your own world. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4218.759999999999s)]
*  Do you feel like there's a there's room for another thing like this in your life? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4220.5199999999995s)]
*  Like is this something you're going to try to do again, like recreate an entire ecosystem, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4227.2s)]
*  an entire world? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4232.679999999999s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4235.28s)]
*  Again, like we like we say, it was unintentional, completely unintentional, almost a fluke. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4237.12s)]
*  We did one that we did. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4242.8s)]
*  We didn't know. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4244.4s)]
*  I didn't know anything about the continentals worldwide or the markers or anything until [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4245.4s)]
*  the second one made that up. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4248.24s)]
*  And the third one, like, oh, let's call it the high table. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4249.24s)]
*  Sure. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4251.8s)]
*  Someone will buy that. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4252.8s)]
*  Sure. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4253.8s)]
*  And we just keep, you know, kind of riffing on stuff to do and just use your imagination. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4254.8s)]
*  But it works. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4258.16s)]
*  It does. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4259.16s)]
*  And I think again, it works that it's a continental to that it's international, like when he goes [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4260.16s)]
*  to Italy and he goes and gets suited. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4265.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4267.68s)]
*  Well, that that was probably one of my favorite things. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4268.68s)]
*  I love the suit. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4270.24s)]
*  I love that actor, whoever that actor was that is explaining to him the guns and oh, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4271.24s)]
*  what is it? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4277.64s)]
*  Peter Seranoff. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4278.64s)]
*  It's yeah, yeah. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4279.64s)]
*  He was in a couple. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4280.64s)]
*  He was in the suits and the guns. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4281.64s)]
*  This whole scene, that guy right there, the ball guy right there. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4282.64s)]
*  That's Luca Mosca. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4289.22s)]
*  That's actually my wardrobe supervisor. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4290.22s)]
*  I couldn't cast somebody in time, so I made him do it. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4291.22s)]
*  And Peter's fun of it. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4293.24s)]
*  This guy's fucking funny. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4294.96s)]
*  He's so fucking funny. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4295.96s)]
*  Yeah, you just buy him as a complete psycho. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4296.96s)]
*  He literally flew in on the day, learned the lines, did the gig and flew out. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4300.8s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4304.96s)]
*  Yeah, he was awesome. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4305.96s)]
*  Well, he's incredible. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4306.96s)]

*  or we were just trying to do the one up thing. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4407.32s)]
*  Like now we're all in. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4409.16s)]
*  We're going all out. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4410.16s)]
*  You know, you can't always have those talks. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4411.16s)]

*  Let's just go. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4416.28s)]
*  We'll just keep going. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4417.28s)]
*  Cause why fall down? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4418.28s)]
*  You know, we're a lot of my influences are all from Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd and [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4419.28s)]
*  a lot of silent movie stuff. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4423.44s)]
*  And Buster made, oh, you go back and watch the movies now and go back like the documentary [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4424.84s)]
*  on Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4430.28s)]
*  How did Buster Keaton do all that stuff? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4432.2s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4434.599999999999s)]
*  Cause we've watched some of those clips and it's like, how are you doing? [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4435.599999999999s)]
*  Cause there's no special effects like that. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4438.48s)]
*  I have been a part of so many great stunt teams and work with so many stunt rigors and [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4440.16s)]
*  visual effects people. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4444.48s)]
*  There are still gags that he is back then that we're all kind of like, yeah, it's a [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4446.839999999999s)]
*  bit sketch, man. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4449.879999999999s)]
*  I like how I don't think you do a lot of what he do even do nowadays. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4450.879999999999s)]
*  Cause like, look, this is stuff. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4455.44s)]
*  I mean, they're, they're cranking the footage a little bit, but like that's him falling [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4457.48s)]
*  off a motorcycle. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4460.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4461.24s)]
*  Like he still don't think these are all great gags. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4462.24s)]
*  And like, if you miss, there's a penalty. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4464.2s)]
*  Well, how about the one when he grabs ahold the back of a train? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4465.5199999999995s)]
*  The trolley. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4469.32s)]
*  Like, look at this right here. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4470.32s)]
*  This is like, yeah, this is going probably a little bit slower. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4471.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4474.4s)]
*  But you know what happens if you miss? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4475.4s)]
*  You're dead. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4476.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4477.4s)]
*  There's no out. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4478.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4479.4s)]
*  And when he's like, watch this, watch the shit he's doing here. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4480.4s)]
*  Like, how's he even doing that? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4482.96s)]
*  This is early wire work that you can't even tell. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4485.08s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4488.44s)]
*  But like every time he falls and does this stuff, those are real fall. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4489.44s)]
*  Like he's buried a man in the dirt there, but he's still taking the hit. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4493.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big hit too. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4497.28s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4498.599999999999s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4499.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, watch this. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4500.599999999999s)]
*  Watch this shit. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4501.599999999999s)]
*  He's going to grab the dummy as it comes over the waterfall. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4502.599999999999s)]
*  Like he's still got to do it. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4506.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4508.36s)]
*  You know, like we'd be doing it with green screen, double safeties. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4510.679999999999s)]
*  We'd have wires on and we'd have a backup in there. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4513.12s)]
*  The stunt guy would do it a couple of times. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4514.92s)]
*  And like, you know, that's not tech 12 rope there. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4517.2s)]
*  That's a woman. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4519.36s)]
*  That's not even a dummy. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4520.36s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4521.36s)]

*  Like, look at that. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4527.48s)]
*  I mean, the penalty for that miss is you're dead. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4528.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4530.5199999999995s)]

*  No. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4533.12s)]
*  I mean, that's probably one of his most famous gags that Jackie's repeated in a few other [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4534.12s)]
*  things. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4537.96s)]

*  I mean, the one when he grabs the train and you see him go sideways, like he's holding [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4557.2s)]
*  onto the train and it's. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4561.639999999999s)]

*  How about your grip? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4576.84s)]
*  I mean, I just. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4577.84s)]
*  This is one. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4579.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4580.599999999999s)]
*  Watch this thing. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4581.599999999999s)]
*  Like, how how does he do this? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4582.599999999999s)]
*  That's a he's got a wire coming out of his belt. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4585.8s)]
*  You can see it right there. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4588.92s)]
*  He's probably got an arbor up top there. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4589.92s)]
*  But like, you know, this is the one where I think he they said he broke his neck on [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4591.64s)]
*  this one. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4595.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4596.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4597.28s)]
*  He got injured on this one. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4598.28s)]
*  Back then when you broke your neck. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4600.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4601.72s)]
*  You wasn't a lot of help. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4602.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4603.72s)]
*  You weren't exactly know what the fuck the doctors did for you. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4604.72s)]
*  But like this year. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4607.56s)]
*  Like, oh, boom. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4609.36s)]
*  That's a railroad track. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4611.56s)]
*  There's no pads down there. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4614.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, look, and he got up. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4615.679999999999s)]
*  Look at this guy. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4616.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4617.679999999999s)]
*  That guy. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4618.679999999999s)]
*  And how many movies did he do like that? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4619.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4621.679999999999s)]
*  He had a ton. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4622.679999999999s)]
*  He had over like 100 productions by the time he was done. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4623.679999999999s)]
*  You know, and Harold Lloyd was no slump either. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4625.679999999999s)]
*  Charlie Chaplin, all those guys. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4627.08s)]
*  He had to fall. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4628.08s)]
*  All of them. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4629.08s)]
*  There's no there's no trickery to it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4630.08s)]
*  They just, you know, they gave you the setup. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4632.08s)]
*  But like, that's pretty over the top, too. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4634.08s)]
*  So we're like, OK, so when we send that guy down the stairs and number four, we're like, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4636.48s)]
*  yeah, I can't stand double this guy. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4640.48s)]
*  Vincent from France. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4642.48s)]
*  Amazing, like just muscles where you shouldn't have muscles. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4643.5599999999995s)]
*  And, you know, we scouted Sacre-CÅur and we're like, you know, there's over 400 steps [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4646.5599999999995s)]
*  in the portion we're using is like 222. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4651.36s)]
*  We're like, yeah, we got to send somebody down this. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4653.36s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4656.36s)]
*  We're going to make Keanu Clough. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4657.36s)]
*  Then we'll send him down. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4658.36s)]
*  And then, you know what? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4659.36s)]
*  We'll send him down again. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4660.36s)]
*  So we had Vincent come out and look at it. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4661.36s)]
*  And Vincent's English is limited. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4664.36s)]
*  You know, he's just very French. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4666.36s)]
*  And he looked down and said, Vincent, you cool. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4667.36s)]
*  Like, you know, one take you're going to. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4669.36s)]
*  We just lit up a cigarette and said, sure, when do we go? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4671.44s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4674.44s)]
*  He did this first take. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4675.44s)]
*  He went down only about 10 steps and got stuck in the railing. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4676.44s)]
*  Second take is the take that's in the movie where it just went all the way down, like 200 steps. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4678.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is crazy that this guy did this. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4682.44s)]
*  What kind of padding is he wearing? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4685.44s)]
*  He's just wearing like, you know, the regular Kevlar padding that the stunt guys use. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4687.44s)]
*  He's getting some fucking air, too. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4690.44s)]
*  Vincent's not shy. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4692.44s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4693.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's great. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4695.44s)]
*  And Keanu doing the overlap. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4697.44s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4698.44s)]
*  Yeah, we have a stair fetish, too. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4699.5199999999995s)]
*  Love throwing guys. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4701.5199999999995s)]
*  It's car hits and stairs. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4702.5199999999995s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4703.5199999999995s)]
*  You get Tom Cruise hanging off the airplane. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4704.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's awesome. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4706.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4707.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's amazing. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4708.5199999999995s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4709.5199999999995s)]
*  I know what it takes to do that. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4710.5199999999995s)]
*  But a lot of people can't relate to just, you know, hang off an airplane. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4711.5199999999995s)]
*  They've never done it. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4713.5199999999995s)]
*  But everybody's falling on ice. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4714.5199999999995s)]
*  Everyone's falling down stairs. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4715.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4716.5199999999995s)]
*  Everyone gets the car thing. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4717.5199999999995s)]
*  So we focused a lot on body falls and, you know, falling down stairs. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4718.5199999999995s)]
*  Shit that makes people go, oh, that could really hurt. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4721.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  Especially being hit by a car. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4725.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, I love car hits. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4726.5199999999995s)]
*  Love watching that. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4728.6s)]
*  Yeah, he gets hit by a bunch of cars. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4729.6s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4730.6s)]
*  When you see the stunt guys actually get hit by the cars, you're like... [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4731.6s)]
*  In two, like in the scene when he's retrieving his car. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4733.6s)]
*  And, you know, he... [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4737.6s)]
*  Oh, he's wha... [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4738.6s)]
*  He whaps this one stunt guy, Efka. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4739.6s)]
*  He whaps him with the reverse 180. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4741.6s)]
*  He really sent him. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4742.6s)]
*  It was a good hit. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4743.6s)]
*  Really? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4744.6s)]
*  It was like 20 feet away, Washington, going, oh, that was a great hit. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4745.6s)]
*  How did you do when he hits the pole? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4748.6s)]
*  We had a little bit of a wire on him. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4750.6s)]
*  So the car hits him and sends him. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4752.6s)]
*  The wire doesn't really pull him. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4754.6s)]
*  When he hits the pole high, the wire helps the landing. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4756.68s)]
*  So we decelerate him a little bit. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4758.68s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4760.68s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4761.68s)]
*  It still sucks. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4762.68s)]
*  Is he actually hitting the pole? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4763.68s)]
*  Yeah, it still sucks. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4764.68s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4765.68s)]
*  Absolutely still sucks. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4766.68s)]
*  But like the downside, just in case he gets knocked out, we don't want to land on his [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4767.68s)]
*  head. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4770.68s)]
*  So... [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4771.68s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4772.68s)]
*  Yeah, Efka right here. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4773.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4774.68s)]
*  Boom, bang. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4775.68s)]
*  I mean, how the fuck? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4776.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4779.68s)]
*  Again, we're super fortunate. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4781.68s)]
*  We get some of the best stunt guys. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4783.76s)]
*  And most movies prep for like six to ten weeks. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4785.76s)]
*  We'll prep for five months with our core stunt team. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4788.76s)]
*  So the guys are really trying to design stuff. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4791.76s)]
*  And other than some bumps and bruises, no one's ever really been tweaked. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4793.76s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4798.76s)]
*  So that's, again, just having the right people. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4799.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4802.76s)]
*  Well, I guess that helps that you have this long background of stunt work. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4803.76s)]
*  I think it helps knowing, one, who to call. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4807.76s)]
*  And I think you get that sense of how far you can push. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4811.84s)]
*  And again, I'm not against CGI. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4814.84s)]
*  I'm not against digital help. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4816.84s)]
*  We do so many digital stitches and hide things. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4817.84s)]
*  Like, I think it's all great. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4819.84s)]
*  It's just what gives you that energy or that feeling of what's going on. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4820.84s)]
*  If I could do it all digitally and get the feeling and not hurt anybody, yes, that's [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4825.84s)]
*  an option. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4829.84s)]
*  But there's something to still real world physical effects that make you, you know, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4830.84s)]
*  still crunch. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4834.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's something about CGI. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4835.84s)]
*  And that's the big, I had Rick Baker on and we were talking about monster movies where [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4837.92s)]
*  they use CGI versus monster movies where they use like his type of special effects. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4843.92s)]
*  Well, The Thing is still one of the best. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4848.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4850.92s)]
*  You watch The Thing or American, I know, American World from London. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4851.92s)]
*  One of my favorite all time films. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4853.92s)]
*  It's one of the greatest movies ever. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4854.92s)]
*  Ever. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4855.92s)]
*  Ever. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4856.92s)]
*  And it hits you in all the right ways. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4857.92s)]
*  It's so subtle. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4858.92s)]
*  It's almost like an old Hammer film with Christopher Plummer, Christopher Lee. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4859.92s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4862.92s)]
*  If you watch, it's got that weird kind of in the Moors, you know, old school fog machines [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4864.0s)]
*  when they're in the thing. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4868.52s)]
*  Well, John Landis did such a good job with that movie too because he made it funny. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4869.52s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4872.6s)]
*  Look at the tone of that movie. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4873.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4874.6s)]
*  It's so different. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4875.6s)]
*  It's not quite action. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4876.6s)]
*  It's not quite thrill. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4877.6s)]
*  It's not quite horror, but it's that little nexus of that weird almost cheesy, but he [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4878.6s)]
*  rides the line, but then it's still fucking scary. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4883.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4885.32s)]
*  And it's got the best transition into a werewolf. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4886.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4887.72s)]
*  Ever. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4888.72s)]
*  And I mean, what would you call them? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4889.72s)]
*  Werewolf Nazis? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4890.72s)]
*  Yeah, those monster Nazis. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4891.72s)]
*  It's such a good movie. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4894.52s)]
*  But I would agree, man. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4896.64s)]
*  There's something about, you know, they put the KY jelly on the creature suit and it comes [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4897.64s)]
*  out and there's something about that. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4902.280000000001s)]
*  But I think the really way to do it, if you could blend it, you know, if you could blend [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4903.9800000000005s)]
*  that great prosthetic effect with the CG motion and somehow really put those two together, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4908.400000000001s)]
*  it's just most people nowadays, they choose. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4913.280000000001s)]
*  Like, half of what we're doing are blends. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4915.6s)]
*  Like it's a practical stunt done in a digital composition. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4917.92s)]
*  Like I'm layering in things. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4921.360000000001s)]
*  The shotgun stuff. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4924.2s)]
*  The guys are on fire, but I'm putting the shotgun stuff and they're all different layers [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4925.2s)]
*  that I've stitched together and all the guys are doing it. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4927.42s)]
*  So I don't have to worry about, you know, putting guys out because they're still on [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4929.84s)]
*  fire. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4932.78s)]
*  So we're doing like a Texas switch. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4933.78s)]
*  We see one stunt guy on fire run in and another stunt guy, he goes out, he gets put out and [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4934.96s)]
*  the other guy comes in. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4938.9s)]
*  So what was the inspiration for this? [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4940.58s)]
*  What was this shotgun supposed to be loaded with that lights people on fire? [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4942.64s)]
*  It's actually called Dragon's Breath. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4946.52s)]
*  You can check it out. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4947.78s)]
*  It's real? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4948.78s)]
*  It's real. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4949.78s)]
*  Dragon's Breath is real. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4950.78s)]
*  No shit. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4951.78s)]
*  There's this great YouTube video with this Russian guy. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4953.099999999999s)]
*  If you type in Dragon's Breath, he's got a red, white and blue shotgun. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4956.38s)]
*  He's this crazy Russian guy that does it and it's fucking, that guy, second one down. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4959.58s)]
*  That's the first video I saw of it with this crazy Russian guy. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4966.0199999999995s)]
*  He shoots like a spear gun out of his 12 gauge. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4971.099999999999s)]
*  He does all this stuff. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4973.099999999999s)]
*  He's doing all these wacky rounds. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4974.099999999999s)]
*  Like you know, these little needles that come out and then spear and then he does Dragon's [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4976.7s)]
*  Breath. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4980.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4981.5s)]
*  So it really does light people on fire. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4983.22s)]
*  That is fucking crazy. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4985.26s)]
*  They're like the big balls, right? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4987.26s)]
*  They're covered in phosphorus. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4988.74s)]
*  So when they hit the air, they ignite. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4989.74s)]
*  So they're putting holes in you and they're lighting you on fire at the same time. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4992.02s)]
*  Where do I buy them? [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4995.22s)]
*  See? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4997.22s)]
*  I saw that early in prep. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4998.22s)]
*  I was just fucking bored out of my mind. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=4999.22s)]
*  I was surfing through the internet. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5000.9s)]
*  I was going like, I was looking up, we already did the Benelli thing. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5001.9s)]
*  We did the caddy, his quad loading. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5005.46s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know if I want to do shotguns again, but I'm like, look, it's the third [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5007.46s)]
*  act. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5011.02s)]
*  I have the Arctic Triumph sequence in my head. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5012.540000000001s)]
*  I know I'm going to do the stairs. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5014.02s)]
*  And then Taron introduced me to the Genesis shotgun, automatic shotgun. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5015.02s)]
*  That thing is insane. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5020.780000000001s)]
*  I shot that at his place. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5021.780000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5023.740000000001s)]
*  Isn't it like 12 rounds? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5024.740000000001s)]
*  How many rounds is it? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5025.740000000001s)]
*  I think it's more than 12. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5026.740000000001s)]
*  Is it 20? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5027.740000000001s)]
*  It might be. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5028.740000000001s)]
*  It was a giant banana club. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5029.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5030.740000000001s)]
*  I thought it was almost like 14 or 15. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5031.740000000001s)]
*  It's something like that, right? [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5032.740000000001s)]
*  But like, and it's boom, it's like very aggressive. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5033.740000000001s)]
*  It's like on an AR platform, but it's a shotgun. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5035.740000000001s)]
*  So he had already introduced me to that. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5038.46s)]
*  And I was out in Berlin going, I don't, you know, how am I going to do it? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5040.9s)]
*  To regular people, it looks the same. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5044.06s)]
*  It's not a stylistic change. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5046.02s)]
*  It looks like, again, like an AR or a 308 or something. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5047.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5050.42s)]
*  So it wasn't going to be a shocking change if he grabbed it from the guy. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5051.42s)]
*  So I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do this. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5054.7s)]
*  And then I saw that video. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5057.14s)]
*  I'm like, oh. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5058.14s)]
*  That's it. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5059.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5060.14s)]
*  Like, oh. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5061.14s)]
*  But then I couldn't figure out like, because it's just that starburst. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5062.14s)]
*  And like, like you, like no one, they're going to call bullshit on me. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5065.26s)]
*  That doesn't exist. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5068.58s)]
*  So I thought in the montage, I'll have these guys pull out the Dragon's Wrath. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5070.02s)]
*  And then I saw this, you know, I have this huge video game, like a cinematic trailer [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5073.38s)]
*  collection. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5079.06s)]
*  And I was just scrolling through it and this game, something I had, I saw like years ago [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5080.06s)]
*  was called Hong Kong Massacre. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5084.38s)]
*  You have Hong Kong Massacre trailer. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5085.780000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what was cool about it was from the top, like we use top shots a lot [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5088.3s)]
*  in film and action, but it always looks like, like if I did a top shot here, she's looking [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5091.9400000000005s)]
*  at the carpet and be the top of our heads doing fight stuff. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5095.1s)]
*  So it's OK. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5098.139999999999s)]
*  But like, I wanted a way to make it color and poppy. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5099.139999999999s)]
*  So I saw this in the blood on the white floors and the paper and all. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5101.179999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5103.9s)]
*  Right. But this is some wacky I had never heard of, but I'd saw the trailer. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5105.3s)]
*  It's fucking cool. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5108.139999999999s)]
*  This is a video game? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5109.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5110.58s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5111.099999999999s)]
*  Well, we're getting so close with A.I. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5112.98s)]
*  and CGI and the ability to recreate scenes that aren't real. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5115.66s)]
*  Right. Like. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5120.099999999999s)]
*  Are you worried that there's going to come a time where you're not going to need to [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5123.139999999999s)]
*  film movies anymore? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5126.46s)]
*  I don't. Yeah. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5129.26s)]
*  Well, you know, that's part of the thing with the writer's strike right now. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5132.1s)]
*  A part of it. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5134.42s)]
*  A part of the negotiations is A.I. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5135.42s)]
*  and they're trying to prepare for that. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5136.9400000000005s)]
*  Merging technology that's going to replace. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5140.26s)]
*  That's what's interesting. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5142.18s)]
*  Like, you know, people think that, you know, the writer's strike is about something. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5143.02s)]
*  But that and there's pay raises. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5145.86s)]
*  There's there's a lot of issues to what the WGA is doing right now. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5147.58s)]
*  But I think the writers are addressing something that people dismiss too easily, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5151.42s)]
*  which is the A.I. influence. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5155.54s)]
*  Like somebody's got to be the first one to bring this up. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5156.9s)]
*  Like, you know, you'll have some people might might critique [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5159.26s)]
*  going, well, why are we talking about A.I.? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5162.62s)]
*  Like, they're not going to write. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5164.1s)]
*  But yeah, they it can. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5164.86s)]
*  I think the writers are doing the absolute right thing right now [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5167.0199999999995s)]
*  by bringing this up, by introducing this, because it it's at that point where [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5169.86s)]
*  A.I. is doing the art already. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5176.26s)]
*  You know, if you can pipe in, right? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5178.1s)]
*  You don't have to pay a license fee. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5179.06s)]
*  They're freaking out. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5180.1s)]
*  Yeah, and they should. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5181.06s)]
*  I mean, we we've seen what it can do. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5181.9s)]
*  It's impressive. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5183.66s)]
*  But you do have to feed it from somewhere. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5184.98s)]
*  It's not quite going to take over the world yet. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5186.299999999999s)]
*  Well, this is artists. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5188.219999999999s)]
*  Her name is Molly Crabapple, and she she's been speaking out about this. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5189.259999999999s)]
*  And she's got a very good point. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5193.299999999999s)]
*  It's they're not really making these. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5194.98s)]
*  They're kind of stealing them from online. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5198.54s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5200.86s)]
*  That's what the writers are about, because the scripts have to come from somewhere. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5202.099999999999s)]
*  Right. I have to input something. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5204.78s)]
*  Well, at least with writing, you're kind of inputting from language, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5206.78s)]
*  human language that has existed forever. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5211.58s)]
*  But with illustrations, they're taking illustrations like you. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5214.58s)]
*  You aware of the the artist Alex Gray? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5218.860000000001s)]
*  Alex Gray is a famous visionary artist. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5222.58s)]
*  There's a lot of this wild psychedelic stuff. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5225.740000000001s)]
*  You can ask A.I. to make like pull up the ones that I have on my Instagram. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5228.54s)]
*  There's they they did these images in the style of Alex Gray. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5234.46s)]
*  And they're as good as Alex Gray's stuff. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5239.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, but it's stealing. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5242.099999999999s)]
*  But they had to from his style. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5244.58s)]
*  It's his style. He created this like all that. Right. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5246.219999999999s)]
*  Like that is all A.I. generated. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5249.419999999999s)]
*  And it's fucking fantastic. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5251.219999999999s)]
*  And some people like, I don't like it. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5253.98s)]
*  Well, I do. Yeah, I like it because I like to look at it. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5255.9s)]
*  But I would rather it be something that Alex Gray actually made. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5259.139999999999s)]
*  But if you look at that, that art is incredible. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5262.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's undeniably incredible. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5265.219999999999s)]
*  And it's all psychedelic inspired. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5267.459999999999s)]
*  And like, look at that. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5269.66s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5270.78s)]
*  That's A.I. made that. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5272.42s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck, man? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5274.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. That's a can is really big on that, too. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5275.58s)]
*  We're all worried about not where I guess we're concerned about what [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5278.42s)]
*  what the not just the licensing. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5282.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not worried about being out of a job yet. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5283.7s)]
*  I don't think I think we're still a ways off from that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5286.58s)]
*  As far as live action film goes, as far as animes [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5289.259999999999s)]
*  or video game cinematics and stuff, I think that's that's on the horizon. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5292.9s)]
*  Yes, I really think that's coming. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5296.7s)]
*  If you're doing trailers or if you're doing short films, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5298.42s)]
*  especially with computer generated animation, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5301.22s)]
*  you think that's a legitimate concern. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5303.62s)]
*  As far as the overall creative, I don't I agree with you. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5306.34s)]
*  I think it's a concerning thing. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5309.82s)]
*  But like, how do you control technology? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5311.02s)]
*  You can't say don't do it. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5313.34s)]
*  So it's just going to get better. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5314.46s)]
*  I think unfortunately, what my thought is that one day [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5316.06s)]
*  it's going to get to the point where people have to cherish things [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5320.42s)]
*  that are actually made by humans. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5323.78s)]
*  Like this table's made by a person. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5325.3s)]
*  Handmade, handmade by a person. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5327.3s)]
*  And it's not going to be everybody that cares. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5330.14s)]
*  There's going to be some people that are on your phone. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5333.14s)]
*  I mean, I made table. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5334.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they want. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5336.26s)]
*  Look, I want to I want a human written song. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5336.9800000000005s)]
*  I want human composed music. Yeah. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5339.14s)]
*  You know, but I think the licensing part of it is like until I mean, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5341.54s)]
*  as far as I know, they still have to input like you're saying, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5345.820000000001s)]
*  James or John Gray, they have to like him. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5348.42s)]
*  They don't have a word for it. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5350.820000000001s)]
*  So they have to import and literally steal his. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5351.820000000001s)]
*  Alex. Yeah. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5354.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you have to steal his images and then use [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5355.74s)]
*  a eye to make something in the style of him. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5359.46s)]
*  But as far as like illustrators for like the cover of books and things [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5362.139999999999s)]
*  along those lines, I think that's very viable. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5366.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're fucked. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5368.7s)]
*  Performance still, I think, is because even now with what they can do [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5369.54s)]
*  with amateur, they still need performers to go and give you that little twist. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5372.82s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, directors come in and kind of create, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5375.54s)]
*  you know, like the animations like we you're still using a model [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5379.099999999999s)]
*  that you've seen in your head to try and get that computer generated character. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5381.86s)]
*  But I think the real genius of film sometimes is the unknown, right? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5385.9s)]
*  The happy accident, as Orson Welles would say. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5390.98s)]
*  You'll get Keanu or Brad Pitt or you'll get these wonderful actors up there. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5393.179999999999s)]
*  And you'll get like I just watched Heat last night. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5396.94s)]
*  Oh, amazing. Like you can't tell me man had all that. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5398.82s)]
*  And like those are just great people on screen. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5402.46s)]
*  And they're just you can't help. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5404.38s)]
*  You know, it's a great ass. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5406.26s)]
*  Like, you know, that wasn't scripted. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5407.62s)]
*  That's how I like. Yeah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5409.179999999999s)]
*  There's still those moments that I think. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5410.54s)]
*  How about Al Pacino having a kid at 82? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5412.62s)]
*  Very fucking psycho or stud. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5415.62s)]
*  I guess. But I mean, yeah. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5419.219999999999s)]
*  Where is he going to be when that kid's 20 or five? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5420.82s)]
*  Yeah. You know, or five. Yeah. Right. Right. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5423.82s)]
*  Because like, but like that's that's crazy, right? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5426.74s)]
*  It's great. That's pretty crazy. Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5429.66s)]
*  He's 82 years old and still shooting live rounds. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5431.98s)]
*  What the fuck? Or it's a great cover story. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5436.66s)]
*  I don't think it is. Yeah. But that's that's impressive. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5438.9s)]
*  I mean, maybe he needs to get a DNA test done. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5441.9s)]
*  But I bet he did demand one. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5443.74s)]
*  Did he demand one? Oh, boy. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5446.74s)]
*  That's a tense moment. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5449.219999999999s)]
*  I thought he could no longer have children. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5450.3s)]
*  That's a boy. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5451.86s)]
*  It turns out he is the father. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5453.5s)]
*  That's a tense moment. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5455.66s)]
*  That's an uncomfortable conversation. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5456.94s)]
*  I couldn't have kids. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5458.94s)]
*  You wonder if he was like that. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5461.38s)]
*  He had to. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5463.74s)]
*  I mean, to say I don't trust you. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5464.86s)]
*  I want a DNA test done. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5467.82s)]
*  That flavors the entire rest of the. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5469.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's not going to go well after that. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5471.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's always going to be the mommy, daddy talk. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5473.86s)]
*  You might not make it to the kid being five because of her. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5476.94s)]
*  She might have a heavy pillow for him. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5480.86s)]
*  I was going to say, have another cup of tea, darling. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5482.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5485.0599999999995s)]

*  Yeah. It's a that's a tense moment. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5489.38s)]
*  You're asking someone to take a DNA test and then you say, I'm sorry. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5492.34s)]
*  That's not enough trust out there anymore. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5496.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, that's probably going to be remedy, too. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5499.26s)]
*  I think mind reading is around the corner. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5502.5s)]
*  I think is that where we're headed? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5504.54s)]
*  I think we're about a decade away from no secrets. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5506.46s)]
*  None zero people being able to read people's thoughts. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5510.18s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I don't think I think [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5513.14s)]
*  the application of it will probably they'll start probably [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5516.0199999999995s)]
*  doing Neuralink and similar technologies. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5519.62s)]
*  They'll start doing human trials probably within. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5522.54s)]
*  I think they start doing it already. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5525.58s)]
*  But I mean, in terms of like the ability to get [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5527.26s)]
*  the other approved for human trials. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5531.06s)]
*  What kind of psycho do you have to be to be one of the early adopters? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5533.02s)]

*  Yeah. Whatever. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  Was all that crazy stuff in the 70s on MKUltra and all that. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5544.9800000000005s)]
*  They were always they're already trying to do all this shit. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5547.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, they were doing some wild shit in the 70s and the 60s. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5550.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's what the book Chaos by Tom O'Neill. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5553.42s)]
*  I talk about it too much and I'm sorry for everybody. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5556.78s)]
*  Well, I read it. I'd love to read it. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5558.54s)]
*  No, I haven't read it. It's about Manson. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5560.38s)]
*  It's about Manson and the CIA and MKUltra. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5562.46s)]
*  Yeah. MKUltra, this guy, Jolly West, he was also responsible [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5564.78s)]
*  for making Jack Ruby go crazy. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5568.7s)]
*  He visited Jack Ruby in jail and after he shot Lee Harvey Oswald [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5570.78s)]
*  and then Jack Ruby was like saying, they're burning the Jews. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5574.58s)]
*  He's like hiding under his bunk screaming like, I mean, hell. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5577.7s)]
*  Like he was they fucking dosed him with acid. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5581.219999999999s)]
*  Then they dosed Manson with acid. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5584.58s)]
*  And I think they taught Manson, I mean, according to Tom O'Neill's [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5586.1s)]
*  research, which I trust. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5589.38s)]
*  And it's an amazing book. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5591.18s)]
*  Tom O'Neill was a guy who was a neighbor for my friend Greg Fitzsimmons. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5593.14s)]
*  And he was like, hey, what are you working on? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5598.42s)]
*  He's like, I'm writing this article about Charles Manson [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5600.1s)]
*  and the anniversary of the Manson family murders. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5603.02s)]
*  He starts writing it 20 years ago and he starts doing research [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5606.5s)]
*  and he can't get the article out. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5611.42s)]
*  It's just too much research. He's doing too much. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5613.46s)]
*  And it extends fucking forever. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5615.38s)]
*  He keeps having to give money back. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5618.66s)]
*  And like the publishers are freaking out at him. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5620.34s)]
*  And then finally, they got him someone to help him and an editor [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5622.82s)]
*  to sit down with them. And he puts out this masterpiece. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5626.42s)]
*  And this book is called Chaos. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5629.38s)]
*  And it's the definitive book on Charles Manson, the Manson family [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5631.06s)]
*  and their ties to the CIA. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5636.54s)]
*  And it's fucking crazy. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5638.78s)]
*  It's crazy. They did it to discredit the hippie movement. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5640.9800000000005s)]
*  They had this guy and these flower children. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5643.94s)]
*  They had them go out and fucking murder people. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5646.98s)]
*  And they talked them into doing it with acid and they trained them [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5648.9s)]
*  how to do it through the techniques that he learned through MKUltra. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5651.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's like it's pretty pretty definitive. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5656.14s)]
*  I mean, when you read it, you're you know, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5659.22s)]
*  it doesn't leave a lot to imagination. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5661.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's like pretty much that's what they did. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5664.1s)]
*  And, you know, they were involved in all kinds of shit with that back then. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5667.7s)]
*  You know, that's the Stanford prison experiments. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5671.179999999999s)]
*  That's the Harvard LSD studies, the Harvard LSD studies. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5673.74s)]
*  When they did that, you know who was in that? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5677.419999999999s)]
*  The fucking Unabomber, the Unabomber. Yeah, Ted Kaczynski. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5680.74s)]
*  He was a part of the Harvard LSD studies. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5684.0599999999995s)]
*  He was already fucked up. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5686.5s)]
*  His brother said he was already fucked up because when he was young, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5688.0599999999995s)]
*  there's a great documentary on him that's on Netflix. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5690.339999999999s)]
*  It's really good. Right. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5693.259999999999s)]
*  And in it, they talk about how he was ill when he was a child. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5694.9s)]
*  He's a baby. And they put him in like this [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5698.18s)]
*  in, I guess, some sort of a hospital. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5702.38s)]
*  And in this hospital, they didn't pick him up. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5704.9800000000005s)]
*  They didn't take it. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5707.620000000001s)]
*  They just let him cry in a crib for like weeks and months. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5708.5s)]
*  And like he had no human touch. Jesus. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5712.18s)]
*  Yeah. So he became like this that I'll make him a fucking psychopath. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5714.9400000000005s)]
*  And then on top of that, they put him in the Harvard LSD studies. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5719.22s)]
*  So then they don't. And then he writes the manifesto [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5723.14s)]
*  and then starts fucking killing people because he thinks, [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5725.660000000001s)]
*  rightly so, that technology is going to replace human beings, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5728.26s)]
*  which I think is probably as crazy as he was. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5731.38s)]
*  He probably saw something. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5734.42s)]
*  I mean, if you extrapolate what's happening now with technology [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5736.54s)]
*  and you take it to to its logical end, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5740.3s)]
*  like what's the event horizon of technology? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5743.900000000001s)]
*  Well, it's an artificial life form. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5746.1s)]
*  It's probably what it's probably not just AI. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5748.22s)]
*  It's probably life itself. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5751.34s)]
*  It's not the artificial intelligence that exists in a computer. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5753.42s)]
*  It's probably a new form of life. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5755.66s)]
*  And I think that's probably what human beings give birth to. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5759.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that's what we're doing. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5762.78s)]
*  That's why we're obsessed with technology and innovation. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5763.9s)]
*  I think it's a part of the process that leads intelligent life forms [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5766.54s)]
*  to create intelligent life, which is evolution. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5769.98s)]
*  And that intelligent life creates vastly superior intelligent life [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5773.139999999999s)]
*  because it just knows how to do it better. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5777.46s)]
*  And it probably doesn't like almost instantly. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5779.46s)]
*  It's like, oh, you guys fucked up everything. Exactly. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5781.5s)]
*  It looks back and goes, OK, we don't need you anymore. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5783.38s)]
*  Yeah. Well, not only that, just all we'd have to do is just make [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5785.46s)]
*  all you have to do to get rid of people. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5789.9800000000005s)]
*  It's people like, oh, they're going to wipe us out. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5792.38s)]
*  All they have to do is give us free electricity, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5794.26s)]
*  free food, free Internet and an app that makes you come. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5797.3s)]
*  And that would be it. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5802.14s)]
*  That's it. We'd all that would be a wrap. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5803.46s)]
*  We'd all just stay in our homes. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5804.82s)]
*  Yeah. No one would go anywhere. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5805.82s)]
*  Let it fade out. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5807.14s)]
*  If you can come 300 times a day, good luck having a family. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5808.02s)]
*  Yeah. Good luck having relationships. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5810.78s)]
*  Good luck even forming them. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5812.26s)]
*  If you can have these these experiences [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5813.9s)]
*  through an app or through artificial intelligence, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5817.099999999999s)]
*  something that's attached to your brain that's infinitely superior. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5821.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, look how addicted people are to just looking at TikTok, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5824.82s)]
*  just looking at people do dances and get hit by cars. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5829.179999999999s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5832.58s)]
*  It's insane. And it's so addictive. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5833.94s)]
*  And it's very minor in the reward that it gives you. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5836.139999999999s)]
*  It gives you this very minor dopamine rush. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5839.42s)]
*  Right. But if it gives you [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5841.62s)]
*  transcendental experiences, unbelievable experiences. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5843.5s)]
*  Surreal to the point that they feel real. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5846.94s)]
*  Well, that's the worry about the simulation. Right. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5848.82s)]
*  That there's a lot of people, Elon included, that believe that [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5851.98s)]
*  it's more likely that we are in a simulation than not. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5856.02s)]
*  And that's like I had a long conversation with this guy [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5860.1s)]
*  about probability theory and simulations and according to probability theory, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5862.9s)]
*  we are in a simulation. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5866.82s)]
*  But it's like, how do you what does that mean? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5868.38s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5871.58s)]
*  Well, if there is a simulation, if it's possible, if there is [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5873.179999999999s)]
*  infinite galaxies out there, which we're pretty sure there are. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5876.74s)]
*  And there's infinite numbers of life forms that are [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5880.339999999999s)]
*  where we are and superior and then superior to that. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5885.5s)]
*  And then like every variation in between. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5889.54s)]
*  It's inevitable that someone is going to come up with something [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5892.0199999999995s)]
*  that's indistinguishable from reality or superior to it. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5895.7s)]
*  And maybe we're in that right now. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5899.7s)]
*  And if we are in that right now, you know. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5902.42s)]
*  How did you know? Yeah, how would you know? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5905.42s)]
*  I mean, maybe that is what life is. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5907.1s)]
*  Maybe that that is, you know, maybe that's exactly how it works out. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5908.78s)]
*  Self-evolving. Yeah. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5913.9800000000005s)]
*  Auto-correcting. Yeah. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5915.82s)]
*  And we think of it as like, oh, my God, it's not even life. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5917.06s)]
*  But maybe that is that is what the universe creates. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5919.42s)]
*  The Matrix did hit on a few things like that, which makes it a little bit. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5922.3s)]
*  There's a whole thing I remember after that came out with 98, 99. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5925.66s)]
*  Everyone was really thinking like that. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5928.3s)]
*  You're like, how would you know? Right. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5929.38s)]
*  And they had that they had that great little scene at the end was like, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5930.9s)]
*  you know, the first one failed because it was too perfect. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5933.5s)]
*  Yeah. You fucking humans needed failure. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5936.78s)]
*  You needed pain. You needed misery to make it work. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5938.94s)]
*  And that kind of auto-corrects back to you. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5942.42s)]
*  Yeah. Like at first, you'd go like, well, we can't be in isolation [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5944.219999999999s)]
*  because my life wouldn't suck so bad. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5946.54s)]
*  And you're like, well, actually, you know. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5947.94s)]
*  Yeah, maybe it would. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5950.66s)]
*  Maybe it would suck. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5951.98s)]
*  Well, maybe that's also what motivates people to continue to buy things and innovate. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5952.82s)]
*  I was going to say, without that, I want more. Right. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5957.099999999999s)]
*  How do you keep the machine going? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5960.3s)]
*  How do you keep the gerbil on the wheel? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5962.26s)]
*  And it's kind of like people inherently know it, which is why people are like, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5963.900000000001s)]
*  oh, I just want to camp by the by the lake. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5967.18s)]
*  Yeah, but they want to go buy a new tent and they want to buy a canteen. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5969.900000000001s)]
*  And they want they keep one. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5972.26s)]
*  They want everybody wants their kit, man. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5973.06s)]
*  Everybody loves kit. Yeah, they never stop. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5974.820000000001s)]
*  It never stops. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5976.860000000001s)]
*  It's a desire that human beings have that no other animal has. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5977.7s)]
*  Which is weird now, too, because it's not only just going out and camping. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5981.18s)]
*  They want to go out camping so they can share the experience with someone else. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5983.38s)]
*  Right. Times I'm still a little old school, so I don't really [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5985.78s)]
*  do the social media thing or anything. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5988.46s)]
*  But like you don't do it at all. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5989.9s)]
*  We have Instagram for the company. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5991.7s)]
*  That's that's good. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5993.86s)]
*  But you personally don't do it. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5994.94s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5996.78s)]
*  I'm so happy when I meet people that are just I would know how good for you. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=5998.139999999999s)]
*  Good for you. I'm going to say, Adrian, I'll let you talk to where I draw the line. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6002.74s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah, I'm like, get the fuck out of here. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6005.78s)]
*  Plus, it's Chinese spyware. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6008.54s)]
*  But yeah, exactly. Right. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6010.219999999999s)]
*  It's another way into the phone as opposed to what, though, American. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6011.7s)]
*  Well, I should say it like it's the same thing. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6014.379999999999s)]
*  It's just a different country. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6016.259999999999s)]
*  Who do you want? Who do you want? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6017.46s)]
*  Who do you want listening to? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6018.339999999999s)]
*  Well, that's this is interesting. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6019.18s)]
*  Like that car that I showed you that the [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6020.26s)]
*  Steve McQueen bullet car. Right. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6024.06s)]
*  I was Googling that. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6026.58s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it shows up on Instagram. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6027.66s)]
*  Shows up a bunch of them show up on Instagram. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6030.42s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck is this? [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6032.1s)]
*  Do you know many times? Yeah, of course. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6033.46s)]
*  How is that on my Instagram? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6034.740000000001s)]
*  I didn't look for it on Instagram. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6036.22s)]
*  They just cross reference. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6038.1s)]
*  Somebody sharing somehow or another. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6039.18s)]
*  It's getting in. Is this what you want? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6041.34s)]
*  I literally have a separate computer at work, completely dialed in [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6043.46s)]
*  like almost air camped off me because the shit I look up is pretty sketchy. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6046.86s)]
*  It's pretty sketchy. Yeah, that's probably smart. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6052.139999999999s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6054.179999999999s)]
*  And then I don't know. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6055.339999999999s)]
*  It's weird. People do experiences just to share them [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6057.0199999999995s)]
*  instead of experience. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6060.139999999999s)]
*  That's always been weird. That is weird. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6061.139999999999s)]
*  That's when people go camping just to let people know they're camping. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6062.94s)]
*  Like, look, if you love camping right on, because like, you know, [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6066.179999999999s)]
*  I don't need to video videotape myself rolling to know I love Jiu-Jitsu. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6068.78s)]
*  You know, I, you know, I want that. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6072.82s)]
*  But people do love to do that. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6075.219999999999s)]
*  They do it. Look at me. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6076.7s)]
*  Like, OK, that's a bit. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6078.78s)]
*  There's also value in it for some people that do it. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6079.74s)]
*  They're in that world, like competitors. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6082.82s)]
*  You know, absolutely. No, marketing is one thing. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6084.78s)]
*  Yeah. But when you're doing it as a social structure, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6086.46s)]
*  I think that can be damaging because you're not giving 100 percent. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6088.74s)]
*  You're not focusing. I think that's a really a lot of the. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6091.34s)]
*  It's a blurry line, though. It is. Right. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6094.099999999999s)]
*  Because it's weird. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6096.26s)]
*  I get a lot of our stunt teams are younger. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6097.22s)]
*  Obviously, they're younger. I call them kids, but they're in their 20s. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6099.58s)]
*  I mean, freak athletes. Fantastic. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6103.099999999999s)]
*  But that generation is completely woven into that. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6104.98s)]
*  Like, but again, we're in the entertainment industry. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6108.0599999999995s)]
*  So they're trying to get themselves out there because that's not how you get jobs. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6110.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like my day, you had to go knock on doors. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6112.98s)]
*  Now it's like put yourself out on Instagram, doing a cool trick. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6115.339999999999s)]
*  And now you get the next gig. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6118.299999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I can be the old crusty guy going, oh, you guys with your Instagram. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6119.78s)]
*  But to them, it is part it is a weird line because it is how they get work. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6123.82s)]
*  It's how they get themselves out there. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6127.419999999999s)]
*  Self branding is a part of our world now. Yeah. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6128.98s)]
*  But it is. It's weird where people just want to take pictures just for the gram. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6132.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. That's all they want. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6136.0199999999995s)]
*  They experience it and take pictures. Yeah. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6137.38s)]
*  But don't do it to take. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6138.98s)]
*  I met this guy at the gas station today and he asked to take a picture. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6140.54s)]
*  I go, sure. And he goes, don't worry, I won't post it. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6143.14s)]
*  I'm like, you know, pictures of me there are out there. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6146.06s)]
*  Go ahead and post it. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6150.0199999999995s)]
*  It was nice to say that's kind of nice. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6150.98s)]
*  No, that was. Yeah, it was nice. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6152.82s)]
*  It's weird that you have to say that. But yeah. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6154.34s)]
*  But I think he's a pretty old school guy. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6156.74s)]
*  Yeah. But the fact that he said that, don't worry, I won't post it. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6158.74s)]
*  Well, that's good. It wasn't for him to get recognition. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6161.42s)]
*  It was because he's actually a fan and he just wanted to show his, you know. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6163.22s)]
*  Well, he wanted to do it for his wife because he said his wife calls me [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6166.26s)]
*  his boyfriend or something like that. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6170.1s)]
*  And that he's a fan boy. All right. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6171.7s)]
*  OK. Little little deep with the story. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6175.02s)]
*  They're just some fucking, you know, oh, you got a man crush on Joe Rogan. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6176.9800000000005s)]
*  So he took a picture. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6180.66s)]
*  But he's like, don't worry, I won't post it. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6181.78s)]
*  That's interesting. I thought it was interesting at the time. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6183.66s)]
*  I was like, I don't care. It's OK. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6185.38s)]
*  But it was interesting that he like it was aware of that. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6187.06s)]
*  But that's I think that's a good thing. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6190.26s)]
*  That's a good thing. Yeah, that's a good man. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6191.66s)]
*  Yeah. But it's that the thing is like, does it exist? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6193.5s)]
*  You know, if a tree falls in the forest and you don't Instagram it, does it? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6197.74s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6203.26s)]
*  I mean, it's an inevitable inevitability. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6204.26s)]
*  You know, and my kids are like firmly entrenched in that world. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6206.78s)]
*  You know, born with cell phone in hand. Yeah. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6210.22s)]
*  You know, that's it. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6211.98s)]
*  What's shocking to me is how well they are at navigating things. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6213.0599999999995s)]
*  How have you seen like, you know, I have a 10 [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6217.58s)]
*  flying through that iPad. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6222.78s)]
*  Crazy. I'm like, I can't I'm still looking for my email. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6224.34s)]
*  Right. They know how to edit shit. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6226.42s)]
*  My daughter figured out when she first got a phone [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6227.62s)]
*  that if she screen records because my wife gave her a time limit on it, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6231.86s)]
*  but it was a password time limit thing. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6236.42s)]
*  So she would have to give it to my wife to get extra screen time. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6238.9s)]
*  So she set screen record. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6242.34s)]
*  So she knew when so she just rewound it and like she's doing the bank. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6244.7s)]
*  I six nine, whatever the fuck the number is. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6248.9s)]
*  She literally did the bank heist. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6251.179999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, first of all, I want to give her a knuckles. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6252.86s)]
*  A plus for figuring that out. That's pretty dope. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6255.94s)]
*  I like how you did. That's that's a clever little craftiness is a big skill. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6258.099999999999s)]
*  Well, it's like they're they're like little prisoners. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6261.46s)]
*  You know, prisoners figure out all kinds of stuff to do because that is necessity. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6264.46s)]
*  They figure out a way to make things and manufacture their own stuff. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6268.3s)]
*  Isn't that a true? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6272.22s)]
*  Like I was, you know, people always come up and ask like, OK, I want to get into directing. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6273.06s)]
*  How do I get into directing? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6277.14s)]
*  I'm like, OK, what have you directed? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6278.34s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? Well, you have an iPhone, right? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6280.26s)]
*  I mean, do you see what these things can do? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6282.7s)]
*  Like, yeah, you know, we had the big, big VHS cameras to VCR. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6284.58s)]
*  That's like with an iPhone. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6289.18s)]
*  Like, so let me get this straight. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6291.34s)]
*  You can edit, shoot color, correct, sound, correct sound effect, visual effect. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6292.58s)]
*  Like you did all you can do. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6297.7s)]
*  You can edit it on the phone. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6299.58s)]
*  And I've like, again, my 10 year old like niece and nephew can fly. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6301.46s)]
*  Yeah, they're so good. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6306.46s)]
*  They do effects. You do slow motion. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6307.82s)]
*  I've seen stuff that like, you know, wire removal. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6310.1s)]
*  Yeah, you full on composition. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6312.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Like it's unbelievable. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6314.78s)]
*  It's unbelievable. And it's just they're free apps. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6316.54s)]
*  What's all the photo ones you get different heads on? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6319.02s)]
*  Yeah, you can start deep faking people literally on your iPhone. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6321.26s)]
*  That's another thing is fucking people up as these filters [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6324.9s)]
*  where girls see these girls that have this perfect face and perfect. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6327.66s)]
*  And they don't realize that it's a filter. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6331.26s)]
*  It's Photoshop. Yeah. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6333.42s)]
*  Photoshopped basically. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6334.66s)]
*  You're looking at animation. Yeah. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6336.1s)]
*  It's a version of animation applied to an actual human being. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6337.5s)]
*  Isn't that creepy, though? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6340.62s)]
*  But everybody thinks that's what you have to be. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6341.42s)]
*  Yeah. It's what it's we you know, there's a lot of effects companies [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6343.5s)]
*  nowadays that are do stolly cosmetic work, you know, not just to, you know, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6347.1s)]
*  fix scars or inconsistently fly away hairs and stuff. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6351.66s)]
*  But you can do the level of what's possible cosmetically [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6353.900000000001s)]
*  in digital work right now is pretty fascinating. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6358.42s)]
*  One of my wife's friends was a model and they would take photos of her [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6360.66s)]
*  with no makeup on. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6364.42s)]
*  It was all no makeup. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6365.7s)]
*  And they put it all on afterwards. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6366.74s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6367.98s)]
*  Like she's basically a canvas. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6369.0199999999995s)]
*  See, that's you know, now you go to AI and you go to like, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6371.82s)]
*  I know a lot of actors have deals. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6374.62s)]
*  You cannot digitally alter their image in any way. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6376.3s)]
*  Canna tells a story when we were talking about AI [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6379.42s)]
*  a while ago was like, you know, he had done a certain performance [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6382.3s)]
*  and they had added a digital tier. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6385.82s)]
*  It seems so subtle and so trivial, but it did change the performance. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6388.82s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6393.98s)]
*  So you've come in, you've committed to a performance and someone's changed it. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6394.58s)]
*  Yeah. Your knowledge like that's granted. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6398.5s)]
*  That's that's beyond editing because we can choose different takes. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6400.9s)]
*  But still, it was augmenting a performance that was never given. Right. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6402.98s)]
*  You know, that's just the tip of what you could do. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6405.86s)]
*  Now, what if you started digitally enhancing smiles or frowns? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6408.219999999999s)]
*  Are you giving it like it's not just a look, it's not cosmetic, it's performance. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6410.62s)]
*  Yeah, you can alter so much about a person's facial features in a film. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6414.42s)]
*  Well, what just I mean, I do it in this, you know, we do face replacements all the time, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6418.62s)]
*  you know, not on camera, but on some of the other cast [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6422.82s)]
*  or when we're doing a dangerous stunt or we have like a helmet on a guy [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6424.82s)]
*  will erase it and put a put a nondescript person's face or head on it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6427.46s)]
*  It's fucking cake. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6432.82s)]
*  It's really easy, which is scary. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6434.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. You're laughing about it when you're in the theater and you're editing. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6436.66s)]
*  But you're like, well, that's what my thought is that in the future, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6439.18s)]
*  will you even have to make that scene? [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6442.22s)]
*  Can it all be done with AI? [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6443.78s)]
*  Because I think right now there's that uncanny valley, right? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6445.82s)]
*  We see AI scenes, you know, like, oh, that's not real. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6449.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. You know, like in Game of Thrones, like when they have the dire wolves [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6451.86s)]
*  walking around, you're like, that's not a real wolf. Right. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6454.94s)]
*  But how far away are we from totally being? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6457.219999999999s)]
*  I think you could do it now. It's time and money. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6460.9s)]
*  If you watch if you gave a digital artist enough time with just the technology [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6463.46s)]
*  we have today, you could do a digital character and work with the. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6467.099999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's time, but we can do that. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6471.099999999999s)]
*  We can make it look photo real. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6473.54s)]
*  It's just it's the it's the organicness, right? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6475.5s)]
*  It's that heaviness when you step or it's the income. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6477.54s)]
*  It's almost too perfect. It's the inconsistency. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6480.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's the fucked up hair. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6482.22s)]
*  It's the, you know, the little like, you know, gesture that you can't figure out. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6484.14s)]
*  Or the person. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6488.14s)]
*  Well, the Steve Buscemi. Yeah, exactly. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6489.78s)]
*  The the the unpredictability, the nuttiness that you can't quite get. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6492.06s)]
*  But that's just a matter of time. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6495.66s)]
*  That's just time. Yeah. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6497.26s)]
*  But the technology is there. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6498.74s)]
*  If they're just going to take all the weird characters [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6499.78s)]
*  that have ever existed and come up with one. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6502.46s)]
*  Well, then you get an algorithm to pull the aggregate [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6504.54s)]
*  of all the fucked up weirdness out there. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6506.98s)]
*  And how do you spit that out? Right. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6508.74s)]
*  It's basically a version of these Alex Gray paintings. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6510.54s)]
*  They're just going to take all the weird guys that. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6512.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, I don't I don't I don't doubt it. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6514.54s)]
*  And the actors, you know, I mean, that's why a lot of directors get into animation. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6516.38s)]
*  There's very other other than, you know, taking references and stuff. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6519.98s)]
*  But like no one's calling. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6523.78s)]
*  I mean, those those animators, they're drawing their characters from somewhere. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6525.18s)]
*  Yeah. Whether it's a person they see in the street or it's a tech in video [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6529.5s)]
*  or it's, you know, a taekwondo match. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6532.46s)]
*  They're taking that action from somewhere and then they're embellishing upon it. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6534.26s)]
*  So like, you know, no one's calling them out on where they're drawn it. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6538.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's just such a strange world that we live in now, especially I'm 55. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6541.66s)]
*  I don't know how. 54. Yeah. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6546.18s)]
*  So we're essentially we grew up in the age where we were there [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6547.62s)]
*  when the answering machine came about. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6552.22s)]
*  We were there when we had. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6554.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we had pagers. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6556.74s)]
*  We were there when the VHS came about. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6557.860000000001s)]
*  Like those were to go from that to where we are today. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6560.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking insane. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6563.98s)]
*  And to try to figure out what's next, like where the future is. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6565.339999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, it's like, what the fuck? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6569.099999999999s)]
*  That was just in the last, God, what, 20, 30 years. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6570.98s)]
*  And then Apple released that thing today. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6573.54s)]
*  Did they release it? Do we know what it is? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6575.62s)]
*  I'm like, I'm looking. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6577.379999999999s)]
*  It's it's going to cost me expensive. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6578.58s)]
*  It's not going to come out till next year, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6581.7s)]
*  but it's got a headset and I'll try to find a picture. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6583.54s)]
*  It's they just released some new Apple [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6586.62s)]
*  AR headset that's supposed to be a real game changer. Really? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6589.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be augmented reality and virtual reality. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6593.3s)]
*  With the goggles. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6598.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's got see through those. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6599.46s)]
*  So like there's a picture I've seen on this one. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6601.7s)]
*  I'll show it. You can see to their eyes through it. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6603.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. What does it do? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6606.18s)]
*  Does it layer in reality? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6608.18s)]
*  Yeah. OK, so it's augmented. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6609.42s)]
*  And that might be able to shut off and you can do some VR stuff. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6611.42s)]
*  I haven't seen that. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6614.02s)]
*  We're doing the shows. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6615.22s)]
*  This might be the step. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6615.9800000000005s)]
*  This might be the one. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6618.74s)]
*  Touch. No controllers. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6620.1s)]
*  So it's all with your hands. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6622.42s)]
*  Right. That's what I'm saying. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6623.58s)]
*  But you can project the hologram and then you. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6624.26s)]
*  So minority report style. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6626.34s)]
*  Yeah, minority reporting. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6627.74s)]
*  Moving stuff around. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6628.66s)]
*  Underrated film. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6630.46s)]
*  Yeah, very underrated film. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6631.5s)]
*  Yeah, here's everything. This is it. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6633.3s)]
*  So you get. So was that a screen? [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6635.26s)]
*  So you're watching. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6637.5s)]
*  They do have a controller there, but maybe you don't need it. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6638.34s)]
*  So you're playing video game there, I think. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6640.5s)]
*  Oh, so you play the video game right in front of your face. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6641.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'll see the world around you. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6645.02s)]
*  Oh, wow. Screen. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6647.38s)]
*  So there's no screens. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6649.5s)]
*  You're watching a movie. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6650.38s)]
*  But that could just be a screen. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6652.0599999999995s)]
*  I won't. I don't want that. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6653.34s)]
*  What I want is full immersion. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6655.0599999999995s)]
*  What you know, like that's that's what I'm interested in [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6657.18s)]
*  when it comes to like video games and films, like full immersion. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6659.5s)]
*  I have to do. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6662.7s)]
*  We'll find out. You're talking. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6663.5s)]
*  You don't want to see the world. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6664.62s)]
*  Yeah. You wrapped it. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6665.78s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's it's going to get real. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6666.82s)]
*  Well, that's what you're talking about earlier when you're talking about [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6669.26s)]
*  like the Wally thing, you had a bunch of people sitting chairs. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6671.62s)]
*  Now you're watching. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6674.5s)]
*  You got your family on couch instead of watching a TV together. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6675.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6678.54s)]
*  Goggles on and you have five individuals in their own world. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6679.26s)]
*  That's very bizarre. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6682.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. You're all watching a show together, but then your kid sneaks in porn. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6684.3s)]
*  Yeah. And you got another show. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6687.740000000001s)]
*  How's that going? It's great, Dad. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6688.780000000001s)]
*  It's great. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6690.58s)]
*  That does it does end up doing what you were asking for. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6690.9800000000005s)]
*  So here's just a little video that showed at the event. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6693.34s)]
*  So here's the guys like looking at different screens [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6695.38s)]
*  that would be on his phone or computer. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6697.66s)]
*  And this thing then expands out here in a second. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6699.9800000000005s)]
*  He probably hit a button. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6702.3s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6703.900000000001s)]
*  And then shows it taking over your whole room. Whoa. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6704.820000000001s)]
*  He's floating in space, watching. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6708.94s)]
*  You're not going to get anybody to leave the house in 20 years. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6710.219999999999s)]
*  It's going to be very strange. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6713.9s)]
*  Very strange. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6716.78s)]
*  And we had to go to a bar. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6718.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Remember those days? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6719.74s)]
*  You just told your friend to meet me somewhere. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6721.179999999999s)]
*  Those days are still. Oh, yeah. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6722.74s)]
*  You had to meet him. You couldn't call him. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6724.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I remember those days when I used to go to the pool hall. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6726.0199999999995s)]
*  The most valuable thing was the pay phone. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6728.62s)]
*  Because people would call the pay for how many quarters that you used to walk around. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6731.259999999999s)]
*  We'd have our pager and stunts. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6734.139999999999s)]
*  You'd have about 10 minutes to get back to the answering service [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6735.82s)]
*  if you were available or not. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6738.42s)]
*  So you pull off the 405, find a pay phone and put those quarters in. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6739.42s)]
*  You always had that roll of quarters. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6742.82s)]
*  I remember the phone cards, too. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6744.46s)]
*  Yeah. Phone cards. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6746.179999999999s)]
*  You had to slide them in. Sometimes they worked, sometimes they didn't. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6747.3s)]
*  Yeah. Fucking strange. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6749.34s)]
*  Strange world we live in now. Yeah. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6752.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, who would have ever thought that everyone would have a phone on them [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6754.46s)]
*  everywhere you go? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6757.94s)]
*  Not even kids. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6759.179999999999s)]
*  And none of that. You don't need the computer after a while. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6760.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The computer is kind of an afterthought now. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6762.34s)]
*  It's just so you can see something. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6763.94s)]
*  But you can do it all on your phone. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6765.02s)]
*  Yeah, I used to always travel with a laptop. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6766.02s)]
*  Like if I was going on the road, I always and now all my notes are on my phone. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6768.820000000001s)]
*  On my phone or at most I'll take an iPad. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6772.3s)]
*  Yeah. It tops. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6774.620000000001s)]
*  And it's just to read on. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6775.860000000001s)]
*  I know. So strange. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6777.14s)]
*  Such a strange time. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6779.02s)]
*  On set, like you know, people like, you know, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6780.06s)]
*  you just give people just through their phone. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6783.860000000001s)]
*  There's everything's happening and moving. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6785.38s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know how else you'd do it now to be that efficient. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6787.5s)]
*  Well, it definitely makes you more productive and more efficient. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6790.22s)]
*  You can get a lot done. Yeah. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6792.780000000001s)]
*  And with the right motivation, like you say, with the right people, it's a tool. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6794.62s)]
*  Right. People, it becomes a distraction. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6798.34s)]
*  Yeah, but it's just most people do not have the kind of discipline [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6800.22s)]
*  that's required to like to manage the technology we have. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6803.74s)]
*  Yeah. And I get it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6807.14s)]
*  And as it comes, it gets stronger. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6809.099999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, maybe you have the discipline to avoid coffee. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6810.9s)]
*  Do you have the discipline to avoid meth? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6814.58s)]
*  Exactly. That's what your iPhone is. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6817.14s)]
*  I think it's brain meth. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6820.62s)]
*  And it's also like if you're doing meth, you know you're fucking up. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6822.7s)]
*  Right. What if your doctor gives you the meth? [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6826.26s)]
*  You know, it's great. Like we're doing now. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6827.78s)]
*  Like we say something, he pulls it up. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6829.26s)]
*  It's good for research. It's good for that. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6830.62s)]
*  But like it also can be that like, don't you want to think about it a little bit? [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6832.98s)]
*  It doesn't always have to be a reference. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6836.34s)]
*  It doesn't always have to be what's on YouTube. Right. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6837.86s)]
*  YouTube has become the new encyclopedia botanica. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6840.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And you take it as real, which is the scary part. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6843.34s)]
*  Oh, that's the scary part. You know what I mean? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6846.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like, oh, it's on YouTube. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6847.74s)]
*  If you have gullible friends and they send you things, you're like, hey, man, that's not real. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6848.78s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6852.06s)]
*  Don't you need to like Google that thing and then debunked? [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6854.14s)]
*  In fact, don't even Google it. Go to Duck Duck Go. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6858.860000000001s)]
*  Well, like there are people that are actually like great story idea. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6861.34s)]
*  Yeah. They'll Google it. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6865.26s)]
*  They'll actually Google. Oh, yeah. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6866.580000000001s)]
*  Great story idea or a great script or great action sequence. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6867.660000000001s)]
*  Well, I will do it for you now. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6871.06s)]
*  Chat GPT will do that for you. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6872.780000000001s)]
*  And this is just chat GPT for you know, what happens when they get to chat GPT 30? [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6874.46s)]
*  So again, to all that, it's like, OK, so let's think like if you're not inputting it, right? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6880.219999999999s)]
*  Right. Just asking it and you take that idea. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6886.86s)]
*  Is that copyright? Right. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6890.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's where the funky right? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6892.0599999999995s)]
*  Because like you can do something. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6894.259999999999s)]
*  You could be the programmer. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6895.58s)]
*  You're doing the copyright infringement. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6896.82s)]
*  But if I'm the one benefiting it by Google, you're like doing the AI thing. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6898.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. Am I infringing? [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6901.179999999999s)]
*  It's a very good question. You know what I mean? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6903.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, it can code websites for you now, like really quickly, like instantaneously. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6905.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. They can do code flawlessly. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6908.94s)]
*  They can do so many different things. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6911.099999999999s)]
*  So what does it do that industry? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6912.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it's going to kill so many industries. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6914.46s)]
*  I mean, this is something that Andrew Yang was talking about with automation. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6917.0199999999995s)]
*  But I don't think he anticipated or things like this. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6919.98s)]
*  Why the creative aspect of business is a whole nother level. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6923.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know what I mean? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6927.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird visual graphic art in general. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6929.54s)]
*  Right. Architectural design would be the right. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6932.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6935.099999999999s)]
*  I think really anything like that, the coding especially. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6936.66s)]
*  And it can do it instantaneously, stuff that would take people months. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6939.42s)]
*  I know, months. What's the waiting time? [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6942.5s)]
*  Eight minutes. Right. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6944.7s)]
*  No need for creativity. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6945.82s)]
*  No need to be sitting alone bored, just trying to figure out ideas, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6947.18s)]
*  just trying to get those ideas to pop into your head. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6950.98s)]
*  I think that's, you know, they call it like zero to one learning, right? [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6953.0199999999995s)]
*  I hand you a blank piece of paper. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6955.78s)]
*  Give me a great idea. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6958.0199999999995s)]
*  That's different than if I give you a shitty idea and I say, OK, Joe, fix it. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6959.42s)]
*  Right. Like that's one to ten thinking. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6963.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. You can like I'm good at like someone gives me a shitty secret. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6965.14s)]
*  I can make a better sequence. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6968.14s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the zero to one is that that's what they really pay for [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6969.18s)]
*  to come up with the original cool idea. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6972.22s)]
*  That was a problem with Joke Thieves because Joke Thieves would go to open [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6973.780000000001s)]
*  mic nights and they would watch amateurs, but amateurs that had like a pretty good premise. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6977.780000000001s)]
*  Right. But they just didn't. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6982.26s)]
*  Yeah, didn't quite have it yet. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6983.54s)]
*  Oh, I know how to do that. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6984.660000000001s)]
*  So a professional would sit in the back of that open mic night and watch the open. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6986.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It was a real issue. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6990.26s)]
*  Really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6992.700000000001s)]
*  I never would have thought of that. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6994.02s)]
*  Well, they've all been busted. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6994.82s)]
*  Most of them have been busted. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6996.099999999999s)]
*  But how do you get busted on that? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6997.7s)]
*  Comics, other comics. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=6999.139999999999s)]
*  And then now the YouTube people, the YouTube people will take bits [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7000.9s)]
*  and show that this is where it came from. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7004.42s)]
*  And some pretty prominent people have been busted doing that. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7006.66s)]
*  Really? Yeah, because it's just. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7009.98s)]
*  It's too easy. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7012.82s)]
*  Like if someone like I'm really good at, like if a young comic says, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7013.86s)]
*  I got this idea, it can't work or go tell me the bit and they'll tell me that. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7018.46s)]
*  So I'm fresh. Right. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7021.58s)]
*  Like I'm looking at it completely from the outside, [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7023.1s)]
*  but they already have structure. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7025.9800000000005s)]
*  So I go, OK, OK, cut that part out and put it in the front and say, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7027.740000000001s)]
*  just set it up with almost like the punch line. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7032.46s)]
*  And then your new punch line is this. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7035.1s)]
*  Oh, layered it. Yeah. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7037.26s)]
*  You just figure out a way. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7039.3s)]
*  But I didn't have the idea. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7040.780000000001s)]
*  There's the ideas of the hardest thing, the hardest premises [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7042.3s)]
*  for standup comedy in particular. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7046.14s)]
*  There are some of the hardest things to acquire, a good thing to talk about. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7047.5s)]
*  And there's things that everybody talks about like Biden falls down. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7052.0599999999995s)]
*  Ha ha. Everybody talks about it. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7054.9s)]
*  It's it's like simple. It's easy. It's right there for everybody. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7056.46s)]
*  So there's a lot of parallel thinking. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7059.299999999999s)]
*  But then like weird premises, like someone who takes something [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7061.219999999999s)]
*  that no one ever would have thought would be comedy and then turns that into a bit. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7065.219999999999s)]
*  Well, if that person's an amateur [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7069.62s)]
*  and someone sitting in the back of the room, they're kind of clunky [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7071.9s)]
*  with their way of doing it. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7074.099999999999s)]
*  But the person who's a pro sees him goes, I can fix that. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7075.94s)]
*  And then they just steal it. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7079.9s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7081.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7083.0199999999995s)]
*  So when you ask a I to write jokes for you, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7084.1s)]
*  how do you know if a is not stealing it from a blog? Right. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7088.18s)]
*  Because a is scouring the entire Internet. Right. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7091.42s)]
*  So they could be getting it from all sorts of different people's [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7095.26s)]
*  intellectual property. Right. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7098.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7100.1s)]
*  I think even even more to that is again, what the writers are saying about now [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7101.5s)]
*  is like, you know, they're paid on their first pass or say they're paying passes. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7106.42s)]
*  You know, pass the script, pass the script. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7110.74s)]
*  And they get paid less for a rewrite than they do an original idea. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7113.22s)]
*  I think what they're most concerned about, and I could have this wrong, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7116.74s)]
*  but what I was told by a lot of my writer friends is that, you know, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7119.22s)]
*  a real concern is no one's trying to replace writers with with, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7122.7s)]
*  you know, the the finished draft. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7127.3s)]
*  Yeah. And AI can carry out a shitty draft. Yes. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7129.34s)]
*  And then they can hire a human to do the second draft. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7132.3s)]
*  Yeah. At like half price. Yeah. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7134.7s)]
*  Like that's it. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7136.78s)]
*  So like, AI is pumping out the shitty first. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7137.46s)]
*  So, you know, that's the thing. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7139.9s)]
*  So what's a human like you're saying? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7141.26s)]
*  What's a human first draft? What's a yeah. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7142.7s)]
*  What's a first draft? What's a second? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7144.74s)]
*  And we're talking about a business that already has a bunch of shady practices. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7145.98s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, everybody's copying everybody. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7149.74s)]
*  Everybody's stealing ideas. Everybody's doing it. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7151.46s)]
*  But, you know, whether you're evolving those ideas, [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7153.099999999999s)]
*  whether you're just straight out ripping them off, whether they're inspiring you, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7155.0599999999995s)]
*  you're still you're still using off getting it from something. Right. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7157.58s)]
*  Well, we're all influenced by everything that's been created before. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7160.86s)]
*  Well, that's life. Right. Yeah. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7164.26s)]
*  You can't stop being influenced. Of course. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7165.54s)]
*  That's why you people watch. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7167.7s)]
*  That's why you get all your material. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7168.58s)]
*  That's how I get my retail. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7170.14s)]
*  We just go out and watch. We observe. Yeah. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7170.94s)]
*  Or read, you know, whatever. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7173.5s)]
*  There's a guy I used to do Jiu Jitsu with and he was a screenwriter. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7174.94s)]
*  And he brought a screen. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7178.58s)]
*  He brought a screenplay. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7181.3s)]
*  He brought a fully formed script to a very prominent production company. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7182.5s)]
*  And they stole it. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7188.66s)]
*  They completely stole it and made a blockbuster film. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7190.34s)]
*  And he went to court with them and won and got credited in the film. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7192.82s)]
*  But it was a battle. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7197.139999999999s)]
*  It was a fucking battle. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7198.54s)]
*  And he probably had as a draft right there. Oh, yeah. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7199.62s)]
*  And he also had the papers. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7201.9s)]
*  He had all the documentation that showed that he had registered. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7204.34s)]
*  That's what the WTA is for. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7207.66s)]
*  Yeah. So they would do all that. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7208.38s)]
*  But it's just dirty as fuck. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7209.38s)]
*  They just took it and they're like, well, let them fucking sue us. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7211.74s)]
*  And that's what he did, because they're like, no, fuck you. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7214.86s)]
*  He's like, fuck you. I met with you. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7217.7s)]
*  I gave you this idea and like, fuck you. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7219.62s)]
*  Like, we're huge and you're some guy. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7222.139999999999s)]
*  And, you know, don't fucking cause trouble or you're never going to work again. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7224.18s)]
*  That's a horror story. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7228.22s)]
*  It's scary. But that is how common is that in Hollywood? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7229.18s)]
*  It again, it's that fucking soft line because you're so inspired [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7233.42s)]
*  and everybody's everybody like, this wasn't inspired. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7237.54s)]
*  I think no. What I'm saying is this was the star that he wrote it for. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7239.58s)]
*  One of starring in the movie. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7243.3s)]
*  That's probably how they got caught. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7244.9400000000005s)]
*  That was a little too on the nose. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7246.1s)]
*  But like that's I think a lot of see you stay with existing IP. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7247.3s)]
*  That's why, you know, comic books. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7250.5s)]
*  You get a book like you're not going to run to a battle. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7252.219999999999s)]
*  I am doing the book. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7254.58s)]
*  There's no interpretation. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7255.82s)]
*  It's not like you said, yeah, you and I didn't have this. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7256.94s)]
*  Hey, we got this idea for like this lizard guy. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7258.98s)]
*  And then we just write it up in parallel thinking. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7261.099999999999s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7264.259999999999s)]
*  You have a little lukewarmness there. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7265.219999999999s)]
*  But but for people like that, like that have come up with a thing [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7266.66s)]
*  and had it stolen. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7270.74s)]
*  A.I. So scary. Well, yeah. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7272.379999999999s)]
*  Again, that's that's a double whammy. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7275.259999999999s)]
*  And what if it can get into Google Docs? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7276.82s)]
*  Right. What if you uploaded to the cloud? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7279.339999999999s)]
*  And so you've got all your shit sitting up there on your notes, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7281.74s)]
*  all your personal thoughts, all your diaries, all your drafts. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7284.66s)]
*  All of it. I guess that's the real thing. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7287.74s)]
*  People now like, you know, I have a notebook and notebook and notebook. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7289.38s)]
*  I'm sure you do, too, of like all your past ideas. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7291.78s)]
*  I still have hard copies, but a lot of people I know have all their, [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7293.82s)]
*  you know, like my production designer, all designs that are yet to be experienced. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7297.139999999999s)]
*  That's all uploaded. It's not all digital. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7300.94s)]
*  Yeah. Shit that's never made it out. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7302.74s)]
*  Like I have like three or four ideas that haven't made it out yet [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7304.9s)]
*  that are fully flushed. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7307.42s)]
*  And like, you know, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7309.139999999999s)]
*  somebody gets a hold of that. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7311.42s)]
*  You're like, you can't argue with them because they haven't written a thing yet. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7312.34s)]
*  Right. You know, and they're like, oh, that was funny. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7314.62s)]
*  We both had that space fantasy. Yeah. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7316.78s)]
*  Interesting, right? [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7319.62s)]
*  It's a weird world we live in. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7320.98s)]
*  And in your world, the world of creating these entertainment properties, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7322.42s)]
*  these things like John Wick, it's like [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7329.38s)]
*  that that's a world where you're like more likely to get poached. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7333.139999999999s)]
*  I think so. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7337.78s)]
*  But again, I'm going to go, yeah, it does suck. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7338.74s)]
*  And we should at least start the talks about how to protect ourselves [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7341.86s)]
*  against that or what it could be. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7345.5s)]
*  But at the same time, like, look, if you're creative, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7346.74s)]
*  if you have good ideas, you're going to keep coming. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7349.34s)]
*  So to answer your earlier question, yeah, I'm going to give it a go again. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7351.54s)]
*  I'm working on this project called Highlander. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7354.0599999999995s)]
*  We're going to redo Highlander a little bit. Really? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7356.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. No shit. I loved Highlander. Highlander is awesome. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7358.34s)]
*  I'm super stoked to do something with that. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7361.54s)]
*  We have Ghost of Shishima on the plates, the video [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7363.74s)]
*  based on the video game, the samurai film. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7366.66s)]
*  Rainbow Six. Those are the three I'm working on. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7369.34s)]
*  Yeah, we need a good samurai movie. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7371.18s)]
*  When was the last time there was a good samurai? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Qovn60uQQ&t=7372.58s)]
