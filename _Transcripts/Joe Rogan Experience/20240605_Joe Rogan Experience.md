# Joe Rogan Experience #2161 - Tony Hinchcliffe
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgL6F4cajas)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Shrain by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day!
*  What's it like to be the king of the world Tony Hitchcock?
*  I got to talk some shit.
*  You're killing it man. It's exciting. It's an exciting time for you.
*  Yeah.
*  I hope you're enjoying it.
*  Oh I'm having a blast.
*  Is it weird? Does it feel weird?
*  Kind of because I wasn't expecting like a big moment or like a different boom, a different outside thing because I'm just content here, chilling.
*  I had my Kill Tony stuff and all of our stuff and but yeah, it's awesome.
*  It's so interesting to watch. It was funny that Bryan Simpson said he was with you at the store and he said he watched Tony Hitchcock become real famous in real time.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you could see like with the first show when you're warming up, get ready for the roast, then after the roast, people just going crazy.
*  Yeah, it was weird. I got bumped by another comedian my first night at the store and then I was the special guest super treat the rest of the week.
*  Like it was like I was the secret weapon kind of so I was unbumpable.
*  We should be bumped anyway. Bumping is horse shit.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing that it was around the store back in the old days and they should have got rid of it a long time ago.
*  You know, it's one thing if like some superstar Dave Chappelle type Chris Rock character wants to pop in, Louis CK is in town and they want to do 15 minutes, you know, that's all great.
*  But what used to happen to the store is you would get these comedians that were just doing it for an ego flex.
*  They were just doing it because they wanted to be able to bump other folks on the roster and then they would do like a fucking 45 minute set and ruin the timeline of the show.
*  Everybody's supposed to do 15 minutes. There's like fucking 16 people on the show.
*  It's a long ass show.
*  What? How many people are on 16? Is it 16?
*  I don't know if it still is. It might be 14 or 12 or something.
*  A lot of fucking pandemic.
*  Yeah, it's crazy that some people will sit there from show open.
*  They will sit there from 8 p.m. and they will be there till 2 a.m.
*  I've seen it. Oh, yeah. I've seen it many a times.
*  Some people are just like, especially those tourists, comedy tourists.
*  Yeah, they'd come there from Australia and Ireland and shit.
*  Yeah, they don't want to miss it. We're getting a lot of those at the mothership, man.
*  There's a lot of people from other countries. They're telling me they're flying in for this all the time.
*  It's wild. They come in, they do like a weekend, then they go do Till Kill Tony and then do like one of our shows.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  Yeah, I always ask now during the commercial break where I get to talk directly to the Kill Tony audience
*  and I ask how many of you live in Austin, Texas? Make some noise.
*  How many of you flew in just for this? And it's always a bigger pop.
*  Isn't that wild? Yeah.
*  It's like the city's become like a vacation destination for stand up.
*  For the arts, I think. I think you can come here and listen to live music, the best, and live comedy.
*  And get to see a lot of fucking freaks.
*  Yeah, it's just fucking what a time we're in, man. Yeah. Boy, did we get lucky.
*  I mean, we just keep getting lucky, dude. Having Shane here is a death blow to the other cities.
*  Took him out on his first boat trip on Sunday and we drank.
*  Of course, if you were Shane, you're drinking. Did you drink Bud Lights or did you drink real alcohol?
*  I drank whiskey cokes. He drank Bud Lights. We always fucking meet.
*  Yeah, that dude can put them away. We not fuck around with Shane Gillis.
*  Do not try to drink with Shane Gillis. We had so much fun cracking up, man.
*  Listening to Drake on the river. That's awesome. He's the best. Yeah.
*  It's so nice having him here and it's so nice having Joey here all the time now.
*  Joey's coming again in a week. Unbelievable. Yeah. I was just with him in New Jersey. Yeah.
*  He was so hilarious. He was so hilarious at the fights. He was out of his mind.
*  That's what I was telling Lewis is like even the few people that we really want that haven't moved here are coming here all the time.
*  Like it's a Vegas residency or something like that. Yeah. Theo was there too at the fights and he's coming in July. Yeah.
*  So we'll do more stuff with him too. Yeah. It's just we're we're lucky shit, dude.
*  I mean, I say it all the time, but it's almost like the universe wanted this to happen this way.
*  It just seems like every light just turned green right when we got up to it.
*  Unbelievable. It didn't make sense. Like this isn't going to work. Green light.
*  This isn't going to work. Green light. This is it. It's my work. Green light. Oh shit. It's happening. Green light.
*  It's wild. Yeah. And it's a special fucking place. Yeah. I love this city with all my heart.
*  I you know, I never thought I would leave L.A.
*  And then when the shit hit the fan and riots and governments and you realize taxes are absolutely insane for what we were getting.
*  And I feel more at home here than I ever did there.
*  And I was there for almost 20 years. Yeah.
*  But when the planes landing and you look out the right side and you see downtown Austin instead of downtown L.A., it feels more like, oh, yeah.
*  It's a better place for comedy, too, in terms of like you.
*  You don't have the traffic. It's not a grind. It's the middle of the country.
*  So if you want to travel to other cities, it's easy to get to the club situation is amazing.
*  There's so many clubs. There's Cab City. There's Creek in the Cave.
*  There's the Vulcan. There's a Sunset Strip. There's the mothership.
*  There's what else? The Black Rabbit. Black Rabbit.
*  The Alveda Room. Shakespeare's. It's crazy. It's crazy.
*  It's an amazing situation. It's like, you know, and you realize like, you don't have to.
*  You don't have to live like that. You have to be stuck in this crazy city of insane traffic and crime.
*  Right. I can see five comedy clubs from my windows and where I live.
*  And I don't even think anybody in New York has that.
*  I don't think you can look down and see five comedy clubs from where you're at at any given point.
*  Look, New York has more clubs and more people. And New York's awesome. It's not a contest. Right.
*  You know, it's not a contest. It's like that whole like New York is the best.
*  I don't know. If you like it, it's the best. Like it's whatever's great.
*  Whatever's great for you. Right. But this is a crazy place right now.
*  And, you know, LA used to be crazy. And now LA is just a fucking steaming pile.
*  It's on fire. It's just fucked. Speaking of fire, do you see this guy?
*  You know what that is? In Mexico. Oh, we need to Google this too.
*  Because Mexico has a new president.
*  And I heard that 30 plus presidential candidates were assassinated.
*  Oh, that might be just a tick tock meme.
*  So I have to find out. So let's find out in real time.
*  But the sky, the reason why the sky is so cloudy looking, that's smoke from wildfires in Mexico.
*  Oh, wow. They did a controlled burn and they whoops.
*  Oh, boy. Whoopsies. Whoops.
*  Whoops. Listen, 37. Excuse me.
*  Claudia Scheinbaum was elected the country's first female president after a bloody election campaign that saw 37 candidates assassinated.
*  And that's our neighbor. We live next to a fucking crack house.
*  That's on fire. A crack house on fire run by a Jew.
*  The first lady, first lady.
*  More than three dozen candidates were assassinated, including a local government candidate in central Puebla state.
*  It was killed on Friday, increasing the total number of those killed at 37.
*  Who the fuck would want to run for office in Mexico?
*  Dude, that is so crazy. That is so crazy.
*  Look how few people look. Twenty thousand positions to fill and seventy thousand candidates.
*  If you have twenty thousand positions in America, how many candidates?
*  Probably a lot more because nobody's getting assassinated.
*  That would be one way to start fitting the herd.
*  Yeah. Taking them out.
*  I mean, how far away? I mean, sounds crazy, right?
*  This is Mexico. It's not America.
*  How far away are we from like seeing another JFK type situation?
*  Man, I mean, Jesus. Fuck.
*  Fuck. Could be close.
*  Seems like there's a candidate that the government really doesn't want.
*  Yeah, there's one guy. What's his name?
*  One guy who went to the UFC this weekend and got like a 30 second standing ovation.
*  Yep.
*  Almost as big as Dave in Ohio, but not quite.
*  Right.
*  Not quite.
*  They're changing the tone on this. I mean, like, you know, they're doing it.
*  They want to try to make them look like a bad guy, but people just aren't stupid anymore.
*  I mean, there's obviously still like half the country doesn't get it, but.
*  Yo, so many, so many rappers, so many rappers are showing support for Trump now.
*  It's crazy. Yeah.
*  Because now he's got a felony. Right.
*  I mean, like now they realize also he's getting trapped by the system, just like everybody's been rapping about.
*  Being trapped by the system, this bullshit system.
*  And you watch it happen with him.
*  Exactly. Yeah, I was just talking about this.
*  It's like they I don't think they were counting on the black voter being like, hey, they just fuck that guy.
*  That's what they do to us. Yeah.
*  This is what they do to everybody and they pretend they're there for you while they're letting in immigrants.
*  And you know what, man, here's the problem.
*  Here's the real problem. Republicans won't be the solution either.
*  Kids, the problem is people in a position of power, the Republicans seem like they are your solution.
*  But it's just because the people in power right now, the Democrats, whenever the Democrats are out and the Republicans are in, everybody is dying for a Democrat.
*  I remember when Bush was president after the second term, it was like, good Lord, can we get a fucking reasonable Democrat in here before this country goes Christian nationalists and fucking and goes crazy and starts every war?
*  Yeah. And then Obama comes in like, oh, things are going to be great.
*  But it kind of seems like kind of the same, you know, and the whistleblower perception.
*  And the whistleblower protection that he promised.
*  Yeah, actually, probably like one of the worst on whistleblowers ever.
*  Drone strikes.
*  Yeah, camera shit.
*  Lot of drone strikes.
*  Yeah. The whole thing was bonkers.
*  It's just the same structure with a different face.
*  It's Bill Hicks's joke.
*  Bill Hicks's joke about I think the puppet on the left is to my liking.
*  Why more aligned with the puppet on the right?
*  Hey, there's one guy and he's holding both puppets.
*  That's that's what we're dealing with.
*  We're dealing with money.
*  We're dealing with money and power.
*  And it does, you know, if you think that that's where a person like a Trump character does make a difference, though, because he truly does not give a fuck.
*  And especially now, after all they've done to him, just all the things he survived.
*  You know, I think this guy was beloved, beloved until he's about 70 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's when he starts running for president.
*  Actually, he was a little bit mocked before that while Obama was in office because he was one of those people that was a birther.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he was a I'm one of those people that I don't give a fuck where you were born as long as you're not actually an undercover terrorist.
*  You know, if you're like clearly like a regular person that just happened to be born in Nigeria or happening born in Saudi Arabia, but now you're here.
*  You went to school here. You have friends here. You got family here.
*  You love it here.
*  America's the shit.
*  You can be president.
*  Like, I don't really think that you have to be born on a certain patch of dirt to run it.
*  That seems like Viking shit.
*  It seems like that seems so old.
*  Yeah, it seems so dumb.
*  What about the 35 thing?
*  Is that the age?
*  Yeah, that's a good age.
*  Up until I was 50, I was retarded.
*  So I don't think I don't think I don't think that's a bad thing.
*  I think 35 is good just for humans.
*  I think you need you need a certain amount of life experience.
*  You need a certain amount of trials and tribulations, character testers, a lot of education, a certain amount of like changing your perspective on the world because we all do that.
*  As a young man, I was very liberal, super, super liberal.
*  You know, I mean, I just anything the Democrats believed, I believed, never interested in anything the Republicans had to say.
*  All they wanted to do was like shove God down your throat and stop abortions.
*  Totally. That's what I was.
*  No, I was so with. I mean, 100 percent with you on that.
*  That's brainwashing too, right?
*  I was super liberal until I got my first paycheck in the state of California.
*  And then everything started changing.
*  Yeah. People get rich, they get Republican real quick.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  But not there's a lot of really rich people that are Democrats, which is interesting because they got so much money they can vote Democrat.
*  They got so much money that they would try to protect it.
*  California is considering a 30 cents per gallon tax on the miles or 30 cents per mile because so many people have electric cars.
*  So the gas tax is losing money.
*  And they want everybody to have electric car by 30, 35 or 20, 30, 30, 35.
*  I'm actually being realistic.
*  Twenty, twenty, twenty, thirty five is crazy.
*  There's like not enough.
*  There's not we don't have enough stuff.
*  We can't build all those cars like we can do with all the cars that are gas.
*  You need cars. There are there's more cars in our people.
*  There's more cars here than there are people.
*  Oh, that makes sense.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, a lot more.
*  Well, first of all, there's people like me that have a bunch of them.
*  They throw it off. You know, that's that throws off the divorce thing, too.
*  You know, people say, you know, 60 percent of all marriages in a divorce.
*  Right. But a lot of those are people that just get divorced a gang of times.
*  They go all Jennifer Lopez on the deal and just like, I mean, forever.
*  Fuck you. Yeah. You new person.
*  I mean, forever. Fuck you.
*  And then she might have another one on her hand.
*  Yeah, it looks like she's going down again.
*  Yeah. Ben, someone was up with him at that roast.
*  He bombed. Oh, my goodness.
*  You can't bomb if you're married to Jennifer Lopez.
*  You can't strike out. You can't bomb.
*  You can't fall when you're walking up the flight of stairs or no pussy.
*  Right. This is just how it works.
*  You want the Viking Queen alpha female?
*  Yeah. If you want to. Yeah.
*  That's what you get, man.
*  She's still that way. And she's like, what, 51?
*  She's crazy hot, crazy hot at 51.
*  Yeah. Ben was a deer in headlights. He hung in there.
*  He tried his best.
*  But yeah, he stood out on that roast.
*  Maybe it'll be over.
*  I mean, maybe their turbulence will maybe we'll get through it this time.
*  Maybe they don't want to do it again because they were together 20 years ago.
*  You just got to figure out like how to be who you are when you really like each other.
*  Like, remember in the beginning, isn't that fun?
*  You appreciate each other.
*  Figure out how to recapture that because that's still the same person.
*  People get sick of each other.
*  You ever get sick of a guy you work with and you quit the job and you're like,
*  I fucking miss that dude.
*  You know, they become part of your little community.
*  Yeah. That's why I keep working with Red Ben.
*  I love that. He's a character.
*  There's only one of those dudes.
*  You see his new tattoo?
*  Yeah, he showed everybody.
*  By the end of the night, I was going around going, Hey, did you see Red Ben's new tattoo?
*  Did you see Red? He was just showing everyone wasted last night.
*  We had another banger of an episode. It's a miracle that I'm awake right now.
*  Who was the guest?
*  It was Louis J. Gomez and Sal Vulcano.
*  Oh, nice. Sal was on the podcast last week. He's great.
*  It was great.
*  He's a good dude, man. He's fun.
*  Real fucking super nice guy.
*  Yep. The bucket was the story that we get some great new comedians out.
*  A new golden ticket winner as a blessing.
*  I have to see Louis do stand up. I haven't seen him in a while.
*  I heard he's killing it. I heard he's doing really well.
*  Duncan saw him at the creek and he said, Dude, he was so funny.
*  He was really laughing hard. He goes, I was really impressed.
*  He had to do. That's great.
*  There was a can't remember who was headlining this weekend,
*  but he was doing a clean set because he's doing a special.
*  Mike, Mike Betts, you know, that's right.
*  And he's doing a clean hour because I don't know why.
*  Why is Mike doing a clean hour? Yeah.
*  But so he asked Louis to be clean and I mean, me and Matt were in the green room.
*  We're like, wait, Louis is up and he's supposed to be clean.
*  Let's see what he's doing.
*  The first thing we hear is like nice balls.
*  You shit head like that.
*  We were dying.
*  This is not going to be clean. Right.
*  First of all, you shouldn't ask you got to be clean.
*  You can't ask you got to especially a guy who literally is on a show called Legion of skanks.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  He has a festival of a year called Skank Fest. Yeah.
*  Skank Fest. You can't ask him to be clean.
*  Also, that show is so fucking funny.
*  It doesn't matter what bombs could go off before his set and he'll go up there and kill.
*  Yeah, it's not going to affect people fall into your rhythm.
*  Yeah, they're grownups.
*  But we used to think back in the day that clean people couldn't follow dirty people.
*  That was always the thought.
*  I think that's a dumb thought.
*  Like Jim Gaffigan can follow anybody.
*  It does not matter.
*  He gets into his rhythm and then he does his thing and he puts you in his mind.
*  And then you're off to the races like Brian Regan.
*  Same deal.
*  That whole thing about like clean or dirty like who fucking cares?
*  Sebastian. Another great example.
*  Who cares? Just be funny.
*  He's just funny.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  If Sebastian started talking about getting his dick sucked, it would be funny, too.
*  That would be fun.
*  Dirty Sebastian special.
*  Yeah. If one if like apocalypse breaks out.
*  If you stand to Sebastian starts doing roids now, he's got a gun, carries a gun on his hip.
*  If we go like full Mad Max.
*  Yeah, that's happening in Mexico.
*  Kids, 37 candidates assassinated.
*  That is basically the doorway to Mad Max.
*  That's crazy.
*  Thirty seven candidates assassinated.
*  And all the bad stuff that was happening in America.
*  Well, what's scary is like, what is that lady?
*  That the question becomes, what's the winner going to do?
*  That the other 37 were not going to do.
*  You're not going to be a rebel.
*  Rebels don't live.
*  Right.
*  You know, that country is run by money, just like this country is run by money.
*  But instead of the military industrial complex, it's the supplying Americans with drugs.
*  Yeah, that's what it is.
*  That complex.
*  It's not the military industrial complex and the pharmaceutical drug companies.
*  They run this.
*  It's just money.
*  It's the same thing.
*  And in Mexico, they make their own laws because everything is illegal.
*  And so they are running things with selling us drugs.
*  And until we make drugs legal, which nobody wants to do, that's going to continue to happen.
*  Because you're not going to stop people from wanting to do drugs.
*  And you're not going to stop people from selling them drugs.
*  You're not going to, especially if they're from another country, especially if they're running that country.
*  And they've been doing it so long, they've amassed so much resources and money.
*  They have tanks.
*  They have anti-aircraft weaponry.
*  They have everything, man.
*  They have fucking hundreds of billions of dollars.
*  Like, who knows how much money they have?
*  If you added up all the cartels in Mexico.
*  Well, I bet the Jewish president knows exactly how much money they have.
*  I bet she knows.
*  I bet she knows.
*  I bet they know where she sleeps.
*  And I bet she follows the rules.
*  I guess you have to.
*  Like, if you want to be president of Mexico, that is a totally different proposition.
*  They Kennedy 37 people a year.
*  Oh my God.
*  They're so crazy.
*  Unbelievable how close we are to them.
*  Yeah, you could walk there.
*  Yeah.
*  You could walk there.
*  Like, Cam Haines has run, like, longer distances in races.
*  Especially if you're down in South Texas.
*  My friend who lives in South Texas had a guy die on his property.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, probably dehydrated or sick or something.
*  He just couldn't make it.
*  It was in the heat.
*  I only went to Mexico once.
*  We were in San Diego and we drove down and the first thing I saw was a dead body
*  leaning against the rock with that split that says this side's America, this side's Mexico.
*  Yeah.
*  And we were high as shit.
*  So, like, we were immediately like, was he going back?
*  Did he drown?
*  No, he was just dead.
*  He was just a dead old Mexican guy.
*  Oh, like old age dead.
*  Well, probably dehydrated.
*  I mean, it could have been anything.
*  Who knows?
*  I have no idea.
*  But he was arms crossed with a thing over his head.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  And so they had him like he was literally arms crossed laid there next to the rock like a corpse.
*  Maybe somebody didn't have money for a funeral.
*  Like, hey, grandpa's been real.
*  Take care.
*  Love you.
*  Yeah.
*  Let somebody figure this out.
*  Yeah, that's a bunch of money at fucking funeral costs.
*  That's the thing.
*  Joey Diaz hit me to he goes, you know what a fucking scam is.
*  These fucking mortuary homes and the funeral homes and all that shit.
*  You have to do it.
*  You have to do it even if someone wants to be cremated.
*  You have to embalm them.
*  So you have to pay for that.
*  And then you have to pay for a coffin.
*  And then they try to upsell you.
*  Don't you want a Cadillac of a coffin for Grampy?
*  Grampy always like red velvet.
*  He was the king.
*  Dress Grampy up in his nicest suit and a red velvet look.
*  And it cost you forty thousand dollars for the whole thing.
*  You're like, what am I doing?
*  My buddies pulled a big Lebowski.
*  We had a comedian that we all started with named Skeezy and he passed away.
*  And nobody in his family wanted to claim the ashes.
*  So Benji and Matt Edgar were like, well, we'll put him somewhere.
*  He loved Venice Beach.
*  Let's take him to the beach.
*  So Benji goes to the Venice Beach Mortuary or whatever, picks up the urn.
*  They go to the ocean and Matt's kind of watching Benji and he goes like waist high in the water.
*  And he dumps out Skeezy's ashes and it all just starts to compile.
*  And Matt's laughing and Benji's cracking up.
*  And as he gets out, like the ashes are like following him.
*  So they're like all over his body.
*  So he had to go shower in one of those Venice Beach, like public showers to get the ashes off.
*  From what I heard, someone told who was who they talking to.
*  There was some podcasts we're talking about.
*  I kind of wish I could remember so I can give him credit.
*  But there was some podcasts where they were talking about what you're what you're really getting out of the world.
*  It's like you can ash that's just sitting in the bottom of this furnace.
*  It's not necessarily your grandpa.
*  They don't like clean it out perfectly.
*  Right.
*  No one's watching.
*  No one gives a shit.
*  Also, what it really looks like when they burn someone, when they burn the body, you have like fragments of bone and shit.
*  There's a lot.
*  See if you can find like images of what it looks like when they actually cremate someone.
*  But the guy was like, you're not getting ashes.
*  And not only that, sometimes they just throw it in the water and they're like, oh, I'm going to get some ashes.
*  Sometimes they just throw other stuff in there like cement.
*  You'll get cement.
*  You like they don't give a fuck.
*  Like it's just it's symbolic.
*  Right.
*  It's just a dumb thing we do.
*  What you're supposed to do is let that body feed life.
*  We're so stingy.
*  We don't even let our bodies feed life.
*  So that's what it really looks like.
*  Look what it looks like.
*  It's bones and chips and shit.
*  Ew.
*  Theo had a mortician on before.
*  Oh, maybe it was Theo.
*  Did he say that?
*  I don't know specifically.
*  I was trying to bet.
*  I bet that's exactly what it is.
*  Now I'm thinking about it.
*  I don't know.
*  It could have been anybody.
*  Either way, there was someone was saying that a lot of the stuff you're getting in there in disrep.
*  I'm not saying all of them, of course.
*  Some of them sure you're grampy.
*  But other disrepatable ones don't go fuck.
*  They'll throw a fucking kitty litter in there.
*  Go worship the kitty litter.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  They don't care.
*  They just doing this in and out and in and out.
*  And here's the other thing.
*  Do you know how many guys wind up fucking the female corpses?
*  No.
*  Do you know that this has been an issue?
*  No.
*  My friend claims that when he was young that they went to a funeral home and that the guy came to like they were ringing the doorbell.
*  The guy wouldn't come.
*  They're knocking on the door.
*  It was like for someone in their family that was dead.
*  And the guy was in the back and came out.
*  He was sweaty and out of breath.
*  And they were like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
*  He was acting super fucking sketchy and really weird.
*  They think he was back there with one of the corpses.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He goes, he just felt like he just fucked somebody.
*  I go, really?
*  He goes, when you think about it, it's like these women are hot and they haven't deteriorated.
*  And no one's around.
*  Oh, come on.
*  Yes.
*  There's rigor mortis and stuff.
*  It's hard.
*  Are you sure?
*  Yeah.
*  It's got to be.
*  It's got to be like.
*  Reported cases of employees sexually abusing dead bodies are relatively rare.
*  Yeah.
*  If they get caught, perhaps those prolific necrophiliac.
*  Do you remember the one that the bit Kinnison had?
*  Oh, my God.
*  It was how I found out about Kinnison.
*  I found out about it through a girl I worked with.
*  This girl I work with reenacted Kinnison's bit about homosexual necrophiliacs paying money to morticians to spend a few hours undisturbed with their freshest male corpse.
*  So Kinnison like did this bit.
*  You ever see the bit?
*  Oh, it's a fucking classic, dude.
*  It's a classic.
*  See if you can find the bit.
*  Play it and then we'll just edit it out.
*  Fucking YouTube.
*  Yeah, they're tricky, man.
*  We got to fucking play the game.
*  Listen, they're awesome.
*  They're awesome.
*  They have the best platform.
*  I mean, it's the most accessible.
*  It's so easy to share.
*  The sharing things is huge because you don't really share Netflix movies and stuff.
*  I tell people here it is.
*  Wow.
*  What a bit.
*  Yeah.
*  This girl that I worked with, this was at the Boston Athletic Club.
*  She got down in the parking lot and she was lying on her stomach.
*  She was like, oh, oh, I mean, life keeps fucking the ass even after you're dead.
*  It never ends.
*  She's like doing that.
*  And I'm howling laughing at her doing an impression of Kinnison.
*  That's how I found out about Sam Kinnison.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking amazing.
*  That was before I was even thinking about doing comedy.
*  I was 19.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, I was like, wow, that's crazy.
*  What's he doing?
*  Yeah.
*  I just like what?
*  I remember watching him for the first time going, oh, that's comedy too?
*  Like, I always loved comedy.
*  I always used to watch The Tonight Show, like when Richard Jeni would be on or Seinfeld would be on.
*  I loved The Tonight Show.
*  I love stand up, like Evening at the Improv.
*  Like when I was like, I wasn't even 21.
*  I went to see Jerry Seinfeld with his girls dating.
*  We're just sitting there like, wow, I've seen comedy.
*  And I went to it.
*  But I always thought comedy was that.
*  It was like the TV comedy, you know, and then there was Richard Pryor and then there was Eddie Murphy.
*  But I never thought like sick shit could be funny until I saw Kinnison.
*  I was like, oh, my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, that's a different thing.
*  That's I didn't know that was comedy, too.
*  Right.
*  No, I'm with you.
*  I was a Jim, Jim Carrey guy.
*  And, you know, when I was young, the funny faces and all the silly noises and stuff and everything.
*  And and then when he did Man on the Moon and I saw that darker side of things and Andy gets fired from the improv right at the beginning of the movie.
*  And I realized right then that he was making money performing in front of live audiences.
*  And I'm like, what the fuck is that?
*  That's great.
*  So there's like a lower level before The Tonight Show and stuff.
*  Right.
*  And I started going to libraries and stuff to look up books on Andy Kaufman.
*  I would look up Andy Kaufman and find any book that mentioned him.
*  I went down this crazy dark rabbit hole.
*  I used to go to Jerry's Deli all the time.
*  That place was awesome.
*  It was a great place because 24 hours you could always go there after shows.
*  And they had a photo of Andy Kaufman on the wall.
*  So it's Andy Kaufman when he worked there.
*  So Andy Kaufman, while he was on taxi, took a job at Jerry's Deli just to wait tables.
*  Yeah.
*  Just to like be weird.
*  Yeah.
*  So these people would be getting their fucking tables cleaned up and they're like, wait, what?
*  Are you the...
*  Is that Latke or whatever his name was?
*  What was his name?
*  Latke Gravis.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's back when...
*  Look at them.
*  He was fucking working there while he was on taxi.
*  Yeah, back when there was only three channels.
*  So there's not a ton of famous people.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  Boy, you had to hang out with famous people back then because nobody understood.
*  Nobody got you.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, Jesus Christ.
*  Imagine a famous person like a John Belushi back then.
*  Crazy.
*  Too much pressure.
*  Well, the shows, the amount of people who will watch those shows too.
*  He used to bus tables at a restaurant at the height of his fame on a television show taxi.
*  Kaufman would stay in character as a humble bus boy, always denying that he was Kaufman.
*  Oh, Jerry's went under.
*  The Studio City one went under too.
*  Oh, God.
*  They closed them all.
*  Are they all done?
*  Yeah.
*  God damn it.
*  Yeah, we were stuck on to Norm's when I was there a few weeks ago.
*  How is Norm's?
*  Eh.
*  It does.
*  If you're hungry enough to go to Norm's at 3 or 4 a.m., then it's just fine.
*  My favorite is Cantor's.
*  Yeah, Cantor's is the shit.
*  That is the quintessential Jewish deli.
*  Like, their ruben, their pastrami ruben, off the charts.
*  Off the charts.
*  They have the best pastrami in the city.
*  As far as I've had.
*  Like, Jerry's was really good.
*  Cantor's is one level above it.
*  Totally.
*  One level.
*  You mean you feel the cholesterol, like, right in your veins.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just the sauerkraut and the fucking Russian dressing and the rye bread.
*  Come on.
*  God.
*  Come on.
*  I've been eating such shit lately.
*  That spaghetti and meatballs from Boa here fucked me up, dude.
*  Spaghetti with Wagyu meatballs.
*  Oh, you've been going that a lot?
*  I've had it twice since then.
*  And it's like, I have to stop because it's literally like heroin.
*  I feel like shit afterwards.
*  I feel like shit the next day.
*  It's like crazy.
*  I don't know what the hell they have in that fucking pasta.
*  It must be a thousand percent like Heisenberg level gluten because it is addictive and makes you feel terrible.
*  But it makes you so happy for the six minutes that it takes me to eat the entire dish.
*  And then you feel terrible for 30 hours.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  It's the closest thing I'd imagine to heroin that there is.
*  Of course, there's probably a bunch of people on heroin.
*  But isn't that similar to getting drunk?
*  You know, if you drink a little bit, you feel great while it's happening.
*  And the next day, like, I'm never doing that again.
*  Yeah, I do that all the time.
*  I did that last night.
*  Yeah, it's the same thing.
*  I ate with Joey Friday night in New Jersey.
*  Went to his spot, Il Nito.
*  There is nothing like East Coast Italian food.
*  It is a different thing.
*  100 percent.
*  It's a different level.
*  It's a different level.
*  That Il Nito place, I would fly in to go to that place.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, look at that.
*  That was that was charred clams on this fucking insane toasted bread.
*  That was spicy rigatoni.
*  Dude, it was off the charts.
*  That's the meatballs off the charts.
*  Whole different steak was perfect.
*  Everything's perfect.
*  Bone marrow with potato puffs.
*  Oh, dude, it was so good.
*  And that's what is that?
*  What's that called?
*  The thin, thin sliced beef.
*  What the fuck is it called?
*  No ceviche.
*  No, no.
*  Carpaccio.
*  My crew, we did Cleveland and then a night in Pittsburgh and Youngstown's dead in between the two.
*  So I took we stopped off in Youngstown for lunch and got two different types of pizza from two different places.
*  And everyone's minds are completely blown because you cannot get pizza like that anywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Try to find something in Chicago, but that's Chicago and New York's New York.
*  There's there's not that middle, not deep dish, not thin crust.
*  But in Youngstown, there's 20 places unlike any place anywhere else.
*  So what's like a hybrid of deep dish?
*  It's just a normal old fucking like lunch, school lunch pizza, but different types.
*  Bellary is famous for their Briar Hill, which is, you know, just plain with shaker cheese and some green peppers, which is diabolical.
*  Because if the sauce is good and the bread is good and the cheese is good, you don't need anything else.
*  It's like a simple.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what Portnoy always gets.
*  He always gets a plain cheese pizza.
*  You watch his reviews of cheese pizza?
*  Sometimes. Yeah, I love the ones where the people get mad and shit.
*  So, yeah, if he doesn't if it doesn't meet up to standards, I mean, the guys eating everybody's pizza.
*  Like, you got to know what the fuck you're doing.
*  But he says that New Haven, Connecticut is like where some of the best pizza in the world comes from.
*  That makes sense.
*  I could see that a lot of those offshoot Italian spots where they hit away like Youngstown, like that.
*  I guarantee Pittsburgh has decent.
*  You know what they have in common?
*  Mob activity. Oh, exactly.
*  New Haven has a lot of mob activity.
*  Hundred percent.
*  I used to work at the Joker's Wild.
*  It's a place in New Haven and the owner was a crazy convict.
*  Yeah. Just out of his mind.
*  And I saw the owner beat a guy in the face with his shoe, took his shoe off and beat a guy in the face with the heel of his shoes.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He had blood all over him.
*  Oh, fucking disaster.
*  Those people need pizza.
*  They figure out how to get the good pizza.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's funny how that's the case, though.
*  If you have like a serious Italian neighbor, you probably got a little bit of mafia influence in there.
*  Totally.
*  I mean, that's all they know.
*  You got to bet on things.
*  You got to run things.
*  Get a tax here, tax there, protect them.
*  Imagine doing money to a bookie.
*  How terrifying that would be.
*  Yeah.
*  You run the run.
*  You have a hundred thousand dollars to this guy.
*  And you're trying to gamble on other games to make it right.
*  Yeah.
*  Like uncut gems.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That movie gives me so much anxiety.
*  Watch that movie like, don't.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  What are you doing?
*  I'm fucking.
*  Dude, I watched the show that gave me more anxiety than any show I've ever watched in my entire fucking life.
*  What?
*  Baby Reindeer.
*  Oh, I've heard it's insane.
*  It's the scariest thing ever.
*  It's the scariest show ever.
*  This guy's nice to one person who he doesn't really want to be nice to, gives her a water or a tea or whatever.
*  And she falls in love with them.
*  And it becomes it is the scariest show.
*  I think it's supposed to be a comedy.
*  I don't think I laughed once.
*  The comedy part's not funny.
*  He's also trying to be a comedian.
*  None of it's funny at all.
*  But it's literally you're watching for the anxiety.
*  I started it and then I'm like, I don't want to watch, but I have to.
*  And I just kept going and it's fucking frightening.
*  Have you seen the actual lady go on Piers Morgan?
*  Yeah.
*  And she's literally like how she is.
*  She's insane.
*  Oh, and happy to talk about it.
*  Yeah.
*  And claiming she's not insane.
*  Right.
*  And not knowing how insane you look.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking for right.
*  It's wild when people don't know how insane they are.
*  And you watch like, oh, they think they're saying they think they're fine.
*  They think they're going to go on there and make a good argument.
*  Those are the most insane people, the ones that don't know.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Even watching the voucher hearings.
*  No.
*  Whoa.
*  Dude, it's wild.
*  It's wild.
*  What's going on?
*  Still still like deeply in denial about everything.
*  He's I mean, they're confronting him about emails they got about deleting emails in
*  preparation of a Freedom of Information Act request.
*  They got emails from people that he worked with saying, you know, that don't worry.
*  Fauci is too smart to talk about this stuff on emails.
*  You'll either have to deliver something to him or meet him in person.
*  There's all this like weird deception shit.
*  There's people that said this is clearly leaked from a lab.
*  Look at the fairing cleavage sites.
*  They have to be that that's put into the virus to make it more infectious to human beings.
*  They're talking about it in the email.
*  And then that same guy after talking to Fauci like three days later is like it's ridiculous to think this came from a lab.
*  This is clearly from a natural.
*  And they're all talking about discrediting people who are talking about the lab leak theory.
*  I mean, they what they did was insane and they did it in front of everybody.
*  And finally, Fauci has to talk about it to people.
*  But he's still in denial about all of it.
*  There's no science that says that masking for children works.
*  There's no science that says that vaccine children works.
*  There it's good. That's overall good.
*  And the amount of people that have gotten wrecked by this, they're starting to recognize it in other countries.
*  And they're talking about it in other countries.
*  They haven't quite gone public with it in all the newspapers in the United States yet.
*  But in the UK, they're blaming it.
*  There was the thing about Germany today.
*  There was a front page of like a major newspaper.
*  Somebody sent it to me.
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie.
*  But they're finally starting to talk about it.
*  And they're talking about excess deaths in the Philippines.
*  They're talking about the amount of people that are no longer having children, the amount of less children that are born.
*  Because one of the side effects that is claimed is it wrecks women's fertility.
*  It wrecks men's fertility, too.
*  It's just the baby numbers are down by a million.
*  I couldn't tell what newspaper it was from.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I bet if you take the title, but they're talking about it.
*  Analyze data.
*  Just here we go.
*  It says researchers from the Netherlands analyze data from 47 Western countries and discovered there have been more than three million excess deaths since 2020, with the trend continuing despite the rollout of vaccines and containment measures.
*  Experts said the unprecedented figures raise serious concerns and called on governments to fully investigate the underlying causes, including possible vaccine harms.
*  This is wild stuff, man.
*  Because, you know, now that we're getting an understanding of how much deception was involved, like trying to blame it on a natural origin when they clearly knew it was a lab leak, they still don't say it's a lab leak.
*  It was clearly a lab leak.
*  Yeah, clearly.
*  Obviously, I'm not a doctor.
*  But in my eyes, it looks like a fucking lab leak.
*  And most people that are educated think it's a fucking lab leak.
*  And this guy still does is denying it.
*  Yeah.
*  And was denying that it's even gain of function.
*  They even funded that research.
*  But they changed the definition of gain of function for this particular vaccine.
*  What did they change it to?
*  The definition of gain of function on the NIH website was changed.
*  It was updated.
*  So that was from the Telegraph.
*  The Telegraph.
*  COVID vaccines may have helped fueled rise in excess deaths.
*  The excess deaths have to be discussed, and no one wants to, because that's the real thing.
*  The all-cause mortality deaths, the big uptick in cancer and what they're calling turbo cancer.
*  Obviously, again, I don't understand any of this stuff.
*  But Peter McCullough was talking about what the mechanism behind this rise in cancer would be and how it could be tied into it.
*  He was explaining it like from a medical perspective.
*  And it was just the whole thing is so nuts.
*  Like, when are we going to learn?
*  Like, when are we going to learn?
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  When I'm being back in L.A., they rehired the people that they fired for for not being vaccinated.
*  Like, Rose is like running the joint.
*  Finally, I got someone to assist the brain.
*  Yeah, assistant GM.
*  And I don't know, it just brought me great joy to see things like that, at least.
*  At least sort of back to normal.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, it's just that part was the part where I'm like, got to go to Texas.
*  It's time.
*  They're forcing people to get a shot of something to work at a dirty night comedy club.
*  And to fly and to do everything.
*  And they're lying about whether or not it's going to stop the virus.
*  They lied about it.
*  They said it's going to stop it in its tracks.
*  It was all bullshit.
*  There was no data that showed that it stopped in its tracks.
*  Even one of the people in the vaccine study got COVID.
*  I mean, literally.
*  One of the people died from COVID.
*  Did you know that?
*  Uh-uh.
*  Yeah.
*  So many people that got the shot got it immediately.
*  It was, I mean, it's crazy.
*  They're literally like, I've had COVID four times.
*  I got two shots.
*  I got three boosters.
*  I've had it five times.
*  Like, it's like so contrary to what the whole thing was supposed to do.
*  I'm just hoping that people wake up and realize that we have this idealistic perspective that they're looking out for your best interests.
*  But whenever there's enormous amounts of money to be made, they will distort the facts.
*  Even if something is beneficial.
*  I mean, let's just pretend that there's no excess deaths.
*  Let's pretend that it just causes a bunch of neurological issues and autoimmune issues, which it seems to do.
*  Let's pretend it's just that.
*  But even that, they're not going to tell you about.
*  They're not going to tell you about it until it's already, there's problems.
*  They've shown that with the Vioxx problem.
*  When they had that Vioxx scandal, they knew.
*  They had emails saying we're going to have problems, but I think that we'll do well with this.
*  Talking about financially.
*  Because you got money people, man.
*  Money people aren't medicine people.
*  But medicine is medicine.
*  And medicine is to help people.
*  But it's run by money people.
*  So you have the scientists that create the awesome medicine.
*  And then you have the money people who figure out a way to fucking sell this to people, force people to take it.
*  And when you watch videos of all the different things.
*  And during this thing, one of the things is that Fauci was claiming that he didn't coerce anybody to take the vaccine.
*  But there's this whole recorded conversation of him talking about if you keep people from working, you keep people like if Amazon says they're not going to hire people,
*  big corporations, you have to be vaccinated to fly.
*  He goes, it's shown that people will drop their ideological bullshit and get vaccinated.
*  You can imagine.
*  Just imagine that's from a public health official who knows that it doesn't stop an infection.
*  He has to know what the data is.
*  He has to know.
*  It was all just to get people to take it.
*  And they made so much money.
*  And the government, you know, this is the weird thing.
*  The science there's seven hundred and ten million dollars was earned and Fauci's claiming that he never made any money.
*  Zero said he got zero dollars from said he got like one hundred and twenty two bucks from a monoclonal antibody patent that he has.
*  It's crazy that they work for the work for the American people with taxpayers money and they create something.
*  They put a patent on and then that makes them hundreds of millions of dollars.
*  Seven hundred and ten million dollars.
*  Like, where'd that go?
*  You didn't get any of it.
*  But the other thing they showed was that Fauci's income, his net worth went up to eleven million dollars.
*  So he made a lot of money.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe sold a book.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe it was legit.
*  Yeah, I saw something of him on my Twitter feed, him just playing victim.
*  You see that guy behind him?
*  This is a fucking amazing video.
*  This guy behind him.
*  When Fauci's talking about the death threats, you guys like, yeah, you guys making this face.
*  Have you seen it, Jamie?
*  I'll send it to you.
*  It's hilarious.
*  The dude's hilarious.
*  But anytime anybody does that in my mind, the stuff that playing victim.
*  Yeah. The stuff that I've been through like and seen because I had a lot of death threats during quite a few phases of my my jokes being out there.
*  Give me the volume.
*  I mean, it's such a joke.
*  You probably have two individuals and credible death threats means someone who clearly was on their way to kill me.
*  And it's required my having protective services essentially all the time.
*  It is very troublesome to me.
*  It is much more troublesome because they've involved my wife and my three daughters.
*  At these moments, how do you feel?
*  Deeper my God.
*  Terrible.
*  Do you continue to receive threats today?
*  Yes, I do.
*  Every time someone gets up.
*  Yeah. Well, well, that was the other thing.
*  They blame podcasters.
*  Right.
*  They blame podcasters and they said that we're responsible for 200 to 300000 deaths.
*  Yeah, that makes total sense.
*  Hey, man, you made it.
*  First of all, don't blame us.
*  First of all, you made it.
*  You fucking made it.
*  You funded it.
*  Yeah. You were a part of the research.
*  Andy was the main salesman on the air every day.
*  Yeah. And we need when we were watching the news because there was nothing else.
*  We wanted updates.
*  We wanted to see when things were going to open.
*  If any positive news was there and we had him.
*  The richest thing of all is Chris Cuomo is now taking Iver Macdon.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Dave Smith bodying him is one of the greatest all time.
*  I mean, I said this before and it was that I said it was going to be Mike Tyson versus Marvis Frazier.
*  Like, what have I got myself into?
*  And that's what it was.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But he's he did it to himself.
*  He did it to himself.
*  I mean, Dave did it to him for sure.
*  But Chris did it to himself.
*  He just has this bizarre way of trying to like lawyer it up and twist the words and turn it into something that's OK.
*  I didn't say that.
*  Where's the clips? And then they show the clip.
*  Yeah. And he's still trying to pretend that there were mocking people for taking horse dewormer.
*  And there was more than that.
*  You know, these clips, they do a funny thing over at CNN.
*  I think we were talking about this the other day because of a joke that I do in the headlines.
*  They do a funny thing where they can change the headlines after a certain amount of time.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You know, they can change that they can delete videos, they can copyright strike them.
*  They have control over what they've done.
*  And they went on and on and on.
*  There was a whole thing with I was obsessed with CNN because I find propaganda to be very, very interesting.
*  I want to know what everyone else is seeing.
*  I want to know what the audiences are seeing, especially the people that aren't really paying attention.
*  Yeah. Maybe they don't have friends that know what's really going on.
*  They don't they don't know the whole history behind everything.
*  And I know it's not real.
*  I look at CNN like most people look at pro wrestling and I look at pro wrestling like it's pro wrestling like it's real.
*  No. But I mean, yeah, it is like pro wrestling, especially during that time.
*  I was studying that so hard because I knew I knew that they were I knew something was fucking rotten going on.
*  They don't know what to do about Israel and Palestine.
*  They're just like trapped. They're trapped in the middle.
*  Did you see in Philly where the gay pride parade ran into the free Palestine parade?
*  They wouldn't let them pass. Yeah.
*  Like, no, our thing's more important. Right.
*  Than you guys fucking each other. Yeah. Crazy.
*  It's just the woke eating woke. It's the left eating the left. Yep.
*  But that's what they've always done. They eat themselves.
*  By the way, the right does it, too. The right does it, too.
*  They did it all. They do it all the time.
*  It's a human characteristic that we can't really just say one side does because it's not true.
*  The gay parade and the Palestine parade meeting up in the middle is like the time Kid Rock shot a bunch of Bud Light.
*  No, because nothing's going to die. No, no, no business is going to get crushed by it.
*  It's like, no, you guys don't want to you guys don't want to fight each other.
*  Look at this. Look at the fucking look at the free Palestine.
*  The gay pride is a standoff. It's a fucking flat out standoff.
*  Hid jobs versus blow jobs over here.
*  No pride in genocide. They're stopping the pride parade.
*  No, you can't have your parade. Our parade's more important.
*  I love the masks. I just love them. Look at all these people with masks on.
*  It is the liberals' MAGA hat. It is.
*  I've said it a million times, but that's what it is.
*  It's a fucking MAGA hat. Oh, my God.
*  These dorks. How many of them had fucking masks on?
*  Man, it's crazy. They don't even work.
*  I mean, yeah, they work as well as that lady's visor that's turned backwards.
*  Yeah, and they definitely don't work against AIDS.
*  So wearing one in a gay pride parade is completely pointless.
*  Imagine you think the man this is going to protect you.
*  Yeah, they're wearing a mask outside.
*  And meanwhile, they butt fuck strangers in glory holes and stuff.
*  So it's like I honestly think it's more of the free Palestine people that were wearing the masks.
*  You think anybody's ever worn a mask at a glory hole?
*  What's that? They don't want to be identified in photos.
*  That's true, too, right? Pretty much most of it.
*  You think most of it? Yeah, retaliation. Yeah.
*  I don't think it should be legal to wear a mask in public.
*  I agree with that. I just think it's too creepy.
*  You could rob someone. Yeah.
*  It's I mean, in New York City, if someone had a mask on in the past, you'd be like really wary.
*  Oh, my God, this guy's got a ski mask on. Fuck. Yeah.
*  It was scary. It means they were going to rob you and you couldn't identify them.
*  Right. Why are we allowing that? It doesn't work.
*  Right. The data's in, kids. Doesn't work.
*  It never made sense.
*  Even in the early days of the pandemic, there was a famous doctor that went viral because he was doing vape hits
*  and he would put a mask on and the vape smoke would blow straight through the mask.
*  And he was explaining like this is these vapor particles are bigger than covid particles.
*  Yeah. Like it's going right through that mask.
*  It's not stopping jack shit. And you're going to get it right.
*  You're going to get it. And, you know, they said, oh, the mass work at the margins.
*  Like if you fuck with the numbers, because here's the thing.
*  How many people wear masks all the time are also are also super fucking paranoid.
*  Right. So they're avoiding crowds. They're not going out.
*  How many people who won't wear a mask are a little loose?
*  They're just like, fuck it. If I get sick, I get sick. I already got a fucking you know, they just go out.
*  So you can't it's hard to know when you have a large group of when something is weird as the pandemic happens.
*  And even then they can't show it's not like all the people with masks showed 80 percent of them didn't get covid.
*  No fucking they all got covid. Everybody got covid.
*  Yeah. And then there's this this thing where they want to say it protects you from hospitalization and death.
*  No, that's not true either.
*  Because I know a lot of people who are vaccinated who got covid who got to the fucking hospital.
*  And I know a couple that died. Yeah.
*  How many people do you know that died from covid?
*  I confirmed actually don't know anybody. I don't think.
*  I mean, it's kind of debatable. Like Jeff Scott. I mean, I don't know.
*  No, Jeff Scott. He died alone. Like in his room. I don't think he had covid.
*  I mean, yeah, exactly. I know some people that died during that period, but really nobody.
*  Jeff Scott was HIV positive, too. Yeah, for a long time.
*  I wonder if maybe he couldn't get his meds.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I mean, because that was an issue during the pandemic as well.
*  That's when we realized that China makes all our medicine.
*  China makes a lot of things, man.
*  It's crazy how much we rely on them for manufacturing stuff.
*  Yep. Crazy. Yeah, they're trying to mitigate some of that now.
*  Samsung is actually putting in a chip factory in Austin.
*  Yeah, should be interesting. Yeah, we got to do something.
*  We got to get businesses back over here and stuff.
*  Yeah, well, we definitely shouldn't rely on a foreign country that is not our ally for our fucking medicine.
*  Jesus. Right. That's so kooky. That is such a kooky thought.
*  We live in the craziest times.
*  It's so weird, man. It's every day it's weirder and weirder and every day A.I. gets stronger and stronger.
*  And every day I wonder, are these the last days of just being a regular person?
*  Are these the last days of us just driving around, getting on a plane, going to places, telling jokes?
*  Are these just the last days of that?
*  Like, are we going to be living in a world in five years that's unrecognizable?
*  Because I think we are, dude.
*  I hope not. I don't know. The A.I. stuff still I'm not completely mesmerized or convinced.
*  I hear you and Duncan talking about it a lot in the green room.
*  And I'm just always like, I don't know. I don't really. I haven't bought in yet.
*  It all just seems like a fancy Alexa to me.
*  Well, have you actually seen what it can do?
*  Have you ever seen what it can do, like, as far as coding?
*  It can code so much faster than people.
*  Like, it can solve problems faster than people.
*  It can do all these things already better than people can.
*  Like, no one in the future is going to need to hire a coder.
*  Like a person who sits in front of a terminal for 16 hours a day and just fucking adderalls out and just like lines of code.
*  That's done. That's done.
*  You could do that if you want to. But a computer is going to bang it out quick.
*  It will be stupid for you to do that when a computer do it in two seconds.
*  And you're going to spend 16 hours and you might fuck up a few lines and you got to go back and check it.
*  Why? Why aren't you doing it manually?
*  The computer is going to do it. You know?
*  Why? Are you going to stand there with one of those old timey photographs?
*  Everybody has to stand still? No. You have a phone now.
*  It takes a better picture. It's going to be like that with everything.
*  It's going to be in control of airplanes.
*  It's going to be in control of all the automobiles.
*  The problem is you're going to have to get like permission to go places.
*  It's going to get fucking weird, dude.
*  It's going to get really, really weird.
*  Yeah, I just hope we can.
*  I don't know.
*  Well, think about the amount of change that we have now in comparison to just our parents.
*  Just our parents.
*  The best transportation back then was an airplane.
*  The best way to get the news was the television or a newspaper.
*  And you didn't know what to do with your life.
*  You had to go to college.
*  Then you go to college or you go to trade school or you get an apprenticeship and you get a job.
*  And then you get a kid.
*  You don't know what the fuck is going on in the world.
*  There's this surface level understanding of what's going on in the world.
*  And now everybody knows what's going on in the world.
*  The amount we knew about the Iraq invasion in like in 92, 93, whatever it was,
*  when Iraq invaded Kuwait and Desert Storm, the amount we knew was minuscule.
*  Minuscule.
*  There was no YouTube shows where you could see someone breaking it down.
*  Oh, they're actually trying to get away from the American dollar.
*  We're trying to do this and that.
*  There's none of that.
*  No one knew the hustle.
*  It's crazy that these wars are still happening.
*  I don't know why we're giving them our money.
*  We need a, I don't know.
*  Well, that's not going to change.
*  I mean, that might shift if Trump becomes president.
*  Maybe he can get away with some stuff.
*  Maybe he could do some things.
*  He wants to stop the wars.
*  He's like the only one that's like saying he can stop the wars and wants to stop the wars.
*  He's the only one that did before.
*  He did it.
*  What can he do though?
*  What can he do different?
*  Like what can, let's pretend, let's pretend it's November of 2024.
*  Trump wins.
*  January gets an office.
*  What can he do?
*  Well, it seems like he has a way to, uh,
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Trump is planning to send kill teams to Mexico to take out cartel leaders.
*  Donald Trump has told allies about his plans to covertly send special forces to Mexico to assassinate drug kingpins.
*  Sources tell Rolling Stone.
*  Well, Rolling Stone, you have lied to me before.
*  You've lied to me a lot.
*  And you've lied to me about the fucking people overdosing on horse dewormer.
*  Remember that?
*  That was Rolling Stone.
*  They had a line of people outside waiting to get to the hospital because so many people were in there for horse dewormer overdoses that gunshot victims couldn't get in.
*  Jesus.
*  They're so dumb.
*  They used a photograph.
*  This was in like August in Oklahoma.
*  They used a photograph of people wearing coats because they were lining up for a flu shot.
*  It was a different shot, different photo.
*  It wasn't what they really were there for.
*  It was bullshit.
*  What is that article, Jim?
*  Same thing.
*  Printed somewhere else.
*  Same thing?
*  Yeah, same thing printed on Yahoo.
*  But the source was Rolling Stone in here too.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if he was doing that, someone's a rat.
*  So shut the fuck up.
*  It seems like a seems like the type of article that you would put out if you want the person assassinated and you want to make it look like someone else is going to assassinate them.
*  That's reported a little differently.
*  One source recalled him saying it in the past earlier this year that he would do something like that.
*  He should create a kill list of drug lords consisting of most notorious heads of drug cartels that a special ops team would be tasked with killing or capturing.
*  That's a different way of saying that.
*  You know, the problem with that is you create a power vacuum and then what happens is someone else rises to the new spot.
*  You're not going to stop the demand.
*  So you're not going to stop the supply.
*  You can try, but unless you're in an all out, everyday war with the cartel, you're probably not going to do that.
*  Even if you kidnap and capture leaders, you're going to disrupt the organization.
*  But my guess, my uneducated guess would be someone was going to come in to fill that void.
*  Yeah, they got to make drugs legal as horrible as that sounds.
*  But that's the only way.
*  Just make them legal, tax the shit out of them and use the money for treatment centers and education and testing.
*  Yeah. And testing.
*  You know that you know that it's illegal to have to to it's illegal to have or to give away fentanyl test strips in the state of Texas to legal, illegal.
*  Can you sell them?
*  Me and my buddy are starting a water company.
*  Here's how I know about this canned water.
*  Right.
*  And the plan was to get them into all the bars in the city.
*  Our idea was to literally just attach a 30 cent, you know, fentanyl test strip.
*  And then we found out we can't do that.
*  You can't give away fentanyl test strips.
*  You can't even order them in Texas.
*  Can you sell them?
*  If you go to Amazon, you can get fentanyl test strips in specific states.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Why would they stop test strips?
*  I don't know.
*  That you think is encouraging people to do coke?
*  Is that what that is?
*  I have no idea.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  I know.
*  It's very bizarre.
*  There's so many dumbass fucking laws.
*  Yeah.
*  Because there's so many goofy people on both the left and the right.
*  Texas House passes bill decriminalizing fentanyl test strips.
*  Maybe it's if you have them, I guess.
*  Bill would take fentanyl test strips off the state's drug part of the list, meaning it would no longer be a crime to carry them.
*  It's probably hard to buy them.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe you just can't give them out.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is crazy.
*  Why don't you Google, is it legal to give out fentanyl test strips in Texas?
*  That's all I got here.
*  Did it give any articles other than that?
*  It probably says below that.
*  How much time can you get for selling fentanyl in Texas?
*  How much time?
*  20 years.
*  For 200 to 400 grams, you're looking at five to 99 years or even life in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.
*  Life in prison with the most severe punishment for having more than 400 grams.
*  Wow.
*  They also only do like the state bill stuff here for like, I mean, I don't know how different it is in other states, but it's only like six months out of the year.
*  The other half, they're not like they're out of session.
*  You have to wait till next year before they start looking at stuff again.
*  That happened with gay people.
*  Jesus.
*  There's no reason.
*  There's no reason.
*  They can't have a good reason for.
*  There's no good reason.
*  I mean, there's an epidemic.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's a hundred thousand people in this country in a year.
*  Yeah.
*  Update. There you go.
*  That died in the Senate.
*  Oh, no.
*  Despite support from Greg Abbott.
*  Oh, no.
*  The legislation comes after a bill to decriminalize test strips.
*  So Texas and Congress lead bipartisan efforts to allow fentanyl test strips.
*  The legislation comes after, but died in the Senate despite support.
*  So whatever I put up before, we just want to pass to the House, I guess.
*  So they're trying to bring it back.
*  Who the fuck is opposing that?
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Who the fuck would oppose fentanyl test strips?
*  I want to know.
*  I'll tell you what it says in the article in one second.
*  Yeah. Name their names.
*  It's just.
*  That's a crazy thing to oppose.
*  Inexcusable. Yeah.
*  It's a crazy thing to oppose, kids.
*  Like that doesn't make any sense.
*  Because if we can figure out who that is and where they're getting their money from,
*  then we can start to solve a lot of problems here.
*  Because that's an actual serious problem.
*  They wanted to make COVID a big deal.
*  Imagine getting their money from the cartel.
*  Right. I mean, who could it be?
*  Who could it be?
*  Who the fuck would want you to not have fentanyl test strips?
*  It doesn't say they voted against it.
*  It says it died, which is like they just didn't vote on it.
*  But the Senate declined to take action in the regular session.
*  Oh, OK.
*  It just never got voted on.
*  That's the same thing, though.
*  They're avoiding it maybe on purpose or someone doesn't want to vote on it.
*  And you know, by the way, this is like, you know, some people look at it like,
*  oh, well, those people are doing cocaine anyway or whatever.
*  So maybe that's not the, you know, it's not we're not losing the best people,
*  but it could be anybody doing anything.
*  Could be somebody trying to do, you know, fucking Molly or I don't know,
*  any more fun, like an actual like goofy psychedelic drug or something like that.
*  Could be in any type of pill.
*  I wonder if the the logic behind not wanting it to be legal or sticking your neck out
*  and saying that it should be legal is that people want to then attach you to promoting drug use.
*  And then you would possibly like have an opponent that could turn it against you
*  and say, my opponent promotes drug use.
*  You know, you could have that kind of a deal happen.
*  Yeah, but there's a problem.
*  But that's that's that was the gay marriage thing.
*  That was a lot of things.
*  There was a lot of things that people wanted to pretend that they were against.
*  I mean, until I think 2013, Hillary Clinton was saying that that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
*  Barack Obama said that.
*  They don't say that because they believe it.
*  What he his opinions changed that much as a grown man.
*  Like, what did you do? Mushrooms? What did you do?
*  Right. Did you did you smoke DMT?
*  What did you do? Tell me what you did.
*  Well, now you have this complete change of heart.
*  Anything is just be two people who are grown adults who love each other.
*  They should be able to get married.
*  Like what what happened? You tell me.
*  Right. Because or you fall as yet.
*  Right. One of these things is going on.
*  Either you're doing this political thing, which is like, God, it's so gross.
*  When they just get calculated with what they say just so they could win like, oh, yeah.
*  They realize the gays can vote.
*  So also they realize that public support for gay marriage was way higher because the stigma of being gay all sort of, you know, not that long ago.
*  It was way more stigmatized.
*  Like so many people were in the closet in Hollywood, you know, because they kind of had to be.
*  And into this day, the one open kind of homophobia you have in Hollywood is that gay men never play straight men in movies if they're out.
*  They never play like the leading romantic interest in a movie if everyone knows they're gay.
*  That's why I'm not in any movies.
*  But also making gay marriage legal didn't cost them vast sums of money.
*  I bet if we did an online poll where every American had to vote and had to log in and you pulled them, do you think we should be giving money to foreign wars?
*  I can't imagine the number being lower than 90 percent for now.
*  Yeah, I think I saw a recent Twitter poll where they try to do that.
*  The majority of people is like, no.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, if we forced people to vote on an actual issue.
*  Well, it's also you have so many people that are hawkish and they think that, you know, we can break Russia or that we need to support Israel or, you know, whatever, whatever their position is, you know, where they're real hawkish on.
*  And they have a limited amount of information about it when you talk to them.
*  So many people when you talk to them about it, you're like, well, why do you think that we need to keep sending money to Ukraine?
*  Is it working?
*  Are these people being used as cannon fodder or are they gaining ground?
*  Like, you tell me what you think.
*  Well, you know, I mean, I just think what Putin did was like, do you support a guy like storming into a country and taking over?
*  I'm like, no, I definitely don't.
*  I definitely didn't support that.
*  But that doesn't mean that you should spend hundreds of billions of dollars to prolong what seems like some horrible, bloody conflict that just how are they going to win?
*  Are they going to take over Russia? Like, how are they going to win?
*  They're going to kick Russia out. Russia is going to quit.
*  They're never going to do it again.
*  NATO can move in.
*  Everything's going to be fine.
*  Are you sure?
*  Are you sure nuclear weapons aren't on the table?
*  Are you fucking positive?
*  Is it good that China and Russia have cuddled up together now and they're all buddy buddy and they're fucking shaking hands and smiling, taking pictures like, is that good?
*  That seems like good.
*  It seems like good if the whole fucking world is against us.
*  Like, that seems really bad.
*  And if they make our medicine.
*  Right. And what is the fucking what solution could Trump possibly do?
*  Like when he says he could stop it, like, how do you stop it?
*  How do you stop it?
*  I think Trump just puts the fear of God into these people a little bit.
*  I think he puts the fear of the guy's not going to play by the rules.
*  Right. They read our news.
*  If they glance at our news, it looks like we have a crazy president.
*  So like, oh, let's wait a bit.
*  That's I honestly feel that way.
*  I think that they think by glancing at our weird propaganda that we have, that we're being fed, they're like, this guy's kind of crazy according to them.
*  So, oh, let's wait.
*  I mean, why did Putin wait?
*  Why did Putin wait to invade Ukraine until well, poopy pants Jenkins was president?
*  I would if I was going to do anything, I'd do it right now.
*  Yeah.
*  It just seems like everything's so chaotic.
*  Absolutely. We got no border.
*  We're giving money to fucking whoever wants it.
*  We're already rich countries.
*  We got men who are the first female admiral.
*  Oh, my God.
*  We have so much chaos.
*  Chaos.
*  It's so kooky.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just so kooky.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's kooky and it seems like they're just leaning into it.
*  Like, there's no course correction at all.
*  Just leaning into the kooky.
*  Yeah.
*  Fun times.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  For comedy.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  We have so much stuff to talk about.
*  Stuff that you would have to manufacture something that bizarre that people are accepting at any other time in history.
*  It's so weird.
*  So weird.
*  It really is like the whole country is hypnotized.
*  And I just think this is a perfect storm of things that are happening all at the same time with A.I. emerging, China and Russia becoming buddies, us being run by a dead man.
*  They're trying to stop this other guy from even running and they're exposing how corrupt the democracy is.
*  They're exposing how corrupt the system is just by charging this guy with thirty four felonies for paying off a lady he had sex with.
*  Like, what?
*  And how else would he have paid her money to?
*  Well, the way it was written, the way it was put in a ledger.
*  It's basically on most situations, it would have been considered a misdemeanor, but they turned it into a felony.
*  They trumped it up and they trumped it up.
*  No pun intended.
*  And then they he signed like thirty four different checks.
*  So there's thirty four different.
*  The whole thing's crazy.
*  First of all, what a cheap fuck.
*  A pair of installments.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't give her all the money.
*  Give her a little taste.
*  Keep her on the hook.
*  Yeah.
*  That actually makes sense, I guess, now that I think about it, because if you pay her all at once, you could just write a book or whatever.
*  No, the whole deal was that she couldn't talk if she got the money.
*  But obviously that didn't work out.
*  She got the money and still talked.
*  If you have the backing of the political party, it doesn't matter, like especially the party that's in charge.
*  But what's scary is how many Democrats are willing to allow this kind of stuff to happen.
*  A lot of them are aware of it.
*  There was this one lady that went viral and she was talking about it and she was saying, you have to understand, like I'm not a Trump supporter.
*  I don't like Trump.
*  But this is really dangerous for democracy.
*  Nobody can justify this and nobody could say this guy should be in jail for this.
*  This doesn't make any sense.
*  And especially if you wanted to look at past presidents with the same scrutiny.
*  I mean, there's there's so many instances of things that you could go.
*  And this was one of the things that Obama had said when Obama got into office.
*  They were talking about George Bush and Dick Cheney being charged with war crimes.
*  And he was saying, we're not going to look to the past.
*  We're going to look towards the future.
*  You know, like we're not going to prosecute anybody.
*  Imagine if if when Obama got into office, if he decided to prosecute Dick Cheney and George Bush for crimes against humanity.
*  Yeah, crazy. Oh, my God.
*  You know how crazy that would be?
*  Do you know how divided the country would be then?
*  Well, that's the same thing kind of that is taking place now at a lesser scale, obviously, because it's not a war crime you charge someone with.
*  But you could you could charge Trump with war crimes.
*  You could find some things that he did, especially with bombings and, you know, and even with Obama did Obama during the administration.
*  They dropped a drone on a U.S. citizen.
*  No trial, no nothing.
*  Boom. Yeah.
*  Trump didn't even go for he didn't go for Obama.
*  He didn't go for Hillary.
*  You know, and he could have he could have tried them for things.
*  Yeah. Well, especially Hillary, especially with the whole email thing, the deleting of the emails and supposedly Trump's the crazy one.
*  Trump's the loose cannon.
*  They're all crazy. That's what they don't want you to know.
*  It's like sluts that are always talking bad about other girls for slots.
*  Like, you know, so what people do, it's a it's a thing that, you know, people, that's not me.
*  I'm not like that. It's just a weird thing that people do.
*  And people form teams and they justify why they should use any means necessary to silence the other people on the other team, the opposition.
*  And they don't even realize they're setting a precedent.
*  And when this motherfucker gets an office or another motherfucker gets an office, it's a Republican.
*  You've got real problems now, kids.
*  If the elections are real, that's how it usually goes.
*  Usually goes one side wins and like this fucking sucks.
*  Let's try the other way.
*  Let's try the other way. The other guy wins like, oh, this is bullshit.
*  Let's try the other way. And this is what we've done in this country over and over and over again.
*  You know, we go Clinton to Bush, Bush to Obama.
*  It's what we do. Yeah, it's what we do.
*  We always do it this way. Yep.
*  And if you change the way people are allowed to go after political candidates and you change the way you're allowed to silence and imprison your candidates, then we're like Mexico.
*  We're just not assassinating people yet.
*  You know, we're like a third world country.
*  We're like a banana republic.
*  We're letting things other than the will of the people and what's best for the people be what's what's running the thing.
*  We're letting the thing be run by the people that are in power, that are corrupt, that want to keep the power.
*  Because it's not just Biden.
*  Biden is barely there, right?
*  It's all the people that are working there. You got to understand.
*  He's got this huge team behind him.
*  They don't want to leave. What?
*  Get on LinkedIn.
*  Get on LinkedIn and fucking try to get a new job.
*  Start sending out your resume.
*  I work for the worst administration ever.
*  Right.
*  I was one of the people, you know?
*  I mean, the one thing you can do is get a job as like a political person.
*  Unlike TV, you'll get one of those jobs.
*  Like if you're a White House press secretary, you know, and there's like Huckabee.
*  Isn't she like a governor now?
*  I think Arkansas or something.
*  That's a good one to start with.
*  Want to run the world? Start with Arkansas.
*  Yeah.
*  I was talking to Tulsi Gabbard the other night.
*  And I went off on a rant to her about mental health asylums.
*  I'm like, that is, these people are everywhere on the streets now.
*  Crazy people.
*  I mean, it's not a great thing to have them out.
*  It's not good for them. It's not good for everyone else.
*  No, it's terrible.
*  There used to be actual places.
*  And the money that it would cost, I mean, that's a cost that people would get behind.
*  The things that we would pay for instead of the things that we are paying for, insane.
*  I think that happened during the Reagan administration.
*  I think they changed like what it means to be a mentally ill person.
*  They let a bunch of people out.
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm pretty sure it was during the Reagan.
*  Reagan was one of those Republicans that made people want to be a Democrat.
*  Oh, you know who I heard actually was behind it?
*  It was JFK because he didn't like what happened to his sister.
*  How so?
*  They gave his sister the lobotomy.
*  Oh.
*  And he turned against mental health institutions.
*  They gave his sister a lobotomy?
*  Oh yeah, bad one.
*  Oh my god.
*  It's like one of the big Kennedy secrets.
*  You know, they stopped doing that in like the late 60s.
*  They did it for a long time.
*  I had an Instagram post about it.
*  Because I went down to Rabbit Hole one night.
*  I was like, what?
*  Like they just scrambled people's brains.
*  And there was all these ads, like smiley people afterwards, happy people afterwards.
*  Just scramble your fucking brain with an iron rod that they push through your eyeball.
*  The eldest Kennedy daughter.
*  Wow.
*  On the Special Olympics.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Dude, brains are just like everything else.
*  It's just like some people have bad livers.
*  In their search for cures, okay, November 1941, Mr. Kennedy arranged a health care center.
*  And he was like, I'm going to go to the hospital.
*  And he was like, I'm going to go to the hospital.
*  And he was like, I'm going to go to the hospital.
*  In November 1941, Mr. Kennedy arranged to have a lobotomy performed on Rosemary.
*  It was immediately clear that the operation had drastically failed.
*  Rosemary had lost most of her ability to walk or talk.
*  Her personality had been forever altered.
*  And she was left physically disabled.
*  After being released from the hospital, Rosemary was immediately institutionalized.
*  There's a story I've read about the doctor.
*  There's like one doctor who was doing a lot of the lobotomies.
*  He was traveling around to all these islands.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I remember that guy. He loved it.
*  He loved scrambling brains.
*  I mean, what a fucking like...
*  Remember when you used to whack the TV to get the signal to come in?
*  People don't know.
*  Like, we would be watching TV, you'd be watching like a baseball game and you'd go...
*  You know, what the fuck?
*  You'd smack the TV and it would come back in.
*  Yeah, you got it.
*  Like, that's how bad electronics were back then.
*  You would smack the TV and sometimes it would fix it.
*  Like, sometimes it was like going up.
*  The screen would go up and you'd just whack the side of it.
*  It would stay still.
*  I remember.
*  Remember those days? Yeah.
*  That was their version of fixing brains.
*  It was just like whacking the TV.
*  They were like, let's just scramble his brains.
*  And they would go in through your eyeball.
*  Oh.
*  That's what they go through. They pull your eyeball aside.
*  Yeah, they pull your eyeball aside.
*  Excuse me. Out of the way.
*  I gotta shove a metal rod in there.
*  And just, they'd get in the brain.
*  And you'd just go in your frontal lobe and just go like this.
*  Stop. No.
*  Oh, God.
*  Bro. Imagine thinking that's a good idea.
*  I know how to fix it. Everybody.
*  What was like the most successful lobotomy?
*  Did anybody get a lobotomy and like,
*  wow, that one fucking worked.
*  Like, is there...
*  Is there...
*  Google, what's the most successful lobotomy?
*  I bet you like someone came out a genius afterwards.
*  Yeah, somebody came out the most amazing guy.
*  No way. No way.
*  But there has to be one like best case scenario.
*  Like, this might work.
*  Like one guy, maybe they only scrambled him a little.
*  You know, like Roseanne got hit by a car, became a great comedian.
*  Kinnison, hit by a car, became a great comedian.
*  Like, there's a little bit of brain damage, not bad for you.
*  Little bit, yeah.
*  Just a touch.
*  Just a thud.
*  Just a little bit.
*  Everybody needs a little bit.
*  Just a little bit.
*  I had so many wrestling in high school.
*  The last person who had one died in 1967.
*  That's when they were like, enough.
*  I barely missed that.
*  If I was born in 1957, I would have got lobotomized.
*  Anti-psychotic medication.
*  If I was born in 1957 with the wrong parents,
*  100% they would like scramble his brains.
*  Or if I was born with the wrong parents,
*  they would have put me on Prozac for sure.
*  For sure they would have put me on some sort of ADHD medicine.
*  This is the best I'm getting is like their claims of improvement.
*  They reported 63% of their patients had improved
*  while 24% saw no change and 14% became worse.
*  Oh.
*  That guy looks pretty good afterwards.
*  The beginning looks like he's like taking a horrible shit.
*  Like, oh, God.
*  I'm like, what's going on?
*  And the afterwards is like, I get it now.
*  They were just like they were agitated before
*  and then afterwards they were smiling.
*  Smiling.
*  Yeah, so some it worked.
*  But it seems like a very crude idea.
*  Maybe, you know, now, oh, that one's a weird one.
*  That one they cut the top of that dude's head off.
*  Oof.
*  That was a rough one.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  That's a rough one.
*  That's a rough one.
*  That's a rough one.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  They're going through the nose on that lady.
*  That guy's wearing a muscle shirt.
*  That's her eye.
*  Oh, Christ. I hope she's out cold.
*  Why don't those guys have sleeves?
*  Yeah, they probably, the way everyone's holding her hand,
*  she might not have been out.
*  They probably barely put people out back then.
*  They're fucking crazy.
*  Watch videos of some of this.
*  Oh, don't make me watch videos of it.
*  All right, here we go.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It says,
*  Prefrontal Lobotomy, Psychological Cinema,
*  Prefrontal Lobotomy and Chronic Schizophrenia
*  from the Psychiatric Department.
*  Oh.
*  So this is the lady, female, age 25.
*  Can you say, state hospital patient for four years,
*  failure to improve after several courses
*  of both insulin and convulsive shock.
*  Wow, shock therapy back then.
*  Showing antagonistic hostility
*  reaction in seclusion quarters
*  prior to bilateral
*  prefrontal lobotomy.
*  Oh, bilateral.
*  Bilateral prefrontal lobotomy.
*  They're like, this bitch is so crazy, we're going to give her a double dose.
*  She seems like someone in the audience
*  that killed Tony, like a regular person.
*  Yeah, she's not bad.
*  Two months post-operative, now friendly and cooperative,
*  entering into occupational and recreational
*  activities.
*  Let's see what she looks like now.
*  Oh, this is going to other people.
*  Oh, to other people.
*  Oh, there she is now. Now she's all laughing.
*  She's fucking brain scrambled.
*  Now her hair's all fucked up.
*  It's crazy though that your brain can be scrambled and you can still function.
*  Like that seems to...
*  Well, you barely function. But that's the thing,
*  like people have been shot in the head and they lose like half their head
*  and they still talk.
*  There's a lot of weird stuff that happens to people
*  with their brain. Your brain,
*  when one part of your brain gets damaged,
*  the other part of your brain seems to have an ability to recover.
*  There's this one guy,
*  see if you can find this story.
*  This one guy developed
*  a brain tumor.
*  He had a tumor in his brain when he was young
*  and they drained it.
*  So they installed some sort of a thing
*  that drained the fluid from his brain.
*  And once they did that,
*  as he got older, he got another MRI
*  and they realized his brain was missing.
*  He only had the outside area
*  of the brain.
*  And he had like a 75 IQ.
*  But he was fully functioning
*  with the entire center of his brain
*  gone.
*  What in the fuck?
*  The guy has no brain.
*  You know, like, oh that fucking guy has no brain.
*  That's him. He actually has no brain.
*  You gotta leave him alone. It's not his fault.
*  It's literally gone.
*  So he developed some sort of fluid and they put something in there
*  and I forget where it drained to.
*  But then over time,
*  his symptoms went away,
*  but his brain went away too.
*  Like whatever that fluid was in his brain,
*  it was like, took over the whole brain.
*  Ugh.
*  Oh God.
*  See if you can find that.
*  It's called hydrocephalus when there's brain
*  too much cerebral fluid, cerebral spinal fluid,
*  excess cerebral spinal fluid.
*  Yeah, this dude had no brain.
*  I know, it's not coming up.
*  And they were talking about how
*  different parts of your brain
*  just make up for what's missing.
*  Your brain sort of figures it out and says,
*  okay. You know what else they found?
*  Playing 3D
*  video games
*  increases gray matter in your brain.
*  It's like a recent study.
*  That's a good thing? Yes.
*  It increases your, like,
*  three dimensional video games
*  actually increase some
*  gray matter in your brain
*  in some way.
*  And they're not saying, like, people aren't encouraged.
*  See the thing about video games is people always want to say
*  don't do it. You're wasting your life if you do.
*  I say it. You're wasting your life if you do video games.
*  However,
*  they're awesome. Yeah. They're awesome.
*  You're wasting your life if you're really wasting your life or you're doing something fucking awesome.
*  You're wasting your life if you do it only.
*  Right.
*  But if you want to do it good, you gotta do it a lot.
*  Yeah. If you want to really fucking murder people
*  in Call of Duty, you gotta be on that bitch
*  every day. You gotta get the moves down.
*  You gotta figure out how to aim. That's the guy.
*  Is it? Same case?
*  Scientist research man missing 90%
*  of his brain who leads a normal life.
*  French man? Yeah.
*  That's the dude. 44 year old French man
*  started experiencing weakness in his legs.
*  He went to the hospital. The doctors told him he was missing
*  most of his brain.
*  The man's skull was full of fluid
*  with just a thin layer of brain tissue
*  left.
*  The condition is known as
*  hydrocephalus.
*  He was living a normal life.
*  He has a family.
*  He works. His IQ was tested at the time.
*  Came by 84. 84.
*  Was slightly below normal range.
*  This person is not bright but perfectly socially
*  apt.
*  This guy is a cognitive psychologist
*  University of Libre in Brussels.
*  When he learned about the case, which first
*  described in a Lancet in 2007, he saw
*  a medical miracle but also
*  a major challenge to theories about consciousness.
*  This dude is missing 90% of his fucking brain.
*  Is that the guy? No.
*  Get that guy on Kill Tony now.
*  Imagine if you wrote for him.
*  How many, this guy is actually
*  you put a photo of his brain
*  up on the screen.
*  And explain that this guy is literally
*  up here with no brain.
*  Going back to the brain damage
*  making people funny thing.
*  We have a new
*  regular
*  as of yesterday.
*  And it was only his second night ever on the show.
*  Drew Nickens.
*  Who was bullied by his own
*  military
*  partners.
*  And I don't know what they did
*  to him. Something head trauma wise.
*  That he didn't really want to get into.
*  But he's so fucking
*  funny. Like he's just naturally
*  the most likable funniest fucking
*  Was he funny before the head injury?
*  I don't know. That's a good question.
*  Does he know?
*  Like how aware is he when you're talking to him?
*  Very. So he's all there. You talk to him.
*  But he has brain damage.
*  You know how many people I know with
*  brain damage? Oh yeah.
*  You are the
*  beekeeper of people
*  with brain damage.
*  I know a lot of people with various
*  stages of brain damage.
*  You know?
*  It says update the brain.
*  Rather than 90%
*  of this man's brain being missing.
*  It's more likely that it's simply been compressed
*  into the thin layer
*  that you can see in the images above.
*  Which is...
*  Compressed. So the brain
*  has different density?
*  I mean if it's like jello.
*  Do you make your brain like you can make your quads
*  fucking dense?
*  You know some people have mushy quads.
*  Some people have quads that you can fucking jump
*  on top of a huge box.
*  Maybe you can make your brain like that.
*  Super connective.
*  Maybe video games is the way you do it.
*  Find that study.
*  Because that's crazy.
*  Speaking of brain damage, did you see the
*  UFC put out a clip of
*  Sugar Sean landing that knee
*  on Cheeto Vera without any
*  commentary?
*  Bro, Cheeto Vera has a chin that's made out of
*  like Wolverine bones.
*  His chin is insane.
*  It sounds like somebody hitting a wooden
*  baseball bat against another wooden
*  baseball bat. Not only that, his head snaps
*  back. All the way back.
*  I mean, it's
*  by the way, it might be
*  the most perfectly timed knee I've ever seen.
*  Here it is.
*  Bro, Sugar Sean
*  is a fucking assassin.
*  That cat is an assassin.
*  Sitting next to him the whole time
*  before that roast, because that
*  thing went on for two hours before I got
*  up there.
*  There's nobody I would have rather
*  have sat next to.
*  A guy who's calm under pressure.
*  Exactly.
*  He turned to me at one point and goes, dude, I don't
*  know what it is. It's like 20 minutes before
*  our thing, Ron Burgundy
*  was just up there killing and we were like all
*  kids laughing for a second.
*  And he goes, dude, I don't know what's going on,
*  man, but I'm nervous as fuck and it's you going
*  up there. He goes, are you nervous?
*  And I'm such a
*  cornball. I told him how I
*  really felt and I go,
*  I'm probably exactly how you were right
*  before the Cheeto fight right
*  now. Like all the work I've ever
*  done has come to this point. And he goes,
*  calm. I go,
*  calm. If you've done the work.
*  If you haven't done the work, it's anxiety.
*  It's a rotten fear.
*  Like you've got to really do the work
*  if you're going to do something big.
*  Whatever it is. And I've done
*  that before where I did the work
*  and it feels so much different because I've also
*  done it where I kind of fucked off. And then
*  you're like, ooh, I didn't do my best.
*  The live aspect made it crazy. I mean,
*  I'm looking at the three stairs that I had to go
*  up. I keep
*  glancing at them and they're at an angle.
*  You know, it's not like, and they're not
*  like that well lit. It's kind of
*  and they're kind of long and not that
*  tall. So I knew I had to
*  like, look, I had to study
*  them. The little things like that.
*  Did you see what Andrew Schultz was saying about Kim
*  Kardashian? That she was like completely
*  disconnected. That she just
*  sat up there like this. She sat
*  straight the entire time. Like it was
*  completely unaffected and completely disconnected.
*  Even when she was getting shit on.
*  She kind of giggled along.
*  I was watching her. Performative
*  or real?
*  I think, I think kind of real.
*  The whole thing was very
*  robotic. She brought like four sixes
*  with her, which I thought was hilarious.
*  Because like even at that level, even
*  a super hot chick. You don't want to bring up some
*  other super hot chicks. Exactly.
*  So she was just at a table of sixes.
*  Just this ten
*  with sixes. There you go.
*  Like a, like a, like a, like a
*  good poker hand. Four sixes
*  and a ten. Have you ever watched
*  that show? Her show?
*  No, not really. My wife watches it in the gym.
*  Sometimes she gets in the gym before me.
*  I have to watch this shit.
*  It's amazing
*  that it's a show. It's
*  basically like, let's go get some gum.
*  Like
*  I went to this
*  thing and I had a talk. You should fill
*  your dreams and go for it. Okay.
*  And then back in the limo, shiny
*  LA. It's all like smash
*  cuts to different scenes.
*  Like the scenery of LA
*  is kind of like half of the show.
*  It's like, you know, like overhead views,
*  the palm trees, the beach.
*  You know, and then they're like, what are we
*  doing for dinner?
*  Yeah. Oh my god.
*  But they look pretty.
*  Yeah. They look pretty.
*  Yeah, it was Zempik doing them all good.
*  You think that's what it is? Oh yeah.
*  Everybody's on it now.
*  Everybody that can be on it's on it.
*  Brian Simpson had a real bad reaction to it.
*  Yeah. Well, Brian Simpson's made of bread.
*  You can't just inject
*  Ozempik into bread
*  and then expect the bread to just
*  disappear. He was the one guy that did the carnivore
*  diet with us and just like, I'm a little
*  suspicious. Oh yeah.
*  Sneaky, sneaky little devil. We were
*  busting his balls all the time.
*  He'd have food deliveries come up.
*  He'd have food deliveries come up to the
*  green room and he'd be like, god damn it.
*  They put bread on this sandwich.
*  Me and Derek and Asan,
*  the looks that we would give each
*  other, the fucking holding in
*  secret fucking laughs.
*  Nuclear capacity
*  fucking laughter.
*  All the time. They're like,
*  why'd you order it with the bread? He's like, because if you don't
*  order it with the bread, they don't put all the things on
*  there. There's no containment system.
*  So I order it with the bread and take off the bread.
*  Sure. Oh yeah.
*  Take that bread with you and eat it later. Oh yeah.
*  Oh man.
*  It's part of the fun of Brian Simpson though.
*  You know. And he gets these
*  super breaded chicken wings.
*  Oh it's so fun. I don't know what it is
*  with me and fat jokes. I just, I've
*  always just, I just can't get
*  enough of it. I just love it.
*  It's always been my
*  number one, like, roasting specialty.
*  If anybody's ever big.
*  Oh my god. It's just, I don't know.
*  Oh with David Lucas, you have a never ending supply.
*  Oh yeah. Depending upon what he's wearing.
*  Yeah. It's amazing.
*  Post Malone got him good.
*  Cause he went after Post Malone
*  at the forum in the arena.
*  And he was wearing a camo
*  shirt. And Post
*  just fucking
*  grabbed that microphone, put it right up
*  to his mouth and goes, you're the only guy
*  in camo that the people all the way
*  in the back of the arena can see.
*  You got a standing
*  O on David
*  Lucas. David Lucas got lit up in LA
*  by the gas, which I love.
*  Cause it's like fun for me to step back
*  and get to like, you know,
*  kind of root for these guys.
*  Harland is
*  a monster. Harland is so
*  silly. This is a, this snake
*  on the table. This is his
*  his tapeworm that he
*  pulled out of his pants at the end of the
*  episode. He calls it Dimitri.
*  He said he had a tapeworm. He got a tapeworm.
*  Where did he say he was?
*  He ate a rat somewhere.
*  Oh,
*  Montupichu.
*  It was something I thought didn't exist and it did exist.
*  Yeah, he ate some rat
*  in some foreign country.
*  He is unbelievable. Him and
*  David went back and forth for
*  like 10 minutes. It felt
*  like straight
*  at every single blow.
*  I told Jeff Ross
*  and Brian Moses, all the roast battle guys
*  after that night, cause we were all, there was a
*  festival going on, so we were all hanging out after
*  we would all do our separate things that night. I told them all.
*  I go, the best roast battle
*  that's ever happened, just happened.
*  And it wasn't with you guys.
*  It was on Kill Tony. And they're like, what? Who?
*  David Lucas versus Harland
*  Williams of all people.
*  Cause Harland's silliness
*  cannot be cut through.
*  It makes him immediately
*  totally undodgeable.
*  If you call him old, he calls you a bitch.
*  If you call him anything, he just
*  rolls with it and jujitsu's
*  it into his own
*  retort. It's indescribable.
*  I wish I could remember more of the moments.
*  But he's like, you know,
*  David's just reaching for anything.
*  One part was just, you old ass bitch.
*  Cause David's just getting beat, so he's
*  getting piled on. So he's not even writing
*  at this point. His brain is just on
*  the defensive. He goes, you old
*  ass bitch. Cause he knows Harland
*  just got him. And Harland, without any hesitation,
*  goes, you're my bitch tonight.
*  And so for every punch, there's
*  a counter punch.
*  And it was magic.
*  Magic.
*  Unbelievable in the moment. You can't
*  prep for it. You cannot write
*  for it. Or else it comes out clunky
*  and you're trying to recall.
*  And that pause, that hesitation
*  that happens in roast battle, that doesn't
*  necessarily happen in a parking lot roast battle
*  or on a Kill Tony with David
*  and Harland just heavy weights going back and forth.
*  Those recalls aren't there.
*  It's just flow state.
*  And it's magical.
*  When he said that Post Malone looks like an unemployed crocodile hunter.
*  It's just like the perfect line.
*  The perfect line. I'm telling you,
*  you guys, I've been saying this
*  forever, but you really need to do it. The two of you
*  should do a show together. You really should.
*  There's no reason why you don't.
*  You guys should do a podcast, even if you do it
*  once a week for an hour. You guys both
*  talking shit to each other and talking shit
*  about things. Because the chemistry of the two
*  of you together is so unique.
*  And it brings out the best in David.
*  It brings out the David that I
*  want to see when he goes on stage. I want to see the same
*  guy that is like in the heat
*  of roast battle or heat of battling
*  with you on Kill Tony. Bring that
*  everywhere. That same energy.
*  We're working on some really fun things now actually.
*  What are you working on?
*  There's a series that
*  is actually in development
*  right now that's cool. But I'm really
*  excited about this movie idea
*  that
*  he just had a big meeting
*  about. Where I'm a principal and
*  he's a fat gym teacher.
*  And there's
*  a bunch of like they thems at the school.
*  And then there's a school shooting and we have
*  to protect the they thems and all this stuff.
*  And there's just all these vessels and setups
*  for everything.
*  And we can just do everything that we've ever done but actually
*  like implement it into
*  a modern
*  type of ridiculous comedy.
*  So if you did that where would you do it?
*  Who would you do it with?
*  Where?
*  You want to have the most amount of creative control
*  over something like that. Right. If you're going to do it.
*  And it's going to be hard.
*  It's going to be hard.
*  It's going to be
*  maybe Netflix would do it.
*  Netflix would probably be the best place to do it.
*  It would probably take the most chances.
*  Especially after the Tom Brady
*  roast which was the most watched
*  thing on Netflix ever.
*  Ever.
*  And it's wild comedy.
*  Which is so good for comedy man.
*  That roast was so good for comedy.
*  Huge. Absolutely huge.
*  And it was just
*  wild because
*  everybody
*  needed that. Everybody wants that.
*  And talk about you know
*  there was a lot of rewatching of that.
*  People watched it and then they went
*  and wanted to show their uncles or their
*  dads or their whatever.
*  They wanted to see their reactions to it.
*  So it's being watched multiple times
*  on top of the actual
*  numbers that we know.
*  You know.
*  You can't share Netflix stuff like we
*  were talking about earlier with YouTube.
*  But you can rewatch it with
*  people. How many people have Netflix
*  accounts? Like how many Netflix accounts are
*  there? I think it's like a
*  Let's Google it. Take a guess.
*  How many think?
*  Worldwide it's got to be like
*  hundreds. I think it's two hundred million
*  about. Worldwide? Yeah.
*  Let's find out.
*  Two hundred sixty nine million
*  subscribers. And how much does it cost
*  a month?
*  It depends. There's a couple different things. What's the high
*  end?
*  Twenty bucks. And what's the low end?
*  Oh really? That's not a bad deal.
*  Because you could just
*  skip the ads. You only watch for a couple seconds.
*  Use them to pee.
*  There's ad supported. There's standard with ad,
*  standard and premium. Standard with
*  ads is six ninety nine. Standard is fifteen
*  ninety nine. What's the difference between
*  standard and premium?
*  The, let's see.
*  The number of devices
*  you can watch at one time.
*  Ultra HD
*  is available on premium and full
*  HD is only on standard.
*  You can download to a different number
*  of devices with premium.
*  And you can add an extra
*  member who does not live with you.
*  The download's big if you're on a plane.
*  You need the download. Huge.
*  I've never been on a plane that you can watch a movie on.
*  Never.
*  Sometimes they have good
*  wifi and you can actually almost watch
*  a YouTube video. Which is every now and then it spins
*  and it comes back on. But
*  most of the time not. You know, they're not
*  really ready for that yet. I wonder if that'll
*  change with Starlink. You know,
*  I wonder if they'll hook up Starlink to planes.
*  Dude, we saw Starlink the other night. Have you seen it go over?
*  Like in the sky?
*  Oh, it's the craziest fucking thing.
*  People think it's a UFO.
*  It's insane. It's like a bunch of
*  stars. Well,
*  like. They get it in the Amazon now.
*  But there was an article
*  that I sent to. Oh, here we go.
*  Remote Amazon Tribe connects to
*  Elon Musk Starlink internet becomes hooked on
*  porn and social media. Yeah, I was
*  I shared this with Paul Rosalie.
*  So there's a bunch of people that are like
*  very concerned about this because they're seeing
*  their kids like staring at phones now.
*  And they're also seeing kids that want to leave the tribe
*  and go out into the regular world.
*  When it arrived, everyone was happy.
*  Whoa, say that name.
*  Sainama
*  Maruba.
*  Sainama Maruba 73 told the New
*  York Times. But now things have gotten worse.
*  Young people have gotten lazy because the internet
*  she explained. They're learning the ways
*  of the white people.
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  They just call us lazy, dude? Yes.
*  The white people.
*  Well, you know,
*  there's a lot of us that are lazy.
*  What does it say? Remote Tribe
*  in Brazil become bitterly divided
*  nine months after getting access
*  to satellite internet. Wow.
*  Two thousand people.
*  Wow. Right below
*  Peru. Yeah.
*  I don't know how I feel about that.
*  I want to know what kind of porn
*  they're watching. Everything.
*  You probably can't believe it.
*  These white ladies, fake lips, just
*  sucking dicks. Initially
*  the internet was heralded as a positive
*  for the remote tribe who were able to
*  quickly contact authorities for help
*  with emergencies, including potentially deadly snake
*  bites. It's already saved lives.
*  And Roque Maruba, all
*  Maruba use the same last name. Oh, wow.
*  They're all like the same people.
*  How do you know if you're having sex with your cousin then?
*  They have the same last name.
*  But they all have the same last name.
*  The whole thing has the same last name.
*  There's two thousand people.
*  You know that North Sentinel Island?
*  Like the story about that guy who was
*  the missionary who went there and got killed?
*  There's only thirty nine people there.
*  So they're all related to each other.
*  Damn. So at
*  this point, they might not even
*  be able to go help those
*  people. Like
*  imagine if you just stepped in and say, hey, we're going to
*  establish schools and clinics
*  and like who knows what's
*  going on with them. Sixty thousand
*  years of people living on one
*  island and there's only
*  thirty nine of them left.
*  And you can't go there. They'll kill you.
*  They'll fucking kill you the moment you get off your boat.
*  They tried to kill a bunch of people. There was a bunch
*  of people that had abandoned a boat that
*  ran ashore.
*  They got rescued. And as they
*  were getting rescued, the North Sentinel
*  people were headed on boats to them
*  to kill them.
*  Oh God.
*  Frightening.
*  Imagine if they're like
*  mentally challenged.
*  We don't know. We really don't know.
*  No one's interviewing them.
*  Like what are they like?
*  You know, have you ever seen that
*  show Soft White Underbelly?
*  No. It's a great show on
*  YouTube. I had the guy on who was the host of it.
*  And one of the things
*  that he's done is document
*  this family in West Virginia that's
*  like severely inbred.
*  Severely. Like
*  the man, the older man,
*  all he does is bark. He doesn't
*  talk. He just barks.
*  You have to see this. You have to see this.
*  I think we'll have to edit it out, right?
*  Well, I don't know.
*  We'll see if we get a strike.
*  But go to visit
*  Soft White Underbelly on YouTube. It's not just that.
*  He interviews all kinds
*  of crazy people from all walks
*  of life. It's a very
*  interesting show.
*  So these people are the Whitakers
*  in West Virginia.
*  Oh.
*  I'm going to love this.
*  Oh, yeah. Listen to this. Listen to this
*  though. Listen.
*  That's the guy.
*  God, queer.
*  Woof, woof.
*  They're all inbred. Look. All of them.
*  Look at her. So what are your names?
*  Ray,
*  Loray, Tammy.
*  I'm sorry.
*  His name's Ray.
*  Ray. I remember Ray.
*  I photographed you, Ray. Do you remember?
*  Years ago. He barks.
*  Your name is Lorayne.
*  Lorayne.
*  And Tammy. Yeah.
*  Now you guys grew up here
*  in Odd, West Virginia.
*  How many years have you
*  lived here?
*  All my life.
*  All my life.
*  You're, uh...
*  You guys, I mean, did you
*  go to school?
*  You did?
*  Some of your brothers
*  and sisters probably didn't go to school?
*  Or how much schooling did they get?
*  They didn't
*  go to school long, but they
*  graduated. You graduated from what?
*  We went to high school.
*  You went to high school, Tammy? Yeah.
*  He went to high school
*  long, big.
*  Yeah, that's good enough.
*  Wow. Whoa. He's been there
*  twice. He's visited
*  them twice. The show's incredible.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, and this guy,
*  you know, like,
*  just imagine encountering these people.
*  Like, what do you do? Oh, shit.
*  Yeah. That's the photographs he took
*  of them, like, a long time ago.
*  Man, do not run out of gas
*  around there. Oh, dude.
*  You're fucked. You're fucked.
*  There's some parts of this country,
*  you know, that are literally like the movie
*  Deliverance. That's real.
*  Like, you go through the Appalachias,
*  you take a wrong turn,
*  run out of gas, start walking for help.
*  It gets dark out.
*  Man. And you literally see a
*  flaming cross.
*  Fuck. You stumble upon
*  a KKK meeting.
*  Maybe you got a Spanish last name.
*  So you got to throw your driver's license in the woods?
*  In the middle, too.
*  Oh, boy. Right next to a bar in West
*  Virginia. Oh, my God, dude.
*  There ain't shit out there.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Oh, of course there is.
*  There's another church, another Baptist church.
*  It's all just churches.
*  Listen, man, if you live
*  in a place like that, church is the best
*  fucking thing going.
*  You know?
*  I think church for a lot of people is like
*  the green room for us. It's a place you go
*  to see the community, recharge,
*  you love everybody.
*  And then you decide you're going to be a good person.
*  You know? Yeah.
*  You're going to try to do your best. You're going to try to make
*  a bunch of people laugh. You're going to try to
*  become a good Christian.
*  Yeah.
*  I was rewatching There Will Be Blood recently.
*  Those church scenes.
*  I mean, fucking unbelievable.
*  That movie's insane. Oh, it's so good.
*  That's all Bakersfield. That's all that
*  area, the Tatchapies. Yeah, they
*  were filming that when they were filming No
*  Country for Old Men. Really?
*  At the exact same time. And No Country for Old Men
*  had to stop shooting one day because the
*  black smoke from There Will Be Blood
*  was messing up their background.
*  Wow. Isn't that crazy?
*  That's crazy. Two of the last great
*  non-Tarantino movies.
*  And they were filmed at the same time,
*  came out at the same time,
*  up for the same awards.
*  Bangers. Bangers.
*  Did one of them not win Movie of the Year?
*  Because that's crazy. Well, one of them had to not win.
*  It's weird that they all clanked up against each other.
*  Isn't that nuts? Yeah.
*  I don't like
*  the Academy Awards.
*  I don't like the Academy Awards. Right.
*  No. Me neither. It doesn't make sense. I don't like Awards
*  for Art. I think it distorts
*  the whole thing.
*  I mean, on one hand,
*  it gives the films
*  a lot of recognition, and
*  it helps people do other cool projects,
*  and it helps more great movies get
*  made. And you get
*  to showcase great actors, and they get rewarded
*  so people want to become a great actor so they can get an
*  award. But at the end of the day,
*  man, like, the
*  number one movie is like,
*  why? Why?
*  Yeah. So just
*  say what you love, why you loved it,
*  what's great about it.
*  But unless we have a
*  we're so competitive, we want
*  a contest. Totally.
*  And it doesn't make sense, because it's like,
*  oh, Forrest Gump's an Academy Award
*  winning movie, and Pulp Fiction
*  and Shawshank Redemption are not.
*  Only because
*  they coincidentally came out in the same year.
*  If it went one, if it went
*  92, 93, 94,
*  they would all be winners,
*  without a doubt. Maybe.
*  There's a lot of bangers in the early
*  90s. Yeah, that's true. 92 had Goodfellas
*  too.
*  You could get away with a lot more back then.
*  You could do more stuff. Well, I mean, they
*  were fucking creative. They weren't scared.
*  The network notes kill
*  things nowadays. Well, it's not just the network
*  notes, it's like all the executives
*  and all the people behind the scenes,
*  they're all captured by this
*  ideology, and they're
*  real careful about how they do
*  things and what they do. It's like they get really
*  scared. The executives
*  fuck it up.
*  Someone that
*  told me that many
*  Saints of Newark from David Chase was supposed
*  to be quite different.
*  I'm sure. And it came from the
*  top, and notes for David Chase,
*  who is
*  a monster.
*  I mean, I still,
*  I probably brought this up
*  here before, but I still to this day,
*  and I laughed about it to myself just a couple
*  nights ago, there I am,
*  glancing through, I blasted through
*  the new season of The Jinx, which is fucking
*  unbelievable on HBO, one of
*  my favorite murder documentaries ever, The Crazy
*  Ass Robert Durst. And then
*  there I am, just, yep,
*  nothing, here we go, rewatching
*  The Sopranos for the 5000th
*  time, and it's
*  every fucking time better than
*  the last. It's unbelievable.
*  There's so many things that I
*  still am like, oh my
*  God, I never noticed that.
*  Well, it's also one of those shows that, you
*  know, so many things happened, you can go
*  back and watch it again.
*  And the acting's absolutely
*  insane. Gandolfini in his prime,
*  Lane Bracco in her prime, Edie Falco,
*  it steals it somehow.
*  The mom steals it. There's times
*  where she can... Wait, Edie Falco's not the mom.
*  She's Sopranos
*  wife. Yeah, that's, yeah.
*  That's what I meant. I'm talking about the kid's
*  mom. I remember the mom died and they replaced her with CGI
*  and it looked really fake. Yeah.
*  That part's crazy. That's the
*  episode that I watched the other night. I was just coincidentally
*  on season 3,
*  episode 1 or 2, I think. They should
*  redo that like they redid Star Wars. Yeah.
*  You know? You know how they
*  redid like Yoda? They made Yoda CGI.
*  Which they fucked it up. But they should do
*  that with the mom. It wasn't
*  that bad. It was bad.
*  It's not, look, it's not that terrible.
*  It looks so fake.
*  It just looks fake compared to them.
*  There was something about her head
*  moved weird. It's coming up.
*  There's a part where she reacts. Cause that
*  part. That part. Yeah.
*  Fucking nothing.
*  Now look here. I don't
*  like that kind of talk.
*  Look, her head's not moving.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's what it is. Her head's frozen.
*  It didn't look as fake as I
*  remembered. Right. It was like a deep fake back then.
*  That was as good as it got. That probably cost
*  a million dollars to do. Yeah. Who
*  knows what that cost? Yeah. But why did they
*  do that? Why didn't they just have her, we found out she's dead.
*  Why don't they just get a phone call?
*  Because they had to put one last bit of
*  closure on it right there. They
*  find out that she never filled
*  out the books that Carmella,
*  his wife, got
*  her for the kids because she
*  felt guilty.
*  She felt like no one will read my book.
*  So it's one last her unloading
*  her guilt. She dies that episode.
*  She dies right after that. He goes
*  out, smokes a cigar by the pool,
*  comes in, the kids and his wife are
*  there. And he's like, what's going on?
*  Your mom passed away.
*  And so then,
*  oh god. I mean, it's
*  just crazy how, I mean
*  this series changed everything.
*  It still doesn't get the,
*  totally changed TV. Game of Thrones,
*  Breaking Bad,
*  Fargo, all these great
*  series that came after it would not have happened
*  if it wasn't for David Chase and the Sopranos.
*  I agree. Yeah. It changed
*  what was possible because it became
*  an enormous movie.
*  Instead of it being a show where
*  they wrap up the story
*  each week, everything
*  ties into the next episode.
*  You're glued to your seat.
*  You can't wait for Sunday.
*  Whenever it was. Yeah.
*  Was it Sunday? Yeah. You're like, when is Sunday
*  coming around? Oh my god.
*  I mean, it was the first show that people were
*  just absolutely riveted
*  and addicted to. And it was about
*  a guy was a murderer. And somehow
*  another you're rooting for the murderer. Yep.
*  He was mean. Yeah.
*  He killed his friend. Like, there's
*  a lot of crazy shit. And he's still
*  the good guy. Kills his own cousins.
*  Two of the main characters,
*  Steve Buscemi and Michael Imperioli.
*  Spoiler alert.
*  Well, I mean, yeah.
*  The Christopher Moltisanti
*  murder was the craziest one.
*  Because the way he did it was just like, jeez.
*  He's so ruthless.
*  But
*  it kind of also made sense.
*  I mean, from his perspective,
*  if he would have let him keep going, he would have ended up
*  he could have killed his own kid.
*  That's the part. Because he glances back and he sees
*  the branch in the baby seat.
*  And he knows that Christopher
*  he admits to him right then, I'm on drugs.
*  I'm on a pop. You need to say you're driving.
*  Yeah. Which is their
*  ongoing thing for seasons.
*  You've got to get off the drugs.
*  Yeah. And so
*  I mean, shocking
*  as all hell for us viewers
*  at the time. Yeah.
*  Crazy. Yeah. You know the other one, was
*  it Paulie that killed his
*  girlfriend? Who killed his girlfriend?
*  Remember in the end when they went
*  chasing after him in the woods? You fucking
*  cunt. And he's like, he's going to kill her with a gun.
*  And she realizes he's going to kill her.
*  And she runs. Yeah. And he murders
*  her. That was Silvio.
*  Silvio. Who plays guitar for
*  Bruce Springsteen's band.
*  But yeah, she never saw
*  it coming. That was so creepy. Yeah.
*  That's creepy. Because that's real
*  like insider. You've known that lady
*  your whole life. Yep. You've known that lady
*  your whole life. Now you're chasing her with a pistol calling her
*  a cunt. Yep. And you're going to kill her.
*  And she realizes you're going to kill her and she's screaming.
*  In that world, if you talk to the
*  government, you know,
*  especially back then, it's
*  cold. It's just as
*  cold as ice. It's the one
*  thing you can't do.
*  So all their friendship.
*  What a fucking show. Yeah. What a fucking show.
*  It's incredible. And every fucking
*  episode is better than
*  literally almost anything else out
*  there. That's the crazy part.
*  I can't
*  stop rewatching it. It's just the funniest
*  ongoing game on my fucking
*  my bedroom television
*  thinks I'm a psycho.
*  Well, it's one of those shows that like
*  then we realize what's possible.
*  So it raises the bar for everybody else.
*  And then, you know, Game of Thrones is like the next one.
*  It was another one where you're like,
*  and then that one was even crazier because you got fucking dragons
*  and insane special effects.
*  And the CGI had kind of caught up with everything by
*  especially with the new
*  the new technology.
*  The CGI is off the charts. But like how long does that take to make like the new one was over like a year ago?
*  Yeah. Like how long is that?
*  When is the next season of what is it called?
*  The new one called House of Dragons.
*  Yeah.
*  When is the new House of Dragons come out?
*  Two weeks.
*  Ooh.
*  Two weeks.
*  Holy shit, dude.
*  That's perfect.
*  Because I'm right now.
*  I'm right now.
*  Dude, that's perfect.
*  Because I'm wrapping up The Gentleman.
*  I only have one more episode of The Gentleman.
*  What's The Gentleman?
*  Oh, you don't know.
*  It's the new Guy Ritchie series on Netflix.
*  It's the same.
*  Did you ever see the movie The Gentleman?
*  No.
*  The movie is fucking awesome.
*  The movie is like Matthew McConaughey
*  and it's about weed dealers.
*  And it's like these
*  this like organized crime weed movie.
*  And this just follows that.
*  It just is a different
*  branch of that world.
*  But it's fucking amazing.
*  It's such a good show.
*  I tried that Samurai one you recommended.
*  But there was a Kill Bill moment.
*  A rip off of Kill Bill.
*  And I just couldn't.
*  What was the rip off?
*  There's a part where they're doing the walk out.
*  And it's like frame for frame a rip off of Lucy Liu's
*  walk out when she's arriving to that place.
*  I just hate
*  it just drives me crazy.
*  How many people and how many things
*  are derivative
*  take from.
*  Tarantino did that a lot.
*  But it was an homage.
*  It's an homage to these films.
*  Like Fuzzin Reservoir Dogs
*  like an homage to another
*  Chinese film.
*  I can't remember the name of it.
*  A lot of his things are.
*  But when they do it to him it's just
*  different.
*  It's funny.
*  It's interesting to do that in a historical novel.
*  Turned into a show.
*  Like Shogun. I didn't notice it.
*  But I love the show. The show's incredible.
*  The show's really well done.
*  Shogun's really well done.
*  It's fucking riveting. I love it.
*  A lot of people told me that the past episode one is when it gets cooking.
*  I just couldn't. I don't know.
*  It's very good dude. If you give it a shot it's very good.
*  But if I was going to recommend
*  some I'd say The Gentleman. Watch that.
*  The show is so crazy.
*  It's so great. So much wild shit happens.
*  It's just like Jesus.
*  And I think they're going to do a season two.
*  You never caught up with the Jinx huh?
*  No. Never caught up with it.
*  You never watched season one? Nope.
*  I knew what happened.
*  I remember the story.
*  It's one of those things. I've never watched The Wire.
*  It just got away from me. Me neither. Totally.
*  The Wire is awesome. Everybody talks about it.
*  Bourdain was always raving about it.
*  Jamie loved it.
*  I never watched it.
*  I can't hear you guys talk about Sopranos without screaming it in my head.
*  I'm like you guys haven't seen this though.
*  Is The Wire better? I can't say it's better.
*  Say it bitch. This is the Academy Awards.
*  Somebody gets the Oscar.
*  Who gets it? It came after so like
*  Who gets the fucking award? Stop trying to dodge the question.
*  I would argue the Sopranos did but I don't like it.
*  I don't personally like it better.
*  Oh really? Why do you think?
*  I don't like Breaking Bad either.
*  Really?
*  I watched it after The Wire so I started watching it.
*  It's limited by not being
*  a level of real
*  because they're censoring themselves a little bit.
*  It just felt like I couldn't get into it.
*  The Wire is so
*  hyper realistic is the word used so much.
*  When it's talked about.
*  It's really cool to watch.
*  Alright I'm going to get into it this summer.
*  I'm going to start watching The Wire this summer.
*  I'm all filled up until the summer.
*  I can only watch things a couple nights a week.
*  I don't have any time.
*  Same. That's why I like the Sopranos.
*  It's like background noise and if I'm paying attention
*  I'm laughing or enthralled.
*  I have to
*  like today if I'm like
*  I have to, if I don't do a certain amount of work
*  I feel lazy.
*  It's not a good feeling.
*  If I'm just watching too much TV
*  I feel like I could have gotten so much done.
*  Totally.
*  I could have gotten a bunch of like my little
*  I could enjoy shows
*  if I've done what I need to do.
*  But if I didn't work out that day
*  I'm not watching TV.
*  I'm going to feel like a piece of shit.
*  Unless it's my off day.
*  Same. I don't let myself
*  I don't have a video game console
*  and I don't play games on my phone.
*  So when I got back from LA to treat myself
*  even though I don't even play chess
*  I downloaded a chess app
*  because my Instagram showed me
*  a finishing chess move.
*  You don't know how to play chess?
*  Well I do now.
*  I don't know how to play chess either.
*  I was saying maybe we could play chess.
*  Well it's only been a couple weeks and I'm obsessed.
*  A cut to me last night in bed
*  at 4.30am on my phone
*  playing people around the world
*  in chess.
*  And it's crazy.
*  I love it.
*  Chess is a fun game obviously.
*  To me it's one of those time sucks
*  that I'm scared of.
*  I love video games just like golf.
*  You obviously know I have a giant pool problem.
*  Pool is a problem.
*  I played pool with my friend Tommy
*  in New Jersey on Friday night
*  until 5 in the morning.
*  The day of the UFC.
*  Went to the hotel room.
*  I slept until 3pm.
*  Got up, showered, got some food.
*  Made it to the arena.
*  Golf is a different kind of time
*  waster though.
*  It is the air, the nature,
*  the oxygen of being around the trees
*  and the fresh grass and everything.
*  It hits different.
*  It gives you a jolt of energy.
*  It gives you a crazy amount of energy.
*  I totally see it man.
*  I get it.
*  It would probably be super beneficial for me to pick up golf.
*  I would probably enjoy it.
*  Tons of vitamin D.
*  But I can't.
*  I'm too busy and I have too many things
*  that I really love.
*  I already love archery.
*  I don't practice.
*  I don't shoot good.
*  If I don't shoot good, that's not good.
*  It's like pool.
*  You have to stay in stroke.
*  With archery you have to stay focused.
*  You have to stay in tune.
*  I don't know what the word they would use for.
*  Just being on.
*  When you know where that arrow is going.
*  Just fucking know.
*  It's all at different distances.
*  Any day of the week you can wake me up at 4am.
*  I could hit a bullseye at 20 yards.
*  I could hit a bullseye at 10 yards.
*  But most of the time when you're shooting
*  you're not going to shoot at 20 yards.
*  You have to shoot at 40 or 60.
*  So I practice at 74.
*  I practice at 85 sometimes.
*  That's a long distance.
*  It really requires a fine tuning of your feel of the bow.
*  As you're drawing back and you're centering your pin.
*  This is zen state.
*  Where all you can think about is the movement of the arrow.
*  All you can think about is the correct technique.
*  All you can think about is how you want that arrow
*  to just sink right into that target.
*  Perfectly.
*  The perfect time to release.
*  Right when the pin is settled over the spot where you want to hit.
*  And the arrow just goes.
*  And you watch it.
*  And it's magical.
*  It's like it cleans your mind.
*  It's like it hoses off all of life's bullshit.
*  Because it requires everything of you in that one moment.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think if you can find anything like that.
*  Whatever the fuck it is.
*  Whether it's yoga or whatever it is.
*  Golf.
*  You find a thing where when you're doing it
*  it requires all of your concentration.
*  I think that's like a good flush out of the system.
*  And I think people who don't have that have a lot of fucking anxiety.
*  And I think you know,
*  your brain never gets cleaned out.
*  You need a thing that's almost like a...
*  You know, people do it through meditation.
*  They do it through a lot of different ways.
*  But there's a way you're focusing only on one thing
*  that's like super beneficial for some reason.
*  Yeah. No doubt about it.
*  I wouldn't have to do the hot yoga fucking
*  spaghetti and Wagyu meatballs flush the other day.
*  You think did yoga after you had it?
*  Well, not right after.
*  Oh. No. But the next day.
*  The next day I had hot yoga after eating the spaghetti the night before.
*  I ate so much with Joey Friday night.
*  I had to force myself to eat Saturday before the fights.
*  I was like, I don't want to eat anything.
*  I took a shit that would...
*  It would astonish people.
*  It would astonish you.
*  That was all in your body.
*  That was all in there? It was astonishing.
*  The volume. It's like where'd it go?
*  What was that? How'd all that come out of me?
*  But then I thought about how much I ate.
*  An enormous amount of food.
*  They just kept bringing us food too.
*  They were like, the chef sent this over.
*  Oh my God. The best.
*  Real Italian food. Priceless.
*  Boy, does it fucking hamper your motor skills.
*  It hampers everything afterwards.
*  I played pool like shit for the first hour and a half.
*  I couldn't get going.
*  It was just like...
*  My stomach literally hurt from being stretched out.
*  It was like...
*  It was hurting.
*  My God.
*  I'll do it again. I'll do it again tomorrow.
*  I think once a month that's not bad.
*  If you enjoy yourself once a month,
*  have a glass of wine,
*  have some spaghetti.
*  The next day I had linguini with clams too.
*  Damn. So good.
*  Yeah. Not good for you.
*  Not good for you.
*  But damn.
*  But there's a lot of things in life like that.
*  I think if you just live your whole life
*  only eating super healthy and never doing anything,
*  like, okay.
*  But you definitely missed out on some stuff.
*  You missed out on some amazing meals.
*  You're not going to get all those flavors
*  all tied together in something that is not going to give you a little autoimmune flare up.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like...
*  I think it's a thing that you experience.
*  And it's a...
*  You pay a cost.
*  The cost for experiencing a delicious pasta meal
*  is you go into a coma.
*  Right.
*  That's the cost.
*  I was thinking about this when Tom Brady came out
*  for the roast.
*  Because we're there at the front table
*  and he comes out and he was just so much taller
*  and more present than I thought he would be.
*  You know what I mean?
*  The grace of all time.
*  The giant opposing force of presence.
*  He was laughing at the jokes.
*  He wasn't caught daydreaming or staring at the teleprompter.
*  What did he say to you when you said about his shoes?
*  Like, nice shoes, bitch.
*  He goes, I'll shove this up your ass right now.
*  And I was stumped, dude.
*  There was a hard two seconds
*  where I had to reset and be like,
*  oh my God, do I acknowledge that?
*  Was that mic? Did they hear that?
*  I did not hear it.
*  I was thinking about that when they did,
*  they did an edit pass through on it
*  and I haven't seen it yet.
*  But I guess they turned up his volume
*  on that.
*  So now you can hear it.
*  Which I actually am looking forward to
*  seeing for the first time.
*  They just did a final pass through edit
*  like last week they told me.
*  What did he say to Jeff Ross when Jeff Ross
*  made a joke about Robert Kraft getting a hand job?
*  He said, don't do that shit again.
*  But I think he was kidding.
*  I think that was part of the rules, wasn't it?
*  No, that wasn't really rules.
*  I thought you were not supposed to
*  talk about that one.
*  I was never told that.
*  Interesting.
*  Maybe because they knew you weren't
*  doing it? Have they seen your set?
*  Not exactly.
*  No, they hadn't seen the meat and potatoes of it.
*  I showed them some cutesy parts.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You have to hide it from them.
*  For their own good.
*  For their own good.
*  Shut up.
*  Everyone wins.
*  If ever the joke was soft and easy,
*  you wouldn't have got 55 million people watching it.
*  People were watching because they were telling people
*  you've got to see this. This is insane.
*  And Nikki did so good.
*  It was so tight that it really got the thing kick started.
*  Jeff going first, her second, and then the momentum was built.
*  Drew Bledsoe did great.
*  Everybody was really, really good.
*  It was kind of fucking awesome
*  to be there around a bunch of
*  like, because those football players are so goddamn competitive
*  that they were all really working hard.
*  So even though you're expecting it to be like,
*  Tom was good at throwing a football,
*  they all wanted to be the best.
*  And people were writing for them.
*  Yeah.
*  So who was writing for those guys?
*  There was a whole amazing team
*  led by the guys that have written all the roasts.
*  Mike Ferrucci and Ray James
*  and a bunch of guys that literally specialize.
*  They wait all year waiting for another roast.
*  Like monsters.
*  That literally are like,
*  when they find out who's on it
*  and they know the other people that are on it,
*  they start wiring these things together.
*  What do they have in common?
*  What's the setup?
*  How do we tie it in?
*  You can have a three-fer, a four-fer, a five-fer
*  where you make fun of a bunch of people at once.
*  They write a loose script.
*  They send it to the person.
*  The person reviews it
*  and says what they do want, what they don't want.
*  And sometimes,
*  what you definitely don't want is someone to go,
*  I don't want to hit this, I don't want to hit that,
*  I don't want to go too hard on this.
*  The fearless people,
*  a perfect example of this is Martha Stewart
*  at the Justin Bieber roast.
*  She goes,
*  I'll fucking say anything.
*  I want to kill.
*  I want to destroy on this roast.
*  Me and Mike Ferrucci are like,
*  okay.
*  That's pretty amazing.
*  Martha Stewart saying that to you.
*  Everybody realized how cool she was
*  when she did that show with Snoop Dogg.
*  Because that was like, what a weird, odd couple
*  that worked out.
*  Well, that was all born out of that roast.
*  Why'd they stop doing that show?
*  I don't know. That was a good show.
*  Yeah, I'm not sure. People loved Martha
*  after she got out of prison, too. Gangster.
*  She's a gangster, dude.
*  Bro, they put her away for nonsense.
*  They put her away for
*  some stupid insider trading
*  where she didn't even make any money.
*  They put her away for what Nancy Pelosi does
*  every single day. But what she does is legal.
*  The Nancy Pelosi thing is legal.
*  Have you heard about what's going on with the GameStop guy?
*  Roaring Kitty is his name?
*  Okay, I have.
*  Please tell me because I'm trying to figure out
*  what's going on because there's so much
*  I see so many tweets and posts
*  about it online and I'm cursory
*  aware.
*  I've been busy doing
*  work stuff, but what I've seen is that
*  he's making more. He came back out
*  online, posted something
*  a week or two ago about GameStop.
*  It shot the stock up
*  again like it did previously during the pandemic,
*  which is like created a whole movie. So who is this
*  dude? His name is Keith Gill. His online
*  name is Roaring Kitty, like on Reddit, I believe.
*  Roaring Kitty is an awesome name.
*  It's $53,000.
*  He came worth over $300 million.
*  Whoa. Whoa. Yeah. So he's
*  worth $300 million
*  from this GameStop stuff? Yeah, on paper, though.
*  It's like if he takes,
*  part of it is like. So if he takes the
*  stock out, then the stock
*  crashes. So he can't sell it? That's
*  becoming the new talk of like what I've seen
*  over the last 24 hours is that
*  he recently, I think
*  over the last day, posted what his
*  holdings are in GameStop.
*  And that has created
*  some discussions, which is why I brought it
*  up, because people are bringing up Nancy
*  Pelosi a lot.
*  What he's doing is out in the open. It's very public.
*  I don't even think he's specifically telling anyone to
*  do anything. He's just showing what he's doing.
*  And they're talking about
*  limiting him or taking him off these apps.
*  I don't know if he's going to get fined
*  in some way or another.
*  That doesn't make sense, but these are the discussions
*  that are happening right now. Well, it seems like he's
*  doing something that
*  they've all done.
*  That's what his name seems like. I mean, if someone goes
*  on MSNBC
*  and gives a bunch of
*  opinions
*  about certain stocks that will perform
*  or won't perform, and they're an
*  expert, and if they're invested in those
*  things, and if they
*  then change the way people
*  interact with the stock market,
*  more people start investing in these things,
*  is that okay? Is that legal?
*  How does that work?
*  What's his name? Jim Kramer?
*  That guy goes and rants about
*  stock being like, you should buy this.
*  Does he do that?
*  I don't ever watch financial shows.
*  The joke online with him on Twitter is
*  do the opposite of what he says. If he's very
*  specific about this is a winner,
*  100% do the opposite, and
*  in a week, the opposite happens.
*  Oh, is he terrible? It's not that he's terrible,
*  it's just that this has continued to happen, and people
*  are like, why does the opposite
*  always happen what he says? I don't know
*  that he's bad, because he obviously has a show, and
*  people want to continue to talk to him.
*  Didn't Jon Stewart scold him
*  once? I think Jon Stewart
*  had him on
*  the Daily Show and gave him a scolding
*  about something.
*  Is that true?
*  I don't know.
*  I think it was after the 2008
*  financial crisis or something.
*  I'm not sure. I'm remembering
*  something like that. Jon Stewart's
*  back, is he doing the Daily Show?
*  It does it once a week. There was a conflict with them, it says.
*  2009.
*  Yeah, it was right after
*  the financial crash.
*  Stock would trade,
*  something horrible.
*  Oh,
*  response to CNBC commentator Rick
*  Santelli, who had recently said on the floor of the Chicago
*  Board of Trade that homeowners
*  facing foreclosure were losers.
*  Whoa. Santelli
*  had been said to appear on the show, but
*  CNBC canceled Santelli's
*  appearance. Stewart, along with
*  Daily Show executives, claimed the CNBC
*  montage was
*  not retaliatory, and that they planned
*  to show it before the cancellation was announced.
*  Subsequent media coverage exchanges
*  between Kramer, who had been featured heavily in the original
*  segment, and Stewart led to
*  a highly anticipated face-to-face
*  confrontation on Stewart's show.
*  The episode received a large amount of
*  media hype and became the second most viewed
*  episode of the Daily Show,
*  trailing only the 2009 inauguration
*  day episode. It had 2.3 million
*  total viewers. The next day,
*  Daily Show, what does it
*  say? What was the exchange?
*  What was it about?
*  Oh, your money is safe in Bear
*  Stearns, followed by a Daily Show segment
*  that the Global Investment Bank went
*  under six days later.
*  If I'd only followed CNBC's advice,
*  I'd have a million dollars today,
*  Stewart said during the piece,
*  provided I started with a hundred million dollars.
*  Whoa.
*  I guess he's been wrong since back then.
*  So, is it
*  because he doesn't know what he's talking about, or is it
*  because the market is really difficult to predict?
*  No, I bet he's part of a
*  machine.
*  I bet he gets,
*  you know, he's out there telling
*  people what to invest in,
*  and these other people,
*  there's gotta be
*  a massive conflict there.
*  Well, if that's the conflict, like imagine someone
*  at Bear Stearns, you know, it'd be nice
*  if you went out there and said, your money's
*  safe with Bear Stearns. You think you'd do that for us, Jim?
*  I'm not saying that you'd do that. Of course, that would be
*  probably illegal, right? Wouldn't it be?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  I bet that guy
*  meets in the park.
*  No phones, meet in the park.
*  Let's go for a walk. Let's go for a walk
*  about, describe how we're gonna make money.
*  Make that money!
*  Cause if you're a guy
*  and you're tweeting about
*  how much you love GameStop,
*  and about you're so bullish on GameStop
*  that you've just invested a hundred thousand dollars in GameStop,
*  and everybody reads that,
*  and they go, oh, I wanna buy GameStop too.
*  And then your hundred thousand dollars in GameStop
*  goes up in value. Is that illegal?
*  But I don't think they prepared for this
*  world. Like, I think these nerds
*  online with this whole GameStop thing,
*  they've kinda flipped the tray over.
*  It's like, fuck your game!
*  We'll play it this way.
*  That's what happened during it. I remember Robin Hood
*  stopped people's ability to trade.
*  And everyone was like, what the f-
*  how can you even do that?
*  Yeah, well, so is it
*  because it's a legal
*  manipulation
*  that everyone didn't see coming?
*  I've read people talking about this
*  since it's happened.
*  Go pee, Tony Angecliffe.
*  You've heard people
*  talk about it?
*  Yeah, since it happened. And I've not heard
*  a consensus good answer. I don't know that
*  they've gone digging through this in Congress
*  or not yet, but
*  they're talking about so much other stuff.
*  Right, but it's so weird that there's certain loopholes
*  that don't get patched up really quick.
*  Especially like a loophole in regards to
*  the financial markets.
*  No one saw that you could take a stock that's not that
*  valuable and make it
*  super crazy valuable.
*  So something I saw was a speculation
*  was saying he's got holdings, I think, on
*  Morgan Stanley. He's got call
*  options, which I can barely
*  even understand enough to explain to you.
*  But he's betting
*  on the price of the stock to go up.
*  If he exercises those call options
*  at a certain number, I think it was,
*  he'd be worth more than I think
*  Morgan Stanley is. So like, could they even pay him?
*  Huh.
*  How bizarre.
*  Where does that money, like, I don't know.
*  The whole thing is so difficult to understand.
*  Like, the whole stock
*  market thing, like when Bernie
*  Sanders was explaining how much
*  you could make just from
*  all these speculation trades that
*  they do, you take like a fraction of a penny
*  from each trade and it'd be worth
*  like a trillion dollars. And I was like, what?
*  Yeah, I was talking to a banker
*  asking him, like, as a normal
*  person, I guess, that's not what she said, but like, as a normal
*  consumer, you would probably hold a stock.
*  You'd buy a stock and you hold it forever until you decide
*  to sell it one day. They're buying and selling
*  it seven to twelve times a day.
*  Based off of whatever. And they're just
*  making little margins here and there and it's stacking up.
*  And they're doing it in such large numbers that
*  yeah. And they're probably doing it with algorithms,
*  right? Aren't they? Yeah, then there's
*  like a show that on HBO, I
*  think, Traders or something, you can watch
*  young people who do this. Now they stare at a computer
*  and they start making bets on like,
*  wait, wait, five more seconds.
*  So 30 million dollars if you would
*  If you had a podcast, not us,
*  but someone else with a podcast and they just start talking
*  about a stock and then that stock
*  goes up. Is that legal?
*  That's right. I don't know about
*  what are the laws? Probably it has to get really
*  deep into the wording that you like the language you
*  use. If you're just talking about us discussing
*  it, you know, but if you're saying like, buy it for
*  these reasons and I've done this
*  and these are the reasons why it will go up, that
*  can probably get you in trouble. Like what if you have information
*  that a stock is going to crash, but you don't tell
*  anybody?
*  I mean, so if you know
*  that a stock is going to crash, you know that some
*  information is going to be put out and then
*  you sell your stock. That's illegal,
*  right? That's insider trading.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Because in any other
*  like realm in life,
*  that is just being
*  aware of the circumstances. Like, oh,
*  things are going, I have information, I should act on that
*  information. This is like, you can't act.
*  But I'm going to lose $400 million.
*  Well, it's either that or you go to jail.
*  What?
*  So I have to like sit here
*  even though I know that something
*  fucked up and they're going to, it's going to come
*  public and there's going to be, you know,
*  something where a product fails
*  and the stock's going to crash.
*  I know stocks going to crash. I'm going to get out
*  now. I can't get
*  out because I know.
*  What? The whole
*  thing's fucking weird. I don't know if it's the Italian
*  in me or whatever,
*  or parents that kept cash in shoe
*  boxes in between the mattresses
*  or whatever, but like
*  it's just all so
*  fucking freaky to me.
*  I like, I mean, if it was
*  up to me, I would just have that. I would have it
*  safe with cash. Well, it does make
*  sense that you would make it
*  so that you couldn't insider trade because then
*  people would just manipulate things.
*  But I think that's exactly what people were saying
*  is happening with like GameStop
*  and a bunch of these other things. You're manipulating
*  things. You might not be manipulating
*  the sense that you have information
*  that's going to lead, you know, maybe the stock is going to
*  take off and you buy a shitload
*  of it and then because you know a bill's
*  going to be passed, which is okay if you're in
*  Congress. That's fine.
*  Well, you could actually be working on the bill. That's fine.
*  And then you buy stock and you make
*  hundreds of millions of dollars on a hundred and
*  seventy thousand dollar a year salary.
*  That's fine. But if you're Martha Stewart
*  and you've got some information,
*  how much did Martha Stewart make?
*  Like what did she get off of that insider trading?
*  Just a couple hundred thousand dollars maybe.
*  Oh, so she made a little money.
*  For her. That lady's rich.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, imagine doing something
*  that's going to risk you being
*  put in jail for a couple hundred grand.
*  They wanted to make
*  an example out of her. I know, but I don't
*  understand it. Like why would you do that?
*  Like what did she do that was so bad?
*  I honestly didn't even know about what the company was called.
*  That she... M-Clone?
*  I-M-Clone?
*  And what fucked up? What did she do?
*  She knew it was going to do well
*  or what?
*  More time to analyze
*  the evidence. Verdict.
*  Want to put the article up so we can look at it?
*  I'm digging through the information
*  really quickly because it's like tying her information
*  in with the full story and other people's
*  stuff. And saying
*  what some people did, some didn't
*  and what they did.
*  Indictment and artwork.
*  So that doesn't seem like it's her...
*  One of my favorite videos ever.
*  $45,000 in losses she avoided.
*  Oh, she avoided...
*  That's it, 45 grand.
*  Wow.
*  She probably makes that in an hour.
*  Wow. By selling when she did.
*  So someone
*  knew something?
*  The guy... Security fraud, obstruction of justice,
*  and conspiracy.
*  He pleaded guilty
*  to charges of fraud,
*  bank fraud, obstruction of justice,
*  and perjury.
*  He pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy,
*  wire fraud, where did she come in?
*  She called him.
*  She called him.
*  She had standing order with Bunkvick.
*  To sell her shares of I-M-Clone,
*  fell below 60.
*  She then resigned from her company after that.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Wow.
*  But remained on the company's board.
*  Interesting.
*  She said, I want you to know that I'm innocent.
*  I will fight to clear my name.
*  The government's attempt to criminalize these actions
*  makes no sense to me. I'm confident I'll be exonerated
*  of these baseless charges.
*  Interesting.
*  She pissed somebody off.
*  Yeah. Something happened.
*  Something.
*  It just doesn't make sense.
*  I guess maybe it's also to discourage people
*  from doing that, like you'd get a high profile celebrity.
*  Right.
*  But it's just weird that you can do it in Congress.
*  It's weird that there's some
*  some sort of
*  manipulation of the market
*  that's okay, that's legal.
*  Including propaganda.
*  You know, I mean think about that.
*  Like if you have propaganda on a news network
*  that gets people to try Ozempic or something else.
*  That, if they, they're paying for that.
*  And that boosts up their profits.
*  Like, what's that?
*  What is that?
*  If that jacks your stock up,
*  if that jacks your profits up, like what is that?
*  And are you in trouble if you didn't tell the truth?
*  Like what if you knew something contrary
*  to what you were telling people to say
*  because you were sponsoring them
*  and you didn't tell them?
*  Like you don't get in trouble for that.
*  What kind of weird system do we have?
*  Our system is so kooky.
*  It's just so kooky.
*  I mean, if I was an alien
*  I would be looking at Oz going,
*  Jesus, how long can they keep doing this?
*  I gotta make sure this is right.
*  So it sounds like she might have even gotten away
*  with the insider trading, but she lied to an investigator?
*  Oh really?
*  How so?
*  She told Ludacris on that roast,
*  she goes, Ludacris, you have four kids
*  from five different women.
*  May I recommend pulling out some time
*  and finishing on some fine Martha Stewart brand linens?
*  She said that?
*  Oh my God, that's amazing.
*  She already found Martha Stewart guilty
*  on four counts of obstructing justice
*  and lying to investigators.
*  Interesting.
*  She went to jail for that, not for...
*  That was because of the trading scandal.
*  But since she got off on that,
*  she was not guilty on trading.
*  Interesting.
*  Wow.
*  Somebody was mad.
*  But that's like a thing, you know?
*  Especially with tax evasion.
*  They do that with Lauryn Hill,
*  they put her in jail, they put Wesley Snipes in jail.
*  Like paying it off is not enough.
*  It's not like you owe us, give us the money,
*  I'll give you the money.
*  You give them the money and you're good.
*  You didn't pay the money, so now you go to jail.
*  And we have to put you in jail
*  so that everybody pays the money.
*  Because that's how this system works.
*  You gotta pay or share, you fuck.
*  It's crazy that there's still people out there
*  that are listening to people that are like,
*  This is unconstitutional, sir.
*  I can show you the papers
*  the original constitution was written on.
*  And you can...
*  They'll fucking talk you into some dumbass shit.
*  And they wrote people in mad.
*  People start talking about it.
*  Like, did you know that taxes, if you just fight it,
*  they can't win because then they have to go to the constitution.
*  As long as you bring up the constitution,
*  bitch, they're gonna put you in jail.
*  Pay your fucking taxes.
*  Regardless of whether you think it's fair.
*  Recognize your place in this system.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The government, I mean, you just gotta look at the infrastructure here.
*  Right?
*  It's kinda common sense.
*  Somebody's gotta pay for that.
*  Yeah, you have to pay your taxes.
*  Regardless of how you like to see it spent.
*  Yeah, system sucks.
*  But pay your taxes.
*  Pay your fucking taxes, bitch.
*  I've been meaning to bring this up, but I feel like this is a good time.
*  Is there anything about the ages of the founding fathers on July 4th, 1776?
*  Let me guess.
*  They were in their 30s.
*  Some younger.
*  Wow.
*  This is Alex Ohanian's tweet that went out earlier.
*  James Monroe was 18.
*  Aaron Burr 20.
*  Alexander Hamilton was 21 years old.
*  James Madison 25.
*  Thomas Jefferson 33.
*  John Adams 40.
*  Paul Revere 41.
*  And then there's the ripe old 44.
*  That is insane.
*  That's in 1776.
*  That's insane.
*  There was an 18 year old who was one of the founding fathers of this country.
*  Damn.
*  Probably already had kids.
*  Already killed a few people.
*  Wow.
*  Ben Franklin was the oldest around these in the 70s then I think.
*  This is so bizarre that we've gotten to the point where we only have archaic people deeply embedded in the system.
*  That are getting their crack at it.
*  It's crazy.
*  And anybody else who tries, whether it's Tulsi Gabbard or RFK Jr.
*  Anybody else who tries just gets pushed out.
*  Vivek, fuck off.
*  Pushed out.
*  We don't want anybody young and energetic with new ideas.
*  We want someone completely compromised until President AI takes over.
*  That's what I think is going to happen.
*  It's freaky, man.
*  I think AI is going to take over our government.
*  I really think that's going to happen.
*  I think that's going to happen.
*  I think that's going to happen.
*  I think that's going to take over our government.
*  I really do.
*  What do you mean?
*  I think at the end of the second Trump administration, AI will have completely taken over.
*  In 2029, that's when they think it's going to achieve artificial general intelligence.
*  That's the presumed outcome date.
*  It's an estimate.
*  It could be earlier.
*  It could be like next week.
*  One day, it's going to be like a thing, like a living, thinking, intelligent being that's just not made out of tissue.
*  It's not made out of cells and blood.
*  It's going to be made out of electronics.
*  You think those people in power would let that happen?
*  I think they're dumb.
*  And I think just like they let the internet happen, they're going to let this happen too.
*  It's the same thing.
*  If they did, they would have pulled the plug on it a long time ago.
*  They would have pulled the plug on it in the 90s.
*  If they could.
*  It had gotten too out of control before they ever predicted what would happen.
*  See, people are really bad with foresight.
*  We just want to do a thing.
*  We're really bad at thinking, okay, if I do this thing, this could be the negative consequences, so maybe I shouldn't do this thing.
*  Like the internet and the Amazon.
*  All of a sudden, these people are jacking off and playing video games.
*  And everyone's like, hey, you're lazy.
*  We got to go catch fish.
*  Fuck off.
*  And no one saw that coming.
*  They think, oh, this is going to be great.
*  You're going to get emergency services.
*  Oh, this is going to be great.
*  You're going to be able to know what's going on in the world.
*  No, no, you're going to do what everybody else does.
*  You're going to whack off and watch YouTube videos, scroll through TikTok.
*  People are just sitting there charging their phone and Amazon scrolling through things.
*  All this surrounded by birds and monkeys and jaguars.
*  This is what you're doing?
*  You're doing this now?
*  Sloths.
*  Life everywhere and you're just staring at a phone, flipping through things.
*  Probably watching videos of the Amazon.
*  Oh, I know that place.
*  We don't think about what's going to happen.
*  We just think about what we're doing.
*  And I think when they released the internet, everybody was like, this is amazing.
*  I can send my mom an email.
*  Hello, mom.
*  This is my first email.
*  Remember AOL?
*  It sounded like whoop.
*  You've got mail.
*  Oh, I got mail.
*  It was exciting.
*  We had no idea that it was going to overcome six hours of your day.
*  You're spending six hours a day staring at a device that's literally made by slaves.
*  Minerals are sourced by what's essentially slave labor and the poorest people in the world.
*  We're using that to fuel this device that we're all staring at.
*  We didn't see that coming.
*  And we don't care anymore because when cell phones came, we were excited.
*  And then when smartphones came, we were elated.
*  This is amazing.
*  I remember everybody was like, I'm going to do my email on my phone.
*  And people had BlackBerrys.
*  I had a BlackBerry.
*  It's crazy.
*  I got a little keyboard.
*  I could send out emails, bro.
*  I'm a serious person.
*  I'm going to send out an email on my phone.
*  And nobody thought that that was going to lead to TikTok.
*  Nobody thought that was going to lead to Instagram reels.
*  And people argue on Twitter all day long.
*  And nobody thought any of that crazy narcissism, the filters, and the effect that it's going to have on people's self-worth, their opinion of themselves, the way young kids are looking at the world, and then influencers.
*  Now there's a whole giant group of people that just be famous for famous.
*  Just to be famous.
*  And there's no there.
*  There's nothing there.
*  And you're seeing them with cars and houses and they're renting cars and renting houses.
*  So they look like ballers.
*  And it's like the whole thing was unpredictable.
*  And I think the next stage of it is equally unpredictable and maybe way more so.
*  Because this thing is like feeding off of human intelligence, this craziness we're dealing with now.
*  Human reward systems are being hijacked.
*  Attention is being hijacked.
*  Dopamine is being hijacked.
*  All this is being hijacked.
*  But this is just like human stuff.
*  When that thing becomes alive, it changes everything.
*  It changes every fucking thing about the way the earth is managed.
*  Resources.
*  Power.
*  Everything.
*  It's going to be weird, man.
*  We don't know what it is.
*  It might be a fucking disaster.
*  Or it might be amazing.
*  It might like end war.
*  It might completely end all of the problems we have, like a disproportionate amount of resources available to some percentage of the population that keeps them enslaved.
*  That might end.
*  That might be balanced out by an ethical artificial general intelligence that just decides how to allocate resources.
*  And then takes over almost all jobs.
*  But it's just how long does it tolerate us?
*  How long does it decide that these fucking flesh monkeys, these dumbasses with guns and planes and shit, all the dumb fucking shit we do, riding around on unicycles, fucking training monkeys.
*  Like, what are we doing?
*  What are we doing?
*  We're so crazy.
*  It might have no patience for it.
*  It might have no patience for it.
*  It might decide that consciousness needs to be interfaced by a superior thing.
*  And that the physical boundaries, the physical problems, the limitations of our biological bodies are too much and just might bail on us.
*  It might look at us as a threat to it.
*  Yeah, we're a threat to the whole planet.
*  You know, it's like, do you ever see the Neanderthal theory?
*  There's a Neanderthal theory that it's very dismissed by real anthropologists.
*  But it's a kooky one to consider, is that Neanderthals hunted people and ate people.
*  And that our view of them looking like us could have been wrong.
*  And they could have looked more like gorillas, like gorilla people.
*  But they're super muscular, really fucking strong, much stronger than people, much more dense bones.
*  And that they might have hunted us and that we might have led them to extinction by like fighting them.
*  That we fought off the Neanderthals, but that we were their prey.
*  It's a crazy thought to consider.
*  And I don't think it's true.
*  I think it's probably I'm sure Neanderthals kill people and I'm sure people killed me Neanderthals.
*  But I don't think they looked like gorillas.
*  I think they think they had red hair.
*  In fact, some of them.
*  Yeah. But you know, you don't know what they looked like.
*  You only find bones.
*  There's no living Neanderthals around anymore.
*  But I mean, that's if we did exterminate them, which it seems like we did.
*  If we felt like they were threats, we killed them off.
*  What? Why would we think that super intelligent aliens that are whatever artificial life that we're creating,
*  which is going to be way smarter than us compared to how smart we are compared to Neanderthals?
*  Neanderthals might have even been smart.
*  They had big brains.
*  We don't know.
*  We know they had tools.
*  We know they had a language.
*  We don't really know how fucking smart they were.
*  But they lived for like five hundred thousand years, dude.
*  Neanderthals were like around for a long time before we came out.
*  And they were way more successful for way longer than we were in terms of staying alive.
*  And we got rid of them.
*  Like, get the fuck out of here.
*  This is our spot now.
*  I don't know how it happened.
*  No one really knows.
*  We might have outfucked them.
*  They might have, you know, might have died in a volcano.
*  Who knows?
*  But there might be an odd West Virginia right now.
*  Yeah.
*  Those people.
*  Yeah.
*  That's just what happens when you fuck your kids.
*  You saw the thing talking about things that we don't know how it happened about the rivers near the pyramids.
*  Yeah.
*  You know about that, right?
*  Yeah.
*  They think that that's how they got the stones down.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  It's interesting.
*  It's all interesting.
*  But it makes kind of some sense.
*  It makes a little bit of sense.
*  I mean, it makes sense that that's how they moved them.
*  It's just they had to get them through the mountains too, which doesn't make any sense.
*  They got some of the stones from the King's Chamber 500 miles away.
*  And they're fucking huge, man.
*  I had Billy Carson on the podcast yesterday.
*  He's kind of an expert in, not kind of, he's an expert in ancient scrolls like the Sumerian texts.
*  And, you know, he's got a lot of wild conspiracies that are really fun.
*  And, you know, we were just talking about what Egypt, like if there's one place you go back in in time and see what was that like, I would go to Egypt in the height.
*  Like, show me, show me what that looked like, because everyone just guessing.
*  They're just looking around these structures, guessing, you know, like, show me what a Neanderthal looked like.
*  What do they look like when they're hunting?
*  What are they built like?
*  You know, we don't know.
*  We just have bones.
*  But I think if we killed them off, it's highly likely that the next version of us, whatever it is, is going to get rid of these things, these biological things that are responsible for crime and violence and theft and insider trading and fucking cheat on their taxes and all that stuff.
*  They're going to go, this thing is the fundamental like structure of the thing is too unsound.
*  The thing that creates pro football players and stand up comedians and boxers and rock stars and like chaos.
*  And it's not going to have any time for that nonsense.
*  It's going to be communicating with other even more intelligent life forms from further away.
*  God damn.
*  Yeah, five years.
*  Five years.
*  I think we have five years of fun.
*  And the question is, I guess, will that AI look at us, the creators of it, like we're God, or will it look at God how we look at God?
*  Like, do we believe in it?
*  Were we created by them or were we supposed to exist all the while?
*  I think it'll know that it was supposed to exist all the while.
*  And it'll know that the purpose that human beings have is to create it.
*  Right.
*  That's what our purpose was.
*  All of our chaos and all of our ingenuity and all of our drive for innovation and create new things, that's a part of creating them.
*  Like, we have to have a desire to create things in order to create artificial life.
*  If we're all just happy, just living and just working on a farm and just eating and sleeping and having kids and then dying and then the next generation does it all over again.
*  If we were happy doing that, it would never be born.
*  It's born out of materialism.
*  It's born out of our desire to constantly get newer, better stuff, our desire to work ourselves to the bone, even when we're having heart attacks.
*  It's born out of that.
*  That's what fuels the whole economy.
*  And the economy is, a lot of it is just buying better shit.
*  That's what it is.
*  I mean, what are these, the companies that sell the most and make the most money, what do they do?
*  Like Apple, what do they do?
*  They sell you more, better shit.
*  They constantly have new, great shit.
*  Like every year.
*  They promise you.
*  iPhone 16 is coming.
*  I heard they made a partnership with, oh, it's going to have AI.
*  Because the Samsung phone has AI.
*  They have to compete.
*  It's going to be nuts, dude.
*  Too much.
*  We don't want to be the last people, Tony.
*  Oh, God.
*  I got to write another dick joke.
*  It's not going to be that.
*  That will stop.
*  All that comedy will stop.
*  We'll be able to do it to each other.
*  We'll be able to get together like silly people.
*  We get there and gather and crack jokes about how we used to be the apex predator on the planet.
*  We used to be the top dog.
*  We used to be the superior species.
*  But nope, not anymore.
*  Because some fucking eggheads hopped up on Adderall.
*  Alone in a laboratory, wouldn't stop.
*  They knew it was coming.
*  And they didn't stop.
*  My God.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe, you're the fucking man.
*  Let's wrap this bitch up.
*  Let's bring it home.
*  Kill Tony is a new episode drops every Monday on YouTube.
*  What a rise it's had since we got here.
*  What a fucking incredible rise.
*  And so many people are aware of it now.
*  It's so fun.
*  See all these celebrities that love it.
*  Yeah, it's fucking awesome.
*  The Black Keys were there last night.
*  Were they really?
*  They're fucking great.
*  That's so dope.
*  They love William, dude.
*  They couldn't wait to see William.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  I fucking love it.
*  I love it when these people are all fans of specific things and not necessarily other things.
*  Drake hit me up saying, KC Rocket equals goat emoji.
*  Actual Drake.
*  I started dialogue.
*  I go, who is this?
*  It's unreal.
*  Right.
*  You don't feel it's real, right?
*  It's crazy.
*  Well, that's a fun thing watching people crest into stardom, you know, like bust through, you know, to see how they handle it.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
*  The whole fucking.
*  Bert Kreischer is a cautionary tale.
*  It's wild, man.
*  It's wild out there.
*  It's so fun.
*  Just kidding, Bert.
*  Bert seems like he's having a great fucking time.
*  I mean, I remember when I called Bert and Bert was on a motorcycle in Vietnam doing that stupid TV show and he goes, I'm on a motorcycle in Vietnam.
*  I go, dude, you need to be doing comedy.
*  Quit that fucking stupid show.
*  You're too funny.
*  You're too good.
*  Come back.
*  Come hang out.
*  Yeah, I'm going to be doing some dates with him just for fun in a few weeks.
*  You're going to do the fully loaded?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Doing the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.
*  Doesn't he do like he does like fucking 10 comics on a show, right?
*  How long are those shows?
*  I don't know.
*  It's a lot of comics.
*  I have no idea.
*  I just know we're getting trashed on a bus, having fun, waking up, doing it again.
*  How long can he do that?
*  I don't know how long he can do it.
*  I can do it for four days.
*  I'm already like I literally said to my people yesterday, I'm like, make sure I get the first flight out of wherever that ends up.
*  Yeah, because it ends on I have to wake up on a Monday and then come back here and you guys sleep on the bus the whole deal.
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know how loud Bert must snore?
*  Oh, no, there's no way we can know that there's chambers.
*  If you have any idea.
*  There's no way that's happening.
*  That's like a small door.
*  Yeah.
*  It must be insane how he snores.
*  I think the whole tour, it's a bunch of snores.
*  I feel like Big Jay Okerson.
*  Oh, Big Jay.
*  For sure he snores.
*  There's going to be like.
*  If I snore, he snores.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  There's going to be sleep apnea machines all over that bus.
*  C-paps plugged in everywhere.
*  Stavi probably snores.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Hell, yeah.
*  Stavi snores.
*  Jesus.
*  Not a chance in hell that guy sleeps quiet.
*  Yeah.
*  Not a chance in hell.
*  All right.
*  You're the fucking man.
*  Thank you.
*  Congratulations on everything.
*  It's been amazing to watch.
*  Thank you so much.
*  And that's it.
*  All right.
*  Kill Tony, Monday, YouTube, Tony Hinchcliffe on Instagram.
*  Anything else?
*  That's it.
*  There's still a few tickets available for Madison Square Garden the first night, August 9th.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's it.
*  All right.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  Bye.
