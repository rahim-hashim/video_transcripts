# Joe Rogan Experience #1480 - Kevin Hart
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 25, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzx6h2sAGTU)
*  You come in here moving and shaking, man.
*  You come in here making deals, you're on the phone already.
*  Gotta do it, Joe.
*  You're always moving.
*  I mean, is there anything else to do?
*  Is there anything else to do besides moving?
*  Now I just wanna get ahead.
*  No, no, especially not now, man.
*  Hunters hunt.
*  Yes.
*  Those that don't get ate.
*  The last time you were here, man,
*  that was one of the most inspirational podcasts
*  I've ever done.
*  I left that, I literally had a shift
*  in the way I was looking at things.
*  Like you put an extra gear in my step that day.
*  I was like, oh, I love being around people like you.
*  My guy.
*  People around you, people like you,
*  you're going for shit all the time.
*  And it's infectious.
*  It's like you give off energy.
*  And when people around you, they wanna get shit done too.
*  They wanna hustle.
*  It's contagious.
*  Yes.
*  It's contagious.
*  It's not just me putting it out.
*  I think that the last time I was here,
*  our conversation was such a great conversation
*  because there was,
*  we both had point of views, right?
*  And when we shared the point of views,
*  you elevated the other person's POV.
*  Like when we were talking and I was telling you
*  why I live the way I live, why I am the way I am,
*  you springboarded.
*  Then you said, yeah, because Kev, for me,
*  I've been doing this.
*  And we had this yin and yang thing going
*  and it drove the conversation.
*  I told you, before we jumped on,
*  one of the best interviews that I've ever done
*  and from a feedback perspective
*  with people that just loved what the discussion was,
*  loved the tone of the interview, the things that were said,
*  felt inspired, motivated after.
*  It was just great all around for me.
*  Checked all the boxes.
*  It was for me too.
*  And I got a bunch of great responses from my friends.
*  That's when I know it's good when I get friends
*  and my friends are all like pretty unanimous.
*  They're like, that is a motivational motherfucker.
*  Wow.
*  Like that dude gets shit done.
*  When people hear stuff like you,
*  like someone who's excited about life,
*  excited about doing things,
*  there's something about that that it's fuel.
*  It's fuel for, we need that.
*  Everyone needs that.
*  You know, I don't even, this is not a cheesy segue.
*  All right, this just makes sense from what you just said.
*  What you just said is the reason why I did the decision.
*  You said people need that it's fuel.
*  Yes. Right?
*  I feel that in today's time,
*  what people are most selfish with is information.
*  Nobody wants to give information.
*  You gotta ask for it.
*  If you ask for it, then all right, maybe.
*  Maybe I'll tell you some stuff, but it's a search and find.
*  You mean real good information.
*  Real information.
*  Information about how to get to success.
*  That's the want from everybody across the board.
*  On some level, okay, everybody's success is different.
*  This doesn't mean fame and stars.
*  I'm not talking about that level of success for everything.
*  I'm saying whatever your version of success is to get to it,
*  information from someone that's done it
*  or that's partaken in it in some degree
*  will only add to the value of your journey.
*  It's only gonna make it easier.
*  It's not to say that you gotta do what they said,
*  but with that information, you're able to process it.
*  Maybe use it, maybe not.
*  Right.
*  I got it.
*  Right.
*  That's what I wanted to do.
*  I said, yo, I got a fucking, I got a life.
*  I got a hell of a life that I've lived full of ups, downs,
*  potholes, cobblestones, speed bumps, flat road, U-turns,
*  some smack brick walls that I ran into,
*  some revolving doors of back and forth.
*  And through it all, my mental has only gotten better
*  because I feel like I've been in a mental gym,
*  a mental fitness that coincides with life.
*  It should get better.
*  You should get wiser.
*  You should get smarter.
*  You should be able to make better decisions.
*  And all of my decisions came from
*  the massive amount of fuck ups,
*  and I can now share those fuck ups.
*  I can now share the rights and the wrongs
*  and the way that I handle all of the things that I've done.
*  And people can just take that information and go,
*  wow, I never looked at it like that.
*  But it gives them a better view of the landscape.
*  Especially when someone like you,
*  you almost seem like an unattainable person.
*  Like how does he do that?
*  How is he doing that?
*  How does this guy go from Philadelphia
*  to be one of the biggest movie stars in the world?
*  How does he become one of the biggest
*  stand up comedy stars ever?
*  How the fuck do you do that?
*  You almost seem like an alien to people on the outside,
*  but then when they hear you talk about your real life
*  and talk about these fuck ups,
*  talk about these successes and talk about the lessons
*  that you've learned, man, that's fuel for folks
*  in a way that nothing else is
*  because there's a lot of people that are bullshit online.
*  There's a lot of these motivational speakers
*  that haven't done shit.
*  And it's a weird thing.
*  It's like they're trying to give you motivation
*  by sort of reciting things that they think are gonna work.
*  That they think you wanna hear.
*  They haven't done anything.
*  But someone who's done something,
*  when you say it, people are gonna listen.
*  They're gonna go, oh, and you're so honest about everything.
*  Which is, that's everything to people
*  because when you're pure, when your words are pure,
*  people take them right in.
*  They come right in.
*  There's no like, oh, this guy's kinda fuckin'
*  sellin' me somethin'.
*  Oh, this guy's kinda bullshit.
*  I'm not sellin' shit.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I got nothin' to sell.
*  I had a talk with Chase, like JPMorgan Chase,
*  a partner of mine, and we were doing this,
*  well, not we were, we are.
*  We're doing this thing called Advancing Black Pathways,
*  right, where we're trying to cure financial literacy
*  in the black community.
*  We're on like year number two right now, right?
*  And there was a conversation where they wanted to
*  have said bankers go and talk to the kids in the inner city.
*  And I was like, you can't send a white man
*  that works for JPMorgan Chase to the inner city
*  of said community, hood, whatever,
*  to talk to these young black kids
*  that has no idea about the life that the black kids are livin'.
*  I said, what you need is people that have actually come
*  from these environments, they have made it out
*  of the environments, and now understand how money works.
*  Because now when I talk to you,
*  I'm not talking to you with hypotheticals,
*  and I'm not preaching to you about what you should do
*  and what you gotta do.
*  I said, I'm telling you what I did that didn't work.
*  I'm telling you how I fucked off money,
*  and I'm telling you what I didn't know.
*  Hey guys, here's a fact.
*  There is no education that comes with money
*  in the black communities, it doesn't.
*  You can go search for it, there isn't one,
*  it does not exist.
*  There is no one that is outright teaching the kids
*  in the black community how to operate financially,
*  how to set up for your future.
*  There is nobody talking to you about ownership,
*  homes, mortgages, investments, stocks, that doesn't exist.
*  It doesn't exist.
*  It's not until you get out of that environment
*  that you meet some people that are planning
*  their life accordingly that you start to ask questions.
*  It's not until maybe college and on the later side of it
*  that you're with people that are getting jobs
*  in the future that you start to do it.
*  There is no prep or education at a young age.
*  I said, so you need a fucking man that can go there
*  and go, hey man, let me tell you why y'all gotta stop
*  taking these free credit cards.
*  Let me tell you why you gotta stop putting a cable
*  in somebody else's name and continuing to fuck it up.
*  Let me tell you why you gotta stop being okay
*  with not having a bank account.
*  Let me tell you why you gotta stop
*  using the check cash places.
*  There's nobody giving that information.
*  I said, that's what I am.
*  So if we're gonna have a relationship,
*  let's build it off of something authentic.
*  Let's build it off of something that people can go,
*  I get that.
*  Since then, to go back to your point,
*  my relationship has been based on me telling the truth.
*  I told JP Morgan Chase, I wanna go to the inner city
*  and I wanna have these discussions,
*  but let me have them my way.
*  I don't wanna have it in a JP Morgan Chase way.
*  And I gotta credit them for backing me
*  because they aligned me with other people
*  that share the same stories,
*  that have achieved certain levels of success,
*  that speak to the same thing.
*  So everything that I've done,
*  everything that I'm trying to do,
*  when I do talk about it, I come proven.
*  I'm only talking about this
*  because I really got knowledge about it.
*  I don't got knowledge about it
*  because I'm the smartest motherfucking word.
*  That's not what the knowledge is coming from, Joe.
*  My knowledge is coming from,
*  hey man, yo, don't walk through door number one.
*  I walked through that door.
*  There's a monster in there.
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of shit in that door.
*  It wasn't until I came out that door
*  that I saw those monsters that I knew
*  the other monsters weren't as bad in door number two.
*  But door number three is finally where you should go.
*  I messed up, man.
*  I went to the first two doors wrong.
*  Why can't I give that to somebody
*  that hasn't experienced those doors yet?
*  Why can't I just give that information
*  and possibly prevent them from walking into those doors?
*  And that's what's really valuable for people listening.
*  Yeah, man.
*  That's what's really valuable.
*  Yes. Someone who's actually done it
*  and done it wrong and done it right.
*  And like, hey, listen, I fucked up.
*  This is how I fucked up.
*  That means so much to people.
*  You're advancing people's possibilities.
*  I think that's what life should be about.
*  Yes.
*  As adults, as adults, we have a job to do.
*  Whether you want to admit it or not,
*  your job is to set up the next generation.
*  That's our job.
*  Whether you want to fucking admit it or not,
*  it's your kids, it's your friends, it's whomever.
*  You're supposed to live a certain way,
*  do certain things to set up for the next generation to come
*  and to be able to do better.
*  If you don't, then you're not doing your part.
*  And if the world never fucking grows,
*  you gotta raise your hand and be responsible.
*  Cause you're a part of the lag.
*  Yeah.
*  You're part of the delay.
*  If we look up in 15, 20 years and we're in the same spot,
*  what that means that our fucking ground breakers
*  that was doing all the shit during that 15, 20 years,
*  never shared the information so that these new people
*  come through and break new ground.
*  Yeah.
*  Somebody gotta do more than what the fuck I did.
*  I don't care who it is.
*  Right.
*  But you gotta do more.
*  Right.
*  Somebody gotta fucking do more.
*  Somebody gotta break these records.
*  You already belayed the trail.
*  Yeah, that's all I did.
*  All I did was show you, hey man, hey, they stopped here,
*  but I kept going to the left and I started hauling ass
*  and look what I found.
*  Now that I'm over here, that means there's more.
*  Did you have a time in your life where you realized
*  that you were doing the right thing?
*  Like a time in your life where you realized,
*  like in your comedy career in particular,
*  where you realized like, I'm getting some fucking traction.
*  Like this is really rolling.
*  Like in the beginning, you're probably like all of us
*  were not sure what was gonna happen.
*  You're trying, you know, you're doing open mics,
*  you're trying to make it.
*  But was there a time where you're like,
*  this approach is, this is happening.
*  I've got traction.
*  It was when, I think the noticing of, oh shit,
*  oh something's happening right now.
*  And this is, I think this is success.
*  I think I'm in it.
*  Was it around the time of your first special?
*  Like when was it?
*  It was when I did the Shaq All-Star Comedy Jam.
*  I just told somebody this story.
*  I was talking to Gary Owens actually,
*  good friend of mine, comedian.
*  And we were talking about the past.
*  And you know, Gary was like, Kev,
*  there was a moment where you just fucking,
*  just ran past everyone.
*  And he was like, I don't remember exactly
*  what it was that did it.
*  He said, I just remember looking up and you were gone.
*  And I remember it was the Shaq All-Star Comedy Jam.
*  The lineup was Cedric the Entertainer, he was hosting.
*  It was DeRay Davis, Tommy Davison.
*  And myself.
*  That's a hell of a lineup.
*  It was DeRay Davison, Tommy Davison, myself.
*  Cedric the Entertainer was the host.
*  And I closed out the show.
*  And I remember going to do the show.
*  It was in Phoenix, it was in the round.
*  And I had to do, this is when I was about to tape
*  Seriously Funny, my next special,
*  I have to grow a little man.
*  So Seriously Funny, I was taping like four months.
*  It was already on the books.
*  So this is supposed to be it.
*  This is my big coming out party.
*  This has to be it, man.
*  You know, I feel like I'm ready.
*  I've been working hard.
*  My jokes are hitting.
*  I'm raw, I'm edgy.
*  This is it, this is the one.
*  I'm fucking funny, seriously.
*  That's why I titled that.
*  Seriously Funny, I was ready.
*  I get the call from Jeff Klanigan.
*  Shaq's All-Star Comedy Jam, we're taping it Kev.
*  Dude, it's like 15, 20 minutes.
*  You know, can you do it for me?
*  And Jeff and I had a relationship.
*  And I was like, Jeff, I'm about to tape my special.
*  I don't wanna burn that material.
*  He's like, Kev, look, you can use some other stuff.
*  15, 20 minutes, we tape it.
*  But you know, these things get some good traction,
*  good views, some good eye candy.
*  You should just have it out there.
*  All right, whatever.
*  I wasn't even taking this serious.
*  This was not something that I was taking serious.
*  And this is an example of sometimes you don't know
*  what it's going to be.
*  You don't know what the fuel in the rocket is going to be.
*  You just gotta fucking buckle up
*  and be prepared for the takeoff.
*  Now, if it take off and you don't know
*  where the seat belts are,
*  and you don't know where the lights and shit at,
*  well, now you got a fucked up rocket ride.
*  You're gonna crash.
*  It's over.
*  It's over if you're not ready.
*  I do it.
*  This thing airs.
*  And I remember watching it.
*  And at the end of the show,
*  something so small seemed so fucking big.
*  I say good night.
*  I put up two fingers.
*  And as I'm walking off the stage,
*  they put it in slow motion.
*  They put me in slow motion walking off the stage.
*  And there was a separation
*  from everything else that was on there.
*  It was almost like this guy's the guy.
*  It was a small tweak in editing.
*  I had nothing to do with it.
*  I just saw it.
*  And the slow motion walk off,
*  the crowd getting up, clapping.
*  You see people's faces, slow motion,
*  pointing, screaming.
*  And I'm walking off with like a bob.
*  And it was almost like a coined,
*  this is it.
*  This is going to be the guy.
*  I didn't do it.
*  I didn't mean for it to happen.
*  I didn't know it was gonna happen.
*  God bless the editors.
*  God bless the Shaq All-Star Comedy Jam.
*  After that aired,
*  I remember doing a show at Carolin Joe's.
*  This is a true fucking story.
*  Shout out to Lewis from Carolin's Comedy Club.
*  I was just doing a weekend.
*  Weekend, you're supposed to be doing three shows.
*  We sold out 15 shows.
*  We sold out 15 fucking shows.
*  How the fuck did you do that?
*  We didn't know.
*  Listen.
*  How many days?
*  We was there for like eight days.
*  We were there for like eight days.
*  Lewis can confirm this.
*  Carolin's Comedy Club.
*  That's crazy.
*  Michael Berkowitz can confirm this.
*  That's my public appearance agent.
*  We just kept getting calls.
*  We're gone.
*  We just put the tickets up for another show.
*  They're gone.
*  What?
*  What do you wanna do?
*  We can add another.
*  You wanna try to do a Wednesday night?
*  Yeah, go ahead.
*  It's gone.
*  Kevin, we added the Wednesday.
*  It's gone.
*  What do you wanna do?
*  You wanna see if we can add a late show Wednesday?
*  Yeah, fuck it.
*  I guess.
*  It's gone.
*  Tuesday, it went Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
*  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.
*  We was in that bitch till goddamn Wednesday.
*  Holy shit.
*  15 shows.
*  Carolin's Comedy Club.
*  What'd that feel like when it was happening?
*  I'm gonna say 12 to 15 shows.
*  I remember.
*  Because some of the days we could do one,
*  some we could do two.
*  But you don't know.
*  I'm like, I can't even understand this.
*  Carolin's Comedy Club was a big comedy club.
*  This is New York City.
*  This is the melting pot where you got some of everybody.
*  After that is when me and Bert said,
*  is this a New York thing?
*  Is the word get out in New York?
*  And we found out the Shaq's All Star Comedy Jam
*  was playing on show time around the clock.
*  It was just being pumped all day, all night.
*  And we put up some shows outside
*  and the comedy club started flying.
*  We was adding shows.
*  We said, let's do small theaters.
*  And then I did small theaters.
*  And right after that moment, I taped Seriously Funny.
*  So Shaq's All Star Comedy Jam hit so hard
*  that by the time I was ready to do Seriously Funny,
*  which was in three to four months,
*  people were so hype and ready to see me do something else
*  that that became a massive attraction.
*  Wow.
*  Seriously Funny took off and blew as well.
*  That's crazy that it was something
*  that you weren't even really thinking of.
*  Not even thinking about it.
*  Maybe that's why it was so free.
*  You know, so loose, no pressure.
*  Yeah, the shit that's done.
*  Now, by the way, Seriously Funny,
*  I damn near shit at myself before the show.
*  I damn near defecated on myself before the show
*  because I'm like, man, these people are here.
*  The theater sold out so fast.
*  I had LeBron, Shaq, the whole Cleveland Cavalier team
*  was there at the time.
*  It was unreal.
*  I was like, this is it.
*  This is my moment.
*  I gotta make this a thing.
*  Wow.
*  I can't fuck this up.
*  I cannot fuck this up.
*  The show ended up going great.
*  And then from there, the fucking star just continued to rise.
*  And that's when the engine within myself
*  started the click of go get, right?
*  So there's something you always had the go get.
*  Always had that.
*  Always had that.
*  I told you before, that's my mom.
*  RIP Nancy Hart.
*  Don't tell me I can't do something.
*  Cause now I'm pissed.
*  Now I'm gonna do it.
*  Don't tell me that.
*  And that's a gift and a curse.
*  That's a gift and a curse.
*  Like you saw in the doc, I don't know if you saw it,
*  but in my documentary, I put it all out there.
*  That's a curse.
*  Cav, don't put that video up.
*  Don't do that.
*  Don't tell me what the fuck not to do.
*  I'm gonna do it.
*  And sometimes it don't do what you think it was gonna do.
*  You don't know everything.
*  You don't know everything.
*  And you're not that great to think
*  that you do know everything.
*  And you can get bit in the ass by thinking that.
*  But you gotta get bit to go,
*  oh, let me get better at that.
*  So my go get comes from me just saying,
*  what's my reason not to go after
*  everything that I possibly can?
*  I will stand on a fucking building and say this, man.
*  It's a game.
*  This thing is serious,
*  but it's got a game like quality to it.
*  This thing called life.
*  It's got a game like quality to it.
*  And if you don't fucking see that,
*  you better open your eyes.
*  You better open your fucking eyes.
*  Because in this life,
*  the moves that we're making allow you to do more,
*  to get more, to see more, travel more,
*  explore, experience.
*  Or some people are dealt a different hand and it's tougher.
*  It's a darker road and it's, damn it, it's, fuck.
*  I wanna get out of this.
*  I can't, I'm doing, ugh.
*  How do I get out?
*  Fuck, I made it, oh.
*  It looked like I wasn't supposed to get out, but I'm out.
*  Everybody say you can't get out of this shit.
*  I did.
*  I'm out, I'm out.
*  I'm one of the people that got out.
*  It's a fucking, it's got a real game like quality to it.
*  And that doesn't mean that you play with it.
*  Understand what I'm saying here.
*  It means that you can do what you put your mind to.
*  And if you continue to put your mind to it,
*  the game opens up new levels.
*  Tell me I'm fucking saying something wrong.
*  You're saying something right.
*  You get a new level and each new level that gets opened up,
*  you're able to adapt a different mindset
*  and a different approach.
*  You can stop at that level or you can go,
*  I want more levels.
*  I want more fucking levels.
*  I don't like seeing shit that I have no idea
*  how to obtain or gain access to.
*  That frustrates me.
*  That frustrates me when people do things
*  and I don't know how they do it or did it.
*  Whether I'm gonna do it or not, I wanna know.
*  When you're around people that work in different atmospheres,
*  what do you do, man?
*  Oh man, I'm the guy that takes these labels right here.
*  Simple labels right here.
*  I have a manufacturing company where I do these,
*  but I do them in bulk.
*  So we do a thousand labels every 30 seconds
*  and I built a manufacturing lab
*  and this company here pays me X on a dollar
*  and I got 35 companies doing the same thing.
*  I've built a multimillion dollar business based off labels.
*  People don't understand how important labels are.
*  I did at the young age, so I started manufacturing labels.
*  You can manufacture fucking labels?
*  Now I'm intrigued.
*  Even if I didn't wanna do that,
*  I'm intrigued that that's a thing.
*  I'm intrigued.
*  I'm intrigued that you found a way to do that.
*  This table, is it handmade?
*  Does a company do these?
*  Is it fucking custom?
*  Where's the wood from?
*  If you really dig into everything, it comes from a thought.
*  It comes from a broken down thought.
*  So you can be a person that's just around
*  a bunch of brilliant thoughts and never ask questions
*  or you can soak some of that shit up.
*  You know what this pandemic showed me, Joe?
*  How our economy really fucking works.
*  Once again, I'm coming from the perspective
*  of a young black man from the hood.
*  I'm from the bottom.
*  I don't know shit about stocks.
*  I don't know nothing about investments.
*  Never have, right?
*  But I know through this pandemic,
*  now that I'm at a point where I'm actually into stocks
*  and I'm investing and putting a portfolio together,
*  well, I've really looked at the way that the world moves.
*  I've really looked at how we move as people.
*  How are we fucking still going?
*  What are we using?
*  What are we fucking using?
*  This is what I said to my kids.
*  I said, what are you still using?
*  What do you mean?
*  On a day to day, what do we have to use?
*  Tell me the things we have to use.
*  Toothpaste.
*  Who makes the toothpaste?
*  They told me who made the toothpaste.
*  Is that a company that you can invest in?
*  Do you feel like everybody uses this toothpaste?
*  If you do, that means that this is a company
*  that's been successful,
*  and may be successful for a long time,
*  because this is a necessary need of everyone.
*  That's an investment, kids.
*  What else do we use?
*  What else do we use every day?
*  Where do you go?
*  What do you like?
*  In the mornings, Starbucks.
*  Is that an investment?
*  Do you feel like everybody drank Starbucks?
*  We drank it all the time.
*  You feel like everybody else does too?
*  I think so.
*  That's an investment.
*  That's what you put money in,
*  because you feel like it's going to last,
*  it's going to grow.
*  What stores do we go to?
*  Where are we always at, Target?
*  How many people are in Target when we go?
*  A lot.
*  Is that an investment?
*  I guess.
*  Why do you guess?
*  At this point, you should know.
*  We talk about it all the time.
*  Why do you think it's an investment, Dad?
*  Why do you think it's not?
*  I'm talking to you about putting money in places
*  where you feel like it's going to grow.
*  Do you feel like Target's gonna shut down tomorrow?
*  Do you feel like they're gonna open more stores?
*  How do you feel?
*  This is a thing that I watch,
*  and this is a thing that I also watch people ignore.
*  This is what's wrong with our world,
*  because we don't talk to people enough like this.
*  We don't give them the simplicity behind
*  the way we fucking move and the way the world goes around.
*  If we did get the simplicity,
*  then we could have people taking $20 out their check
*  and creating a portfolio.
*  We could have people taking $40 to $50 out their check
*  and putting it in said thing.
*  Said stock, said thing.
*  Whatever it is, you can be doing it at a younger age.
*  You don't have to have the most crazy amount of money.
*  It can start off with the smallest amounts of money,
*  but you can learn it that can grow.
*  I watch it.
*  I pay attention.
*  That's what gets me fucking going, Joe.
*  I pay attention to everything.
*  My question is, why don't most of us?
*  Why are we comfortable with letting the world just go by?
*  I think a lot of people don't have the framework.
*  They don't know how to operate in that realm.
*  They don't know how to get going.
*  They don't know how to get started.
*  Information.
*  Yeah, but I love what you said about it being
*  there's a game-like quality to life.
*  That's such a perfect way to look at it.
*  It really is.
*  You played a game?
*  Yeah.
*  You played a game for how many years, Joe?
*  How many years you had your podcast?
*  11 years, right?
*  I'm gonna give you a very true story.
*  And to my brothers, the Plastic Cup Boys,
*  we got our radio show, Straight From the Heart.
*  Constantly preaching to us about,
*  it's not about now, it's about tomorrow.
*  Our radio show is a good radio show,
*  and we have a following, but it's not about now.
*  It's about tomorrow.
*  We gotta put the work in today
*  so that when tomorrow comes,
*  we are well-equipped for the conversation that may be.
*  I said, Joe had a fuckin' long ride
*  of preparing for tomorrow.
*  And when tomorrow hit, it had to hit correctly
*  because Joe never not did the work
*  on a day-to-day basis to prepare for tomorrow.
*  I got everybody fired up just off of the fact
*  that you continued to do your thing the way that you were,
*  regardless of conversations,
*  regardless of other offers and possibilities.
*  You felt something else was on the horizon for tomorrow.
*  But you knew it would come based off of your energy
*  and effort that you put into the thing that you have.
*  Realistically, I don't look at it that way.
*  How do you look at it?
*  I never look at a destination or a thing
*  or something happenin'.
*  I just keep doin' it.
*  I'm one of those weird grinders.
*  That's not weird.
*  That's a way for you to go.
*  But I trust the process,
*  but I don't ever look at it like there's a destination,
*  like a success moment, like a big thing, a big thing hits.
*  I just keep doin' it, and those things
*  sort of find their own way through management and agents.
*  I've put very little thinking into that.
*  I put almost all my thinking into just doing the thing
*  the best way that I can do it.
*  Metaphor for you then.
*  You're an amazing fuckin' fighter.
*  You are, I mean, I don't know how many black belts
*  you fuckin' got.
*  I just know I wouldn't fuck with you.
*  But you got some shit with you, right?
*  And if you are practicing a kick or a move,
*  if you do it, let's say 200,000 times
*  to make sure you get it perfect,
*  are you doin' that and figurein' that out for the unknown?
*  Or is it for, if I ever have to use it,
*  I want it to be so fuckin' right.
*  Yeah, that's always there.
*  That's always there, but the thing is always the technique.
*  The thing is always the process.
*  I think that's where I got this from podcasting
*  and even from stand-up.
*  It's just the grind.
*  The process.
*  It comes from martial arts.
*  The grind is like you gotta be there every day.
*  If you're there three days a week,
*  it's not as good as five.
*  You gotta be there five days a week.
*  And five might be better than seven,
*  because sometimes seven you burn out.
*  You wanna keep enthusiasm, because that's a fuel.
*  Enthusiasm, there's something about enthusiasm
*  that you gotta balance discipline and enthusiasm.
*  Discipline's critical.
*  You have to be able to show up,
*  but you also have to enjoy the shit out of it.
*  And so enjoying the shit out of it
*  with discipline is the key.
*  But you gotta ride those babies out.
*  You don't wanna fuck every day.
*  Take a couple days off.
*  Take a couple days off.
*  Want it.
*  Want it.
*  People fuck every day.
*  You don't even know what fuckin' feels like.
*  Take three, four days off and smoke a joint
*  and make out with your woman.
*  Get some energy back into it.
*  Yes, feel it.
*  Do you feel like, and this is something that,
*  I never have a good, I have an okay answer,
*  but I don't feel like it's ever the best answer.
*  When people say, well, what do you do
*  when you're not doing what you love, right?
*  And what I've said in the past and in the present as well
*  is I think in order to do what you love,
*  you gotta get through the obstacles
*  of the things that you don't love.
*  In life, right?
*  That's what you're trying to come up, yeah.
*  Yeah, that's what I was gonna ask.
*  Do you agree with that?
*  Getting over those hurdles and then eventually,
*  they lead you to the thing where you're like,
*  okay, now I'm ready to pursue said thing that I wanna do.
*  Or if you're in a job or a career
*  and you're like, I fuckin' hate my job,
*  what I feel is like, even if you hate your job,
*  you're supposed to be using that job
*  for something to get to something, right?
*  And if you're not, then that should be the thing
*  that you're figuring out.
*  Like, I don't like being here, but now that I'm here,
*  I'm going to do all that I can to get said thing
*  so that I can then be comfortable enough to move here.
*  If you just go into those things with hate,
*  because you were talking about enthusiasm
*  and it just made me think about it.
*  If you just got hate and you're just angry
*  about what you're doing every day,
*  then you're not even allowing yourself to figure out
*  the plan of how to escape the thing that you hate
*  to get to the thing that you love.
*  Yeah, I think it's important to have those jobs
*  that suck, man.
*  They like cement your foundation.
*  Lifeguard.
*  Because you don't wanna go back to those fuckin' places.
*  You don't wanna go back to those terrible jobs
*  where you gotta get up and be uninspired all day long.
*  But if you can get through that,
*  like that's this rigid structure of discipline
*  that allows you to apply that discipline
*  to things you love.
*  If you can apply discipline and learn how to apply
*  to something that sucks and get free,
*  have a game plan and get free, once you get free,
*  you have that ability to get up and do things that suck.
*  Guess what?
*  You're gonna get up and do things you love easier.
*  Even more.
*  And you're gonna remember construction sites
*  and delivering newspapers and all the stupid jobs
*  that I worked, I think about those fuckin' things
*  and I get up in the morning.
*  When I'm brushing my teeth, I think about them.
*  That's the fuckin' game, though.
*  That's the game.
*  That's why you gotta get through it.
*  You have to.
*  I say this, man, it's the story.
*  You're just puttin' that story together.
*  I don't think without the stories,
*  what do you talk about?
*  Right.
*  What is the interesting side of conversation
*  about your growth or your journey?
*  If it's just the easiest,
*  I just took the highway and got off at the exit
*  and right there at the exit, I found the gold.
*  Everybody else did.
*  It's no, what is it?
*  Or my dad was rich and I have a trust fund
*  and I never have to work ever.
*  What is the interesting side to that?
*  There is no bonus in that.
*  I just fuckin' broke my goddamn back.
*  The dopest thing for me about doing that
*  was not being able to walk, but then being told
*  that if I'm patient, I can recover fully,
*  I can get back to myself.
*  And me instantly thinking in my head,
*  I can actually be better than what I was.
*  If he's telling me I can get back to 100%,
*  I'm gonna be better.
*  So the game instantly clicked on.
*  All right, tomorrow we start, we play.
*  New level, I can't fuckin' walk.
*  God damn, here we go.
*  Can't wipe my ass, I'm not fuckin' getting it.
*  They say I can't get in the gym.
*  PT is some weird shit.
*  I'm just taking two steps on a fuckin' Boosa ball.
*  All right, this is a little discouraging,
*  but I know they said I'm supposed to do it three days.
*  I'm gonna listen to them, but on those other four days,
*  I'm gonna be like, is there anything else
*  that I can do to be working on?
*  Kevin, you can strengthen your lungs up,
*  work on your breathing.
*  Here's a breathing machine.
*  Okay, what about my hands?
*  Is there any way, my senses, tennis ball,
*  can I be squeezing, should I be doing anything?
*  No, we don't have anything like that.
*  We don't recommend it.
*  So if I found something and I researched,
*  if it's just motor skills and working on, is that fine?
*  Yeah, that's fine.
*  But you know, it's okay if that's what you wanna do.
*  Okay.
*  The doctors are just telling me the stuff
*  that I need to know.
*  Stay within those lines.
*  I'm gonna find other things that I can do
*  because I'm playing a game now.
*  I'm never gonna over-exert myself,
*  but the game is to be better.
*  How do I be better than what I was?
*  Because if I do that, ooh, fuck, for me, I just beat me.
*  Yeah.
*  This ain't about nobody else.
*  I don't give a fuck about nobody else.
*  I just beat me.
*  If I can keep beating myself, pause,
*  if I can keep doing that,
*  then that means that I'm in a battle
*  with the only person that fucking makes sense.
*  I'm in a battle with the only person
*  that I really wanna fucking beat, and that's me.
*  I don't care about anybody else.
*  I have no worry or gripe about the next man or woman's
*  journey or their level of success.
*  That's not what I'm up against.
*  Yeah.
*  If I can continue to outdo me from the day before,
*  then I'm ahead.
*  And I'm ahead.
*  And that's the newfound energy that I got out of life now.
*  I'm on this amazing Rocky story with myself.
*  It's in my head.
*  Nobody else is watching this movie but me.
*  It's in my head.
*  This is Rocky.
*  This is the comeback.
*  This is exactly what I saw in the movie.
*  And I'm gonna come back better than ever.
*  I'm gonna be 41.
*  My body's gonna be ripped up.
*  I'm gonna be about 8% body fat.
*  And then I'm ready.
*  Ready for what, Kevin?
*  I don't fucking know.
*  Ready to be better than you were before.
*  I don't know, but that's what I want.
*  I want that day to be like, yeah!
*  Now what?
*  And then I figure out what.
*  I figure out what that what is then.
*  Yeah.
*  Tell me, when you got injured,
*  you were explaining it to me before the podcast,
*  but I didn't wanna talk too much about it
*  because I wanted to hear it now
*  so everybody could hear it.
*  What exactly was the injury?
*  So I fractured my spine, right?
*  And it's either from my T10 to my L1
*  or from my L1 to my T10, whatever order that goes in.
*  How many fractures is that?
*  I mean, that's fucking, that's your spine.
*  That's about-
*  So you fractured basically everything.
*  I mean, you got like this much space in my back.
*  So you gotta think, first of all, I'm already small.
*  Right?
*  So this is practically my whole back,
*  if you look at this right here.
*  If you look at this, this is practically my whole back.
*  So all of this fractured.
*  And what happens is they had to fuse my spine.
*  So do they have to remove the discs in between?
*  They basically had to fix,
*  so the bones where it's fractured,
*  basically your spine is now out of whack.
*  The things that keep your spine connected
*  and that allow you the flexibility are out of whack.
*  I got pieces of those bone fragments
*  that are out of place out.
*  So they gotta fuse that shit back together.
*  So I got eight screws.
*  So do they take the disc material out
*  and compress it and then screw them all,
*  so is the bone all one piece now?
*  I think I'm one.
*  I don't know about the disc.
*  I don't know, I don't have that answer.
*  That's a little too technical for me
*  and I should know that,
*  because it was my body.
*  But what I do know is that this thing that's my spine
*  has eight screws.
*  And these eight screws now hold it together.
*  So through this time of healing,
*  because I now have metal in my back,
*  it was about getting your back
*  to be comfortable with the metal,
*  but also back to a normal level of flexibility.
*  So where people fuck up,
*  when you get this type of energy,
*  you stay still, you allow that metal to get stiff.
*  You're not moving it.
*  So now your movements become robotic with it.
*  So because as soon as I got out the hospital,
*  I started, I didn't have days off.
*  As soon as I got out, I started physical therapy.
*  I did not wait.
*  I got off medication.
*  I said, I'm not taking on meds.
*  My dad was on drugs.
*  I was like, I'm not fucking around with that.
*  So I dealt with the pain, but I said, I gotta start now,
*  because every day that I wait makes it harder to go.
*  So because I was back and forth, side to side,
*  doing all of those things,
*  I got my body to get accustomed to it.
*  And I got flexibility.
*  So now when you see me working out,
*  it looks as if I'm back,
*  and I'm probably 98% back to myself right now.
*  But the work that I put into my core
*  and my upper body over the years
*  are what saved me outside of God,
*  of course, in that situation.
*  Because I wanna tell those people just for you to know,
*  this health and wellness shit is so much bigger
*  than what you may think it is.
*  Taking care of your body,
*  you don't know when all of that stuff comes into play
*  and adds up correctly.
*  The human body is amazing.
*  Recovery, the ability to snap back
*  and go back to what it once was,
*  the body muscle memory,
*  all of that stuff plays a major factor.
*  So my healing was a lot faster
*  because of the years of work that I put into it before.
*  Now, if I had enough and I didn't have that core,
*  well, I'd be paralyzed.
*  I'd be fucking paralyzed.
*  I mean, they said, you're literally talking about this much.
*  Doctor, look me in the eyes, you're lucky to be walking.
*  This much.
*  If your core wasn't in the shape that it was,
*  and if you didn't have the strength
*  to take whatever that impact was and stay,
*  you would have been snapped
*  and you would never be walking again.
*  So that instantly, thank God I go, you know what?
*  Thank God for my trainer who jumped into my life
*  at a certain time and changed my way of thinking.
*  Boss, Ronald Boss Everline,
*  and we've been rocking for seven years
*  and the consistency of four years before of every day,
*  every day.
*  So now I'm like, you're not wasting your time ever.
*  So when those people say, what are you working out for?
*  What are you getting in shape for?
*  Why are you going every day?
*  You don't know when you're gonna need
*  to fucking tap into all of the work that you've done.
*  You don't know.
*  You don't know if you'll ever need it,
*  but to just know that you've taken care of yourself,
*  to know that you've given yourself a chance
*  to fucking not only survive, but perform.
*  You've given yourself a chance to perform
*  at a high level on a day to day
*  by taking care of your engine.
*  This is my machine.
*  So I'm taking care of the engine, just like any car.
*  Oil changes, just like your fucking,
*  your brakes, your tires, the rotors,
*  all of that shit, you taking care of that
*  so that it's a great ride every time.
*  You gotta do the same with your body.
*  Don't ignore that shit, people.
*  We dropping like flies right now.
*  Heart attack, strokes, kidney failure.
*  You got people with diabetes.
*  You got people getting legs or arms cut off from bad eating,
*  from bad eating over the course of years.
*  Take that shit serious.
*  Don't wait till the end.
*  That's serious.
*  That's not a joke.
*  So when I look at people dying around me,
*  we have no control over when the day is gonna come,
*  but I'm going to try to help amplify my time here
*  as much as I can.
*  That's the big one, right?
*  Amplify your time.
*  You have energy.
*  You have a different kind of energy
*  than someone who's unhealthy.
*  You have the ability to push forward.
*  You have the ability to get shit done.
*  You have more enthusiasm,
*  because your body feels good.
*  Why do you not, why?
*  I want to be careful the way I say this,
*  because I don't want to seem like I'm coming down
*  on anybody that's not.
*  But why don't you want to take care of yourself?
*  I think they do.
*  I think it's just habits are very hard to break.
*  There's a lot of comfort in just the same thing every day.
*  Open up the cabinet, Twinkies, fuck it.
*  I'll start tomorrow.
*  Fuck it.
*  I feel like eating those chips.
*  And you just settle into it.
*  And then there's this disappointment
*  that comes from settling in.
*  And it's comfort and it's disappointment at the same time.
*  Like you really, well, I guess that's me.
*  And you accept it.
*  And I think sometimes people are scared of improvement
*  because they're scared of failure.
*  So if they can just kind of slide
*  into the same bullshit every day,
*  it makes them feel less uneasy.
*  You know what?
*  What I say and what I will say
*  goes back to the decision, goes back to information.
*  It's not bad if you want those things.
*  I don't think that people are supposed
*  to live a robotic life and I don't eat this ever
*  and I don't do this.
*  Why don't you just point to the rock
*  in his fucking cheat days?
*  I mean, his fucking cheat, first of all,
*  he eats for a village.
*  That son of a bitch.
*  Well, he is a village.
*  It's unreal what he puts down when he puts down.
*  And that's what I'm saying.
*  You should enjoy yourself and enjoy your life.
*  But I think that there should be a give and take.
*  Like, all right, I'm gonna eat the way I wanna eat.
*  I'm not compromising that because I love food.
*  But let me put a half hour in a day of walking.
*  Let me do something so where I'm active,
*  so there's at least a give and take.
*  That's what I would say to people out there.
*  I'm not saying in no way, shape, or form,
*  don't do this ever and that's wrong and you're living,
*  you're gonna destroy yourself.
*  No, that's unrealistic.
*  That's unrealistic.
*  I think you should definitely be happy.
*  You should definitely do the things that you enjoy
*  because, like I said, in my mind, this is a game.
*  You playing the game.
*  Be happy while you're playing it.
*  Don't be miserable.
*  One way to play the game is to challenge yourself.
*  Give yourself a month.
*  Write down for a month, for one month,
*  I'm not drinking a single soda.
*  For one month, I'm gonna do something,
*  some exercise every day, and I'm gonna write down
*  what it is for one month.
*  The fucking game.
*  Here's how I think.
*  I don't know if that's a book title or not
*  or if it hasn't, has been or hasn't,
*  but god damn it, that could be my next one.
*  The game.
*  Yeah.
*  Now I know you guys are hearing this.
*  I think it may be, but maybe the game of life,
*  that's something, but it's something there.
*  It's such a synergy within that.
*  Maybe just call it game.
*  Something, it's there.
*  Because your statement of there's a game-like quality
*  to life resonates.
*  As soon as you said that, I was like, ooh, that's it.
*  That's the way to look at it.
*  Don't just look at it like life.
*  Look at it like you're trying to succeed.
*  You're trying to get ahead and win.
*  The game-like quality of life, that's it.
*  It's a dope thing.
*  I'm gonna really harp on it.
*  So you're recovering from your back injury.
*  How long ago was the injury?
*  How long ago was the crash now?
*  September, so what is that?
*  September, October, November, December,
*  January, February, March, April, was this May?
*  Yeah, so only eight months.
*  Almost, it was about to be June, so about to be nine.
*  About to get into nine.
*  You said you're like 98% or not?
*  98%, I'm down to probably 10% body fat right now.
*  As far as movement, you could basically do everything?
*  I'm doing everything.
*  Wow.
*  I'm doing everything.
*  I'm up to running again.
*  I'm probably at, I'm probably at three,
*  I can go three and a half miles straight
*  before I'm like, ooh.
*  The back starts to bother you?
*  Yeah, before I get tight.
*  What are you doing for the back?
*  Are you doing yoga?
*  What kind of exercise are you doing?
*  I got physical therapy.
*  You know, that's random.
*  Shout out to Dr. Pat.
*  You know, I make sure that getting the massages,
*  getting the work done, because I'm doing so much
*  within working out, I don't wanna not
*  take care of that as well.
*  So from heating it, from treatment,
*  just literally doing things to make sure
*  that I'm constantly working on those muscles
*  and not forgetting them.
*  I'm getting older.
*  I don't wanna act like that's not the case
*  or that's not a reality.
*  I'm 40 now.
*  So how do I take care of this machine
*  so at 50, I'm not moving as if I'm 70, you know?
*  I'll say that's been a great adjustment,
*  but one that's really made me feel better.
*  Like stretching, you know, I didn't understand
*  the importance of stretching, of actually resting.
*  Gotta get it, let's go, let's go, Tom.
*  Waits, hit it, clanging and banging, baby.
*  Clanging and banging.
*  But now, you know, make sure you get your rest time
*  so that you can come back and give the energy.
*  Your cardio changes, row machines,
*  I'm on a bike, you know, I'm pelotonin',
*  I'm hydroin', I'm running, so the workouts change
*  and you become more consistent with your system,
*  with my new system, so I think by July,
*  July, my goal is for my 41st birthday, that's July 6th,
*  to be around eight, eight and a half percent body fat
*  at the age 41.
*  So it's all about looking good with the body fat?
*  For me, the body fat means
*  that I've just been super focused.
*  Like, I eat, I don't want people to think that I don't eat.
*  I'm not a foodie though, so it doesn't really count,
*  but you know, I'm not on some strict, crazy diet.
*  You're not a foodie like you don't enjoy?
*  I'm not a foodie, man.
*  I don't eat red meat.
*  I eat no red meat, no fish, no seafood.
*  I'm a plant-based eater.
*  Behind.
*  Everything's plant.
*  I'll go chicken every once in a while.
*  I'll dabble into my chicken.
*  And that's what people don't understand.
*  I don't think people really get that or understand that.
*  It's like, just because you make the decision to go
*  and try plant-based doesn't mean that you have to engulf
*  in that world.
*  Learn it, understand it,
*  and see if there's benefits that work for you.
*  I stopped eating red meat so much
*  because I learned that I didn't have to have it.
*  I thought that I needed it to survive.
*  That's what I was under the mindset.
*  Like, if I don't eat this,
*  things are gonna change for me.
*  That's what I thought.
*  But once I found out there was protein and things
*  and other foods and other resources,
*  then I started to learn more
*  about the plant-based food space.
*  I was like, I'm gonna give it a try.
*  And I started trying the Beyond Meat.
*  And I fucking fell in love with the Beyond Meat.
*  I was like, I don't feel a difference.
*  Let me tell you something right now.
*  Those Beyond Meat things are not good for you.
*  I love them.
*  I'm sure you do.
*  I love them.
*  I'm sure you enjoy them.
*  That's fine.
*  I love them.
*  But if you're gonna be plant-based,
*  that's not the way to go.
*  In terms of the overall health,
*  it's not bad if you want just taste,
*  if you enjoy just mouth pleasure,
*  but they're not good for you.
*  It's all oils.
*  It's all those plant-based oils,
*  and it's all processed and weird.
*  Just eat vegetables.
*  What you are is a very smart man.
*  So I would never challenge the information
*  that you may have that I don't have.
*  So now, after being told such a thing,
*  I would look and see for myself.
*  But I can say to date,
*  I love the Beyond option
*  because it's not only taking the place
*  of the meat,
*  I like the different versions of it that's available.
*  As long as you're enjoying it,
*  nothing wrong with something you're enjoying.
*  You're obviously very healthy.
*  Yeah, I can say I haven't seen,
*  I'll put it this way,
*  since going plant-based and jumping into that space
*  and choosing that,
*  because there was a moment where you had the Impossible,
*  you had the Beyond,
*  and you had all this stuff that was out there,
*  and you're trying everything.
*  I like that one the most.
*  So after liking the Beyond one the most,
*  then I said, let me see if I can be more consistent.
*  Since doing that,
*  I've seen a significant change
*  in just being more vibrant,
*  more up and at it.
*  My days were always long,
*  so there used to be a wall that I would hit.
*  When I was eating and I was,
*  red meat, whether it be the burger patty without the bun,
*  whether it was steak and eggs for protein,
*  I would always hit a wall a day where I'm dozing.
*  I'm dozing and I'm crashing.
*  I don't have those crashes.
*  Maybe you weren't getting enough carbohydrates.
*  Could be, once again.
*  Joe, you're a very smart man,
*  so I'm not gonna challenge your knowledge,
*  because I know that this is a space
*  where you're well-equipped.
*  You do your research, you read, you know.
*  I've heard you talk about things various times.
*  In this space, I'll just say,
*  it's one of those things where I was like,
*  okay, this is a pattern that I fell into,
*  has been comfortable, but I've seen the results.
*  That's all that matters.
*  There's bio-variability that everybody
*  has to take into consideration.
*  Your body's gonna be different than Jamie's,
*  it's gonna be different than mine.
*  Everybody's body's gonna respond
*  different to different kind of foods.
*  It's really different.
*  Some people work great off of just fish.
*  I know people that are on a carnivore diet
*  and they're in the healthiest shape
*  they've ever been in their life.
*  All they eat is red meat, these rib-eyes all day long.
*  And you go, what the fuck?
*  That doesn't even make any sense.
*  Meanwhile, they look great.
*  Swear to you, they've never felt better.
*  Psoriasis is gone, joint pain gone, healthier than ever.
*  And then I know other people
*  that are all 100% plant-based.
*  And they're like, I got off my meds, I feel great.
*  I think focus on eating properly,
*  whether it's eating properly plant-based
*  or eating properly with a carnivore diet,
*  just cutting out all the bullshit.
*  That's, and focusing on the fact
*  that you're eating for health and for vitality.
*  That's a big part of it.
*  You just said the key thing, though.
*  The key things you just said is
*  people are doing different things that work for them.
*  There is no right or wrong way.
*  And I think that's the biggest misconception.
*  The misconception is that you're doing it wrong.
*  There's one way.
*  There's only one, nah, don't do that.
*  Don't eat that.
*  There's a lot of ways.
*  There's so many different ways that can work for you.
*  Don't be afraid to try or just experience
*  what those options are and find your comfort space.
*  That's why I say within that plant-based space,
*  people that go, yeah, man, I'm plant-based,
*  but I feel bad because I ate something.
*  It's like, you don't have, it's not,
*  there is no rule to what you wanna do for you.
*  And you gotta be open to making adjustments, too.
*  Do you know C.T. Fletcher?
*  I do know of him.
*  I don't know him, but I know of him.
*  Love that guy to death.
*  Hulk.
*  He's as motivational as anybody that's ever lived.
*  He had a heart attack.
*  Had his heart replaced.
*  Got a new heart.
*  And he, I don't think he's confirmed it,
*  but he believes it's an Asian woman.
*  And I don't know if that's how he feels
*  or like he's had some weird feelings
*  about having this other person's heart inside of his body.
*  And he went 100% plant-based.
*  Just changed everything.
*  Changed his entire diet and puts all these videos up.
*  He thinks his heart came from an Asian woman.
*  He believes his heart came from an Asian woman.
*  I don't think he's confirmed that
*  because I don't think they tell you.
*  But I think he's, he just.
*  Did you wanna know?
*  Do you wanna know?
*  Yeah, I kinda wanna know, yeah.
*  Maybe he knows now.
*  I don't believe he knew last time I saw him in here.
*  But the first time I met him, he's a powerful guy.
*  It's still your motherfucking set.
*  Like he's that guy.
*  And he's just always this booming voice
*  and just gigantic muscles.
*  And he's all drive and go.
*  And then when his heart failed
*  and then he had to have his heart replaced,
*  I saw him about a year later.
*  And he had this remarkable calm that had come over him.
*  He was just like this different person.
*  Very loving and embracing.
*  And had all this happiness and all this joy
*  and all this appreciation.
*  And now all he needs is plants.
*  I mean he's a, and he swears by it.
*  It's that light.
*  For him, that's the way to go.
*  No, I'm talking about that light.
*  I saw that light.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  When you come close to that light.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's in that light that I'm talking about is death.
*  If you come close to that light,
*  when you do and if you are fortunate enough
*  to come back from that light,
*  you value life differently.
*  You can't, there are no bad days for me.
*  There are no bad days for me.
*  My biggest cry in life came from the first day
*  that I came home from the hospital.
*  Because I never had to see that house again.
*  There was an option of me never seeing that home again.
*  There was an option of me never walking
*  on that driveway again.
*  There was an option of me never seeing my wife
*  and my kids again.
*  Like the biggest, and I mean it wasn't like a buildup cry.
*  It was pull up, get out, feet touch the ground.
*  What the fuck just came over me?
*  Boo hoo.
*  Like what the fuck, what just happened?
*  By the way, a painful cry because my back was fucked up.
*  So I'm crying hard and I'm in pain.
*  But the realization of none of this has to be.
*  You're not in control.
*  Hey Kevin, you're not in control buddy.
*  You thought you were.
*  You moved for a minute like, nah I got this.
*  I'm gonna do that, don't worry about it, I got it.
*  We'll be good, I'm gonna make sure it happens.
*  As if you were in control.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's literally that.
*  At any decision, at any given time, it can be over.
*  And it's not until you get close to that light
*  that you truly respect that.
*  I respect that, there are no bad days.
*  Hey man, miss me with any bullshit.
*  I'm smiling because I have no reason to be angry
*  because I don't have to be here.
*  You appreciate that sunshine
*  because you've been in the pouring rain.
*  Man, hey, hey, that's a fuck yes.
*  So when you talk about C.T. Fletcher
*  and you talk about his calm, you know what man?
*  I've been on the other side.
*  He's been, yeah, let's go and that's great.
*  That doesn't mean that he doesn't still have that
*  but now there's a different energy
*  and a different level of relaxation that can come
*  because I know how fortunate I am to be taking these steps.
*  Yeah, it's not just a theory.
*  Every day really truly is a gift.
*  Jeez, and you take it for granted.
*  It's real.
*  You take it for fucking granted, man.
*  I'm gonna tell you, not being able to wipe my ass
*  changed everything.
*  Do you got one of them bidets in your house
*  you press the button and it shoots the water up your ass?
*  I couldn't even do that.
*  Really?
*  I couldn't do that.
*  I'm talking, you take it for granted.
*  You take it for granted, man.
*  All of this conversation is clapping, it's easy.
*  Hey, come here.
*  All this shit here.
*  All the movement.
*  You just think it's okay.
*  You go through a situation where it's compromised.
*  How long did it take before you could start walking again?
*  Normal or semi-normal?
*  I lied in a hospital because I didn't want them to know
*  that I was having pain
*  because I thought that they were gonna stop me
*  from letting me continue to try my walks.
*  It was like day seven in the hospital
*  and I had the walker and it was slow walks
*  but I was dragging.
*  It was upper body.
*  And I was masking it as if I was feet, right?
*  Because I didn't wanna stop trying.
*  Like that was my fucking,
*  my go get, my drive for anything was those,
*  that half hour or 40 where I could get up and go walk
*  because I was just laying in the bed all day.
*  And God bless me and my wife and my kids.
*  There was, there's times like if this is the remote control
*  and I'm in the bed and I just wanna get to the control,
*  well, I can't get to it.
*  If you didn't position the control down here by my hands
*  so I could get it, this here throws my whole fucking,
*  so now I can't press the button to call nurse
*  and every second is, babe, can you grab the control for me?
*  Have do.
*  And there was a time where my son,
*  my son was like, fuck it,
*  my son just slept in the bed with me.
*  My son, he was like, I'm here dad, I'm up.
*  My son didn't wanna go to school,
*  my daughter didn't wanna go to school.
*  They didn't wanna leave my side, they stayed there.
*  And middle of the night, if they heard me,
*  you all right dad, what you want?
*  They were up.
*  My son doubled as nurse, my daughter doubled as nurse,
*  Nico doubled as it.
*  You know, they were there.
*  My brother came and that's when the,
*  that's when the care about what was important really changed.
*  The shit that I thought was important,
*  the things that you think are important,
*  you get to looking around that hospital room,
*  it's four walls.
*  None of that shit that you think is important is in there.
*  It's one of these people, none of the other shit was in there.
*  None of it, none of it was fucking in there.
*  It's also gotta make you feel great
*  that there's that much love, you know,
*  that they cared about you that much.
*  That's what gets you, that's what gets you through it.
*  So those little steps that I was taking, you know,
*  the discomfort of not being able to do,
*  the love and energy made me go,
*  it's gonna be all right, I'm gonna get there.
*  Cause you definitely feel defeated for a little bit.
*  And so how long before you were walking without a walker?
*  I was stubborn man, so probably two and a half weeks,
*  two, two and a half weeks.
*  I should have had the walker though.
*  Wow.
*  I should have had the walker,
*  but it was, I'm giving the perception
*  that it's better than what it is.
*  And I had the back brace on.
*  You faked it till you made it.
*  It was, I definitely, I definitely,
*  I definitely was, was, hey, smiling.
*  What's up y'all?
*  Right.
*  Good morning everybody, given this perception of.
*  Bill Burr told me he went to visit you.
*  Yeah, Bill came to see me.
*  And he said, he goes,
*  see the fucking guy's already walking around.
*  He's crazy.
*  Yeah, I had to give him the perception
*  cause you don't, I don't want you to worry.
*  I got, it's me.
*  Let me, I'm going through it and I'm gonna figure it out.
*  I don't want that worry placed on anybody else.
*  I told you, I stopped fucking taking meds.
*  So every night was a horrible night.
*  That's so much better for you though.
*  Just accept that pain.
*  Every night.
*  I did that with my knee surgery
*  and it's obviously a much less painful thing,
*  but I was like, I took that shit once
*  for one of my knee surgeries one day.
*  And I was like, this, I feel so fucking stupid.
*  I slobbered on myself.
*  That's when I said, no, no.
*  I was talking to pieces of slobber.
*  Yeah, I was by myself alone in my apartment
*  and I was thinking, this was, you know,
*  back when I lived in New York and I was like,
*  I am not doing this again.
*  This is one day I'd rather,
*  I'd rather be in searing pain and have my senses
*  than to be stupid.
*  I felt so dumb.
*  Felt dumb.
*  Dumb, it's just like, yeah.
*  I'm like, this is not me.
*  I'm not into, I'm not into escape.
*  I don't want to escape.
*  I want to dig deep.
*  Not that bad.
*  I'd rather just feel the pain.
*  I'm not looking for it that bad.
*  It's a sensation.
*  It's a terrible sensation, but I know what it is.
*  It's just letting me know that there's a problem
*  and we'll fix that problem eventually.
*  I don't like the look that comes with being high.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when I see what people look like that are,
*  I don't like that look.
*  The pill high?
*  See, I like the weed high.
*  No, that's, I'm talking about this shit here.
*  Oh yeah.
*  When you don't know what you,
*  this shit here, you don't know what's going on
*  with your hands, I don't like that.
*  I don't want to look like that.
*  Yeah, I think that's people that are in so much pain
*  all day just emotionally that they just need
*  some sort of escape from it.
*  One thing I will,
*  Instead of embracing it.
*  I will not knock anybody that is dealing
*  with any type of mental struggle
*  because that is something that's so serious
*  because nobody understands what that is
*  except that person.
*  So I never talk as if that's an easy thing.
*  I talk as if that's a thing that I don't fully know about.
*  So you can only have some type of remorse
*  and feeling of understanding for people
*  that are battling any type of mental illness
*  or mental health because that's just a different,
*  it's a different monster and different machine.
*  So whatever the reasons to escape that are
*  for you and from you,
*  you know, that's something that's TBD,
*  TBD Determined between you and whoever's trying to help you.
*  People on the outside, we got no right.
*  We got no right if you're not fucking
*  dealing with the same thing.
*  You got no right to judge that ever.
*  There's no way we can understand what's going on.
*  No way I can understand what's going on in your head
*  other than you telling me about it
*  and me trying to decipher it
*  and trying to put it into words.
*  But that's one of the more interesting things
*  about talking to people.
*  It's like when you talk to people
*  and you find out how they feel and think about things,
*  it shifts your own ideas of what life is
*  and I'm trying to look at life through other people's eyes.
*  And the only way you get that is through them talking.
*  I mean, I'm dealing with it now with my kids.
*  You know, I got two teenagers.
*  So my daughter, you know, my daughter got mad.
*  This is a while ago. She got so mad.
*  She was just, forget it.
*  And it was like, it was like a little rage.
*  I didn't attack her for it.
*  I said, there's something that made you do that.
*  It's bigger than just this.
*  It's not about what we're dealing with now.
*  I said, that was something else
*  that I've never seen.
*  And I said, I'm gonna give you a second.
*  Take some time to yourself.
*  I said, and later, if you wanna talk about anything,
*  your dad is here.
*  I said, let's talk if you want to.
*  And we got this thing called free speaking zone
*  in our house.
*  Free speaking zone means as a parent,
*  I can't get mad at you about what you said.
*  I gotta give you a conversation based off of what you said.
*  And I gotta act as if you're not my child for that moment.
*  You cannot abuse free speaking zone though.
*  You can't abuse it.
*  That don't mean every time you're in trouble,
*  free speaking zone, you're abusing it.
*  And now you risk free speaking zone going away.
*  I like that idea.
*  So you gotta use it correctly.
*  So, you know, my daughter came to me
*  and in like the nicest voice,
*  she was like, free speaking zone.
*  And I was like, yeah.
*  I said, what's up?
*  And she just started talking to me
*  about some things that were bothering her.
*  And when we talk, what I found is
*  I can relate to my daughter
*  because I know for sure that where I come from,
*  it's allowed me to see exactly what she's seeing
*  plus so much more, plus so much more.
*  And this was a time where the hair was an issue.
*  My daughter went through a big hair thing.
*  She wanted her hair to be a certain way
*  and the hair wouldn't,
*  there was no way that her hair was going to
*  be able to look like what she wanted it to.
*  So the discussion was, honey, as a young black girl,
*  your hair is not gonna do what your friend's hair does.
*  My daughter goes to a private school.
*  So there's white girls here.
*  You got some mixed girls here.
*  And these girls are out and they can jump in the pool,
*  get out and their hair is a certain way.
*  And I'm like, honey, yours isn't gonna do that.
*  But if you want a different look,
*  then that means that we can work on ways to obtain it.
*  But honey, it's not gonna happen overnight.
*  And I had to make sure that my daughter understood
*  how beautiful she was.
*  I had to make sure that my daughter understood
*  why it's okay for her hair to be different
*  and be unique and not the same.
*  I had to go into a full father programming
*  of making you understand your value.
*  And my daughter needed that.
*  But it wasn't something that just came out of nowhere.
*  Like dad, I wanna talk to you about my hair.
*  It was an anger that she later then came
*  and wanted to discuss.
*  But if I didn't have the free speaking zone,
*  that's some shit that just would have been in.
*  And never talked about.
*  And never talked about.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was something that she used as a reason
*  to say what I don't like and don't judge me dad,
*  but this is really making me mad.
*  Well, it seems like you've developed this philosophy
*  that applies not just to work and not just to success,
*  but also to family and relationships.
*  There's a lot of carryover in all of this.
*  It's like accepting things for what they are,
*  but looking at a positive way to improve them,
*  even in terms of just communication with your family.
*  I mean, that's priority.
*  Yeah.
*  Priority number one.
*  I mean, that's this, it's so, it's so dope
*  to be able to build what we're building.
*  Cause it's not a tradition.
*  This is not, we don't have a family tradition.
*  We're the first.
*  Right.
*  This is the first.
*  Right.
*  I don't come from mom and dad, same house, kids, dogs,
*  and dinner at night at 6 p.m.
*  I don't come from that.
*  Right.
*  I don't know how to do that.
*  So we are now learning that, you know,
*  divorced, ex-wife, new wife, step kids, new kid,
*  brothers and sisters, coincide with ex-wife, new wife.
*  Make sure that we all understand this is our world.
*  How do we co-parent?
*  Bumps, of course.
*  Figuring it out, of course.
*  Kids, household, in our household, let's build something.
*  Dinners, let's make this a thing.
*  Conversations, no phones, let's make it a thing.
*  Movie night, taco Tuesdays, game night,
*  all this silly shit that you may look past are memories.
*  Family trips, family walks.
*  Walking the dogs together, all of this shit we're building.
*  So I'm fascinated at giving my kids stories to hold onto.
*  When they get older, remember that time
*  when we did sad thing, sad thing, sad thing?
*  Where were we at that summer?
*  Remember when such and such happened
*  and you fell in the thing and dad had to come get you?
*  Oh my God, you know what?
*  Dad, you know what I wanna go back to?
*  You know what we wanna do?
*  We're building it.
*  So my hope is that as I grow older,
*  I'm able to look at a new era within the heart.
*  Within this heart family name, this heart legacy.
*  I'm looking at generations.
*  You know, I got two sons.
*  I got two sons, man.
*  That's an unbelievable thing because this name goes.
*  I got a daughter, that's my oldest.
*  I'm about to have another daughter.
*  Now it's like fuck, Kev, you really, it's bigger than you.
*  It's about this and it's about what they have
*  but it's about what they remember.
*  I'm doing my part in life,
*  to go back to what we talked about earlier,
*  by making this generation better than what I was.
*  I'm giving you the fucking tools, guys.
*  You don't gotta do what I do, you don't gotta be what I am
*  but I'm giving you the tools to at least want
*  to aspire to be.
*  Is there a struggle to find time,
*  like to manage the time between work
*  and family, relationships?
*  Not after that accident.
*  No.
*  Not after that fucking accident.
*  Accident was the best eye-opening experience ever.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I was married to my career dating my family.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, right.
*  I'm all about this work and all about this hustle.
*  Granted, there's nothing wrong with that.
*  It's a good thing.
*  But after a certain point,
*  you gotta prioritize accordingly.
*  When you get to a certain point
*  where the decisions that can be made
*  are a little more controlled
*  and you have the ability to maneuver differently
*  because of the success that you've obtained,
*  make those adjustments.
*  I didn't make those adjustments.
*  I was still hustle, hustle, hustle.
*  Granted, great dad, we're doing stuff.
*  I'm home, I'm getting back home.
*  But my in and outs, three days, I'm out.
*  Two days, three days, I'm out.
*  I gotta go film the movie.
*  Y'all come down for the weekends.
*  All right, I see you guys.
*  We'll eat dinner, we'll do stuff,
*  and it's great, crammed it all in.
*  All right, y'all, I gotta go, I'm working.
*  And it's not bad,
*  but now, all right, I'll film a movie.
*  After I'm done filming a movie,
*  I need to take 30 days off.
*  I need to take 40 days off.
*  That's just with me and the fam.
*  Now, hey, you go tour, it was just bow,
*  year and a half, we out.
*  Four days out the fucking week,
*  I'm out year and a half, I got to get it.
*  Well, now, let's go a month and a half,
*  let's stop for three weeks.
*  I'm with the fam.
*  So I still have my three days a week that I was here,
*  but then I'm gonna stop for three weeks.
*  This is dedicated to fam time,
*  don't nobody do anything with me or talk to me.
*  I'm home.
*  Now, my office, I was in that office when we fucking open,
*  office open at nine, I'm there at eight.
*  You know, there's a chance that I may be in that office
*  till fucking six.
*  Now, yo, no matter what, guys,
*  that day in the office has to end at like three.
*  I gotta be home for dinner.
*  I got dinner with the fam.
*  My priorities have changed.
*  But it brings me back to the decisions
*  that you're now able to make based off of
*  life's circumstances, life's lessons.
*  So because of all the shit that I went through,
*  because of the things that I now got to see,
*  because of that hospital room and those four walls
*  and me seeing my family and what that love did for me
*  and to me, well, I'd be damned if I fucking look past that.
*  I'd be damned if I not do what I'm supposed to do
*  and give that the same amount of attention in return.
*  Because my eyes got open.
*  Fuck, is that why that happened?
*  What are you saying to me?
*  Was I supposed to, what?
*  Okay, I'm gonna assume, I'm gonna assume
*  and I'm gonna look at the signs that are clearly being given
*  and I'm gonna try my best to do my part.
*  I'm gonna try my best to grow.
*  So my time now is so valuable
*  but the priority within my time are making sure
*  that the people that I love and that love me have some time.
*  When it's all said and done, I wanna know
*  that I made those adjustments.
*  I wanna know that I did my part.
*  You achieved that balance.
*  Absolutely.
*  But it was learned.
*  It was learned.
*  Now this is information.
*  Yes.
*  It's fucking information.
*  And there's one side of information that I had
*  which was go get it, I'm out, I'm out.
*  I got to go get it.
*  I don't got time to be fucking standing there, man.
*  There's shit to do, which I still do do.
*  I don't wanna make it seem like that isn't in me
*  but there's a balance.
*  There's now a balance.
*  That's the trickiest shit in life.
*  Yeah, is to find that balance.
*  Find a balance.
*  Not just be a fucking savage out there grinding
*  and attacking all day but to have that balance
*  and appreciate, especially appreciate family, right?
*  It's something that I've had to learn
*  and that I'm still learning.
*  It's not something that I've knocked out the park
*  completely yet because it's a growing fucking.
*  It's a living thing.
*  Yeah, you gotta just keep being a sponge
*  and being willing to fucking grow.
*  Tell me about this audible thing.
*  Audible is an amazing partner of mine now.
*  My first book, I Can't Make This Up, Life Lessons
*  was a New York Times number one bestseller
*  and I got bit.
*  I got bit by the book.
*  Wow, as an author, I wanted to write a book.
*  I did it.
*  Look at the success that it had.
*  The opportunity came up for me to voice that book
*  on audible and the audible success was just as good,
*  if not greater than my hardcover.
*  People loved the fact that the stories were real
*  but hearing my voice and hearing me be personable
*  while being real was a bonus from other things
*  than they've ever had the privilege of listening to.
*  So I said, I wanna do another one, man,
*  but I'm big on this motivation, self-help,
*  inspiration thing.
*  I'm really big on trying to do my part.
*  So as I was telling you earlier, I said, in my life, man,
*  I got so many stories of all of my twists and turns
*  and right moves and wrong moves
*  and decision-making that enhanced those moves
*  or that devalued them and made them incorrect.
*  Ultimately, if I were to give information,
*  it's just to open up people's eyes,
*  to open up your eyes to the reality
*  of you competing with you.
*  I want people to understand that we lose
*  because we are okay with ignoring our faults.
*  It's not until you can accept your faults, your bullshit,
*  that you can grow and do better.
*  We point the finger a lot by we, myself included.
*  I'm an example of it.
*  Yo, I didn't do that because nobody told me.
*  I didn't get up, I didn't hear the alarm.
*  Why didn't you call me and get me up?
*  Yo, I didn't know he was gonna go eat.
*  Did nobody tell me he was gonna go eat?
*  I would've came to eat, but y'all ain't tell me.
*  I didn't know we had a test today.
*  Why'd you tell me we had a test today?
*  I didn't study,
*  because nobody reached out and tell me.
*  There's so many things that we place the blame
*  on others for that are truly our responsibility,
*  and it becomes a habit.
*  It's a force of habit.
*  So it's not until you break that habit
*  that you can do bigger and better shit.
*  So this audible original of mine called The Decision
*  is about making you look at shit differently,
*  making you realize the tone of today,
*  and making you understand how much you're a part of it.
*  I got a big thing on social media in there
*  where I'm like, social media is mindfuck people,
*  and to people now thinking that it's what the world thinks.
*  Social media has mindfuck people,
*  and to thinking that the comments below a post
*  are what the world must be feeling and thinking about you.
*  The insecurity levels have raised to an all-time high,
*  because my belief is now I posted something,
*  people are saying these things underneath,
*  I don't wanna go outside because this is how they feel.
*  So I've now put this shit in my head
*  that as soon as I walk outside, if you look at me,
*  you talking about my post, ain't you?
*  What post?
*  What the fuck is you talking about?
*  You saw my post, didn't you?
*  And that's why you looking at me like that.
*  What are you, what?
*  We now think that this is the way of the world,
*  and we're so engulfed into it that the negative is so loud
*  that you don't even see the positive.
*  Even if it's overwhelmingly positive,
*  and just a few negatives.
*  You don't see it.
*  You concentrate on those negatives.
*  You don't see it.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a black billionaire that paid off student loans.
*  It was a story for about a day and a half.
*  Another story popped up of a reality star
*  sucked somebody's dick in the bathroom,
*  it went on for three weeks, it was fucking crazy news.
*  It's breaking fucking news.
*  What?
*  It was all over the place.
*  The reason why is because we spread the negative.
*  As people we've fallen in love with bad information
*  and bad conversation.
*  We're intrigued by it.
*  Well, it's a natural human instinct
*  because those are the things that can kill you.
*  Like from the days when we were living in small villages
*  worried about animals attacking us,
*  you had to be always worried about negative.
*  Negative is the thing you had to concentrate on
*  because that could take your life.
*  Positive was something that's great, that's good and all,
*  but really got to concentrate on negative.
*  And unfortunately, that human instinct carried over
*  into this time where we don't really have
*  the same fear of danger that we had before
*  for the most part, but we still concentrate
*  on these negative things.
*  We still concentrate on negative comments, negative stories.
*  These negative things carry more weight
*  because we have a natural inclination
*  to keep an eye out for danger.
*  It's like our human reward system's been hijacked.
*  It's been hijacked by social media,
*  this new thing that we're not prepared for,
*  reading anonymous written things that are negative.
*  There's a book called The Coddling of the American Mind
*  by Jonathan Haidt and he wrote about this with children,
*  about how many, especially girls,
*  so many girls are experiencing super high levels
*  of self-harm, suicide, depression,
*  all because of social media,
*  because they're writing things
*  and their friends are commenting on them
*  and people are anonymously saying,
*  you stupid fat bitch, and like,
*  ooh, it fucks with their head in a way
*  that other generations before didn't have to deal with,
*  before social media, there was nothing
*  that could affect them in this way.
*  And it's tough because there's gifts
*  and there's curses to it, of course.
*  Like there's an amazing benefit behind it
*  and of course now we're seeing the bad within it.
*  So what I encourage any and everybody to do
*  is just understand who you are.
*  Truly understand who you are.
*  Learn yourself.
*  Learn yourself.
*  Learn your pros and your cons.
*  Get your flaws, get them out the way,
*  but with you, not to nobody else.
*  This is a you and you thing
*  of the shit that you know you need to work on.
*  I'm telling you people,
*  when you really look yourself in the mirror
*  and you start to pick yourself apart by yourself,
*  there's only room for improvement.
*  It's easy to ignore your bullshit.
*  Also other people can't tell you things
*  you don't already know.
*  Fuck, you're 1000% right.
*  You're 1000% right, and that's what this is.
*  My audio book is not a live like me tutorial.
*  It's not a do what I did tutorial.
*  I would never do that
*  because I don't have all the answers.
*  All I have is stories and information
*  that you can now be privy to
*  that can allow you to make different fucking turns
*  on this road of life.
*  What was the motivation to do this?
*  Was there a one thing or was it a build up?
*  Me being one of the only black guys
*  in our entertainment space
*  because there's a handful of us
*  that get to look behind a curtain.
*  There's a curtain, there's another room
*  and there's a curtain and in that room is some shit.
*  You're like, god damn,
*  I didn't know y'all was fucking doing this back here.
*  I didn't know y'all was getting this type of money back here.
*  Y'all been doing this for how long?
*  This is how it happens.
*  There's a room that you get in
*  and the information and understanding that comes in it.
*  It's unreal, the stuff that you start to discover,
*  but it's a discovery.
*  It's a discovery.
*  You gotta stumble upon this treasure
*  of information and discovery.
*  And if you don't, maybe you're in the right environment
*  and you hear some stuff and you can ask some questions,
*  but nine times out of 10, it's not offered.
*  It's a search and find.
*  And when I was constantly in those situations
*  and I find myself saying, so how, but why?
*  Well, then what did you do?
*  Damn, after that, then what?
*  What the fuck did you, how did that even work?
*  I was in a room with Jeff Bezos and Robert Kraft.
*  This was the Patriots that won the Super Bowl
*  and we're in this little private room after
*  and Tom Brady is giving a speech thanking Robert for all.
*  Robert thanks Tom and I'm with my wife and a friend
*  and Jeff Bezos walks in and my friend go,
*  there goes Jeff Bezos.
*  I said, oh shit, I'm gonna go say what's up.
*  I said, that's motherfucker, I would love to pick his brain.
*  That's an interesting individual.
*  No, don't do that.
*  What do you mean don't do that?
*  Who said don't do that?
*  My friend, no, no, no, don't do that.
*  Why, what are you talking about?
*  Why are you gonna do that, Kev?
*  This room full of people don't look like the dude
*  that's thirsty.
*  Thirsty for what?
*  For fucking information, dick face?
*  Who got into like little fuckers back, for what?
*  For fucking information?
*  I wanna fucking say, hey, I wanna see my face.
*  I wanna ask him some questions.
*  I ain't gonna see this man no more, I don't know him.
*  We not on a phone number to phone number basis.
*  I'm gonna say what's up to him.
*  All right Kev, I'm just saying
*  and this environment is just chill, it's relaxed
*  and that shit start to click to me.
*  That's the problem.
*  Everybody's too cool.
*  Everybody's too fucking cool.
*  Everybody wants you to think that they know.
*  You don't know.
*  You don't know shit, we don't know shit.
*  There's one Jeff Bezos.
*  There's fucking one almost trillionaire.
*  Hey Jeff.
*  Come here man.
*  Hey man.
*  First of all, explain a trillion to me.
*  What is that?
*  How many zero, what is that?
*  First of all, do you know how excited
*  he must be to talk to you too?
*  Who knows, I'm gonna fucking find out.
*  I'm gonna fucking find out.
*  You know what I did Joe?
*  What?
*  Hey man, I'll be right back.
*  Babe, come on.
*  Took my wife with me.
*  Hey Jeff, I'm Kevin Hart.
*  How you doing man?
*  Hey Kevin, how are you?
*  Jeff, this is my wifey Nico.
*  Hey, hey man.
*  I admire you.
*  I don't fucking know anything about that world and death
*  but I admire you.
*  I admire you for being a guy that fucking created
*  and accomplished some shit that is a phenomenon.
*  I wanna shake your hand.
*  I would love to talk one day.
*  Kev, hey man.
*  Good meeting you.
*  Quite sure we'll bump past one day.
*  Hey, if we do or don't, you gonna remember this.
*  I just wanna tell you I admire you.
*  I don't need shit.
*  I'm not asking for anything.
*  But what I did, I set myself up for another conversation
*  for when I got the opportunity.
*  You're talking here but I'm gonna come over man.
*  I admire you.
*  I wanna fucking ask you a bunch of questions
*  about this Amazon shit and ask you how you came up with it.
*  I don't think this is the time or place
*  but I want you to see my face.
*  Have you ever seen the photo of him sitting at his desk
*  and there's a banner behind him,
*  a plastic nylon hanging banner that says amazon.com?
*  It's in the 1990s when people were like,
*  what the fuck you doing selling books on the internet
*  and this is a shitty looking Ikea desk.
*  Look at this, look at him.
*  This is him here.
*  Look at this, amazon.com.
*  And marker.
*  Yeah, it looks like spray paint.
*  Spray paint, look at this shit here.
*  Look at that shitty bullshit desk
*  that dorky looking dude.
*  Look at the cords.
*  Yeah, now he's off buff and jacked and shit.
*  Jesus.
*  Now he's a savage that's basically
*  conquering the business world.
*  Richest man, well, richest man publicly.
*  I think there's a bunch of them oil billionaire,
*  trillionaire dudes.
*  That's got some shit too.
*  They don't have to.
*  Yeah, they just shut up.
*  They don't wanna say anything.
*  Either way, I was in a room with that man.
*  I didn't, there wasn't a level of cool that I had.
*  That would keep me from just going and saying hello
*  or asking a question for that matter.
*  And it's being in those spaces that intrigued the thought.
*  I was like, dude, this is what I'm gonna do.
*  I'm gonna do my part.
*  I'm gonna do my part and say it.
*  I'm gonna say, hey, when it comes to producing
*  and production, here's what I've done.
*  Here's the walls that I've hit
*  and here's where it's really hurt me.
*  But here's what I've learned
*  and here's why I do it this way.
*  My ambition is fueled from possibility.
*  I'm giving you all this shit.
*  I'm giving you all this shit.
*  What I'm gonna do?
*  I'm gonna die and take it with me?
*  I'm gonna keep it in the coffin with me?
*  I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.
*  I'm gonna do it.
*  I'm gonna fucking give it.
*  Well, also the possibility that some young kid
*  could listen to this audio thing,
*  listen to you talk about these things
*  and then one day succeed and run into you
*  the same way you ran into Jeff Bezos.
*  Oh my God.
*  Run into you.
*  Kevin Hart.
*  Oh my God.
*  I got where I am because I listened.
*  I listened to you talk about your life.
*  I listened to you talk about your fuck ups
*  and you made me feel like you were human.
*  Like I thought you were just Kevin Hart.
*  Like when people see you, you're Kevin Hart.
*  You're walking the red carpet.
*  You're in Jumanji.
*  You're all over the place.
*  Fucking comedy specials for 50,000 people
*  in arenas and shit.
*  People don't know that you're a human.
*  You don't seem like a human
*  because you're not like a human that they know.
*  But when you talk and you talk about your life
*  and some kid might just get a spark off of that
*  and blow that spark, make that ember flame up
*  and take over and next thing you know,
*  you're running into that person
*  at some other Super Bowl party.
*  I can't even, dude I can't even tell you that's the,
*  for me that's what it's about.
*  Yes, yeah.
*  That's what it's about.
*  You're offering fuel.
*  That's as strong as anything else.
*  Yeah.
*  That's impact.
*  It's gonna impact some people.
*  There's gonna be people that don't have room for it.
*  They're all closed up.
*  It's like a cup.
*  There's no room in their cup.
*  They're full of their own shit.
*  It's not gonna get in there.
*  There's other people.
*  They're gonna have a spot for you.
*  They're gonna have a spot
*  and you're gonna make that engine better.
*  You're gonna make the whole engine of their life better.
*  There's things that I think about all the time
*  when I'm working out or when I'm tired.
*  I think about inspirational things that people have said
*  and they get me through.
*  The shifts in my mind steals me up,
*  makes me think about things in a different way
*  and I can accomplish more because of those thoughts.
*  I can accomplish more because of that energy
*  that some person, and you did that to me, man.
*  You did that to me the last time we had a conversation.
*  I remember leaving our conversation going,
*  that motherfucker is motivational.
*  And I got a lot of text messages from a lot of friends
*  and a lot of people that was a great one.
*  But it was a shift.
*  Like when someone is really getting after it in their life
*  and you're around them, there's a shift in your own life
*  and it's a tangible thing.
*  It's like if you could see it on a meter,
*  it's almost like your meter goes up and you feel it,
*  but you don't quantify.
*  It's not something you put on a scale.
*  It's not something you'd see on a meter, but it's real
*  and you gotta believe it's real and know it's real.
*  And when you're doing this,
*  when you're putting out this audio book
*  and even these conversations that you put out,
*  people know what you've accomplished
*  and you put these conversations out, it resonates, man.
*  It's so valuable.
*  Did you watch the Jordan doc?
*  No, I didn't.
*  You gotta watch the Jordan doc.
*  I know everybody's been telling me that.
*  No, you have to.
*  I know I have to.
*  You have to watch the Jordan doc.
*  Okay, I'll watch it.
*  Listen, because he's an alien.
*  He's one of us.
*  He's one of those aliens that other aliens identify with
*  and for people listening, when I say aliens,
*  you know it's a metaphor, people.
*  It doesn't mean that we're fucking embracing aliens here.
*  Okay, I'll just get out.
*  I get so much shit for everything I say, okay?
*  It's a metaphor, okay?
*  But he's different.
*  He's fucking different.
*  And what this shows you is how different MJ was.
*  That man was a fucking winner.
*  He was a winner.
*  And that's it.
*  Like that's it.
*  MJ won.
*  There is no other conversation.
*  When you watch this doc
*  and you watch how he approached his days
*  and why he approached it and the things that he did
*  and his reason for doing them
*  and ultimately what he wanted
*  and what his priority and what his goals were,
*  you go fuck, he did it.
*  We know why he did it.
*  It's not a coincidence that he's a champion.
*  It's destiny.
*  There was no other option.
*  It was champion or bus.
*  There was no six time MVPs, All-Star
*  and the defensive player of the year
*  and most likable player in the league
*  and most markable, no, no.
*  If it's not a champion attached to my name
*  with several fucking trophies attached,
*  there is no other conversation.
*  And you motherfuckers around me,
*  if you do not understand why I am the way I am,
*  then this is not the place for you.
*  Do your job.
*  I've never heard Michael Jordan talk
*  the way the documentary showed him talk.
*  Do your fucking job.
*  When I pass you the ball, hit the fucking shot.
*  That person now has to get better
*  because I'm so nervous that if Mike passed me the ball
*  and I missed this fucking shot,
*  I'm never gonna get a shot again.
*  Yeah.
*  Do your fucking job.
*  When Mike is talking to you like that,
*  I thought we was just playing basketball.
*  I thought I was out here having a good time.
*  Oh wait, this is my job.
*  This is my profession.
*  I'm supposed to do this, this and this.
*  If I don't do this,
*  I'm failing at my job.
*  You see these players today
*  and you see the way that they are.
*  I promise you man, rest in peace Kobe Bryant.
*  Every bit of the same.
*  They give my guy LJ Flack and shit.
*  I promise you LeBron James is nothing short of that.
*  I promise you these people that are winning,
*  fucking win because there is no other option.
*  You have to watch this doc and Joe,
*  you gotta text me after.
*  Okay.
*  Text me after and just go, holy fucking shit.
*  Holy shit man.
*  I get it Kev.
*  The fuel that you're talking about in that meter,
*  I promise you your meter, fucking,
*  I got it after the doc, I got up.
*  Where my laptop at?
*  I got it.
*  Shit, I'm over here watching the doc.
*  Let me think of what the next thing is.
*  It instantly, instantly fuel.
*  Fuel, instant fuel.
*  Last time I felt that was the Tyson documentary.
*  That was strong.
*  That was strong.
*  Dude, there's a time when he's talking about
*  walking into the ring, as he steps in the ring,
*  all the nervousness, all the things going through his head
*  and that is his confidence builds as he gets towards the
*  ring and he steps through the ropes, I'm a god.
*  When he says that I'm like, holy shit.
*  My cook pumps are popping up, I was like, oh my god.
*  That's the Doseckis man to me.
*  That's the Doseckis man to me.
*  It's crazy he's fighting again.
*  That is the Doseckis man to me.
*  The most interesting man in America.
*  Mike Tyson is that.
*  There are so many different levels
*  and pieces of death to Mike Tyson in his story.
*  I mean, it's one of the strongest docs I've ever seen.
*  Well, he's one of those guys, one of those super winners
*  that just, I mean, when he was young,
*  I mean, everyone knows the story, but if you don't,
*  he was basically had no love in his life
*  until he met Custamato and Custamato became a father figure
*  but also Custamato was a hypnotist
*  and a psychologist in a lot of ways
*  and a fantastic boxing coach as well
*  and took this young kid and showed him
*  that you're gonna get love from accomplishment
*  and you're gonna conquer and you're gonna become
*  the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time.
*  And through his tutelage, up until the moment that he died,
*  Mike Tyson was just a phenom,
*  a thing that we had never seen before.
*  He was the pit bull with no leash
*  that respected one person
*  and anybody else at any given time
*  feared the fuck out of this pit bull
*  because nobody else knew, hey man,
*  who's, what is, hey, somebody gotta get this,
*  hey, who, what, what is this with, who, who?
*  Until this day, if I see Mike,
*  there's a little nervousness for no reason.
*  For sure, he's terrifying.
*  It's not like he's coming in with this thing,
*  like I'm killing everybody, no, but there's a-
*  No, he's gentle.
*  He's the most loving man in the world.
*  You talk to him, you saw him spoken
*  but there's still a little thing like,
*  hey, is Mike gonna hit me?
*  My friend Kevin Lee said it best,
*  Kevin Lee fights for the UFC,
*  he said that when he's sitting next to him,
*  he goes, he goes, that's a lion.
*  He goes, I'm sitting next to him,
*  like, is that Mike Tyson?
*  He goes, that's a lion.
*  He's like, he's sitting next to Mike, okay?
*  I hope everything's cool.
*  Oh my God, this fight, man, I just,
*  wish him the best, I know he's back to training and stuff.
*  You just want him to be safe and healthy in his time,
*  but that's a man I don't ever count out,
*  but goddamn, seeing him just put up
*  those little displays of-
*  Terrifying.
*  Of fight, it's what?
*  It's heat- Terrifying.
*  Heat-seeking missiles coming from his shoulders.
*  Well, not only that, he wasn't doing anything,
*  like, a year ago.
*  When I had him in here for the podcast,
*  he said he didn't want to stoke his ego.
*  He didn't want to work out.
*  He goes, because if I work out, my ego fires up.
*  There he is.
*  Look at this, look at this shit here.
*  But, you know, that's interesting,
*  but that's just shadow boxing.
*  What's crazy is, he's training with Rafael Cordero,
*  who's one of the best MMA trainers,
*  one of the best striking trainers in the world.
*  He came from a legendary camp out of Brazil,
*  Curitiba, Brazil, called Shoot the Box.
*  It's like the legendary team of marauders from Brazil.
*  They were like the golden glory days of pride.
*  Pride was a competitor to the UFC,
*  was defined in a lot of ways.
*  The glory days were defined by this one team from Brazil
*  that Rafael Cordero was a part of.
*  And then that guy training Mike Tyson now,
*  and he's been super successful
*  training mixed martial arts fighters too.
*  But I found it very interesting that Mike chose
*  to train with that guy, and to see the way
*  they're going at it.
*  I mean, he's not boxing, he's trying to destroy motherfuckers.
*  Listen, I respect the trainer.
*  I respect the trainer for standing in the way of that shit.
*  Yes.
*  Like that's one accidental oops.
*  Missles.
*  Just missiles are coming right in his head.
*  Boom, boom.
*  Boom.
*  You gotta just bow down.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know what, man?
*  We're still in the presence of greatness.
*  And as people, I don't think we should ever forget that.
*  Well, what's crazy is he's 53 years old,
*  he's doing this, and he's only been doing this again
*  for like less than a year.
*  So it's only been like four or five months
*  that he's really been training hard,
*  and everything's just coming back.
*  I mean, I wonder, I wonder what it is.
*  I wonder if he just was bored.
*  I mean, I really wonder, this is the crazy shit.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I mean, if you saw that guy.
*  If you saw that guy training and he was a 22 year old kid,
*  you're like, man, this motherfucker's gonna be something.
*  Because he's just got an intensity
*  that you rarely see from any fighter.
*  There's a fury that burns inside of him.
*  You can't manufacture that.
*  You either have that or you don't.
*  And he found a way to reignite it.
*  Reignite it.
*  I swear you beat me to it.
*  But isn't that what we hope for?
*  We hope that we get.
*  I think at that age 50, that's a very pivotal,
*  how do you say that word, Gus?
*  Pivotal, pivotal, right?
*  That's a very pivotal word, pivotal word.
*  Pivotal point in your life.
*  Because from when you're born to 50,
*  you're, that's, okay, all my years of fun are out the way.
*  My craziness, my growth, my maturity.
*  And now I'm supposed to start to be a little complacent.
*  And I'm now at that hill where I'm looking
*  on the other side of life.
*  Now it's time to go on that other side.
*  And when you're on the other side,
*  even if you're still on a high about living
*  and about career and everything, you're on the other side.
*  It's a different thing when you're on the other side.
*  I made it here.
*  Now how many more years?
*  It's a blessing to get more time after this
*  because I made it to the top.
*  And now, you know, on this other side, is it relaxing?
*  Is it not?
*  Am I comfortable?
*  Am I a little depressed that I'm getting old?
*  Am I not?
*  Whatever those emotions and feelings are, they're real.
*  And a lot of people experience it, have them.
*  So to find something else to make you go,
*  I'm ready again.
*  Will Smith did it.
*  Will Smith kicked in.
*  Yeah.
*  Will Smith, something clicked.
*  Something clicked on Will Smith.
*  For years, Will Smith wasn't around.
*  Will would talk to you.
*  Will would talk to you, Will would tell you.
*  But something clicked and he said, at this age, at 50,
*  I'm gonna go get it again.
*  I'm gonna go after it again because I can.
*  Like it's something in there that Will Smith realizes
*  that he has.
*  And at any given moment, I can.
*  And that's what Will Smith showed us.
*  Will Smith wasn't on social media.
*  Will Smith wasn't in this, you know, in the Generation X,
*  you know, he wasn't in our face.
*  He wasn't up in the fucking vlogs and shit and YouTube.
*  On a day to day, he didn't have more movies coming out.
*  It was very far-future in between.
*  And then he said, I'll do it when the fuck I want.
*  And he turned it on.
*  30 something million followers,
*  40 something million followers, whatever.
*  Vlogs on YouTube, I'm on Snapchat.
*  I'm on it all, Twitter, TikTok.
*  I'm gonna show you how to do it.
*  I got my own team.
*  We showed you guys a new way to do this shit.
*  I'm producing it different than it was.
*  I'm back to doing movies.
*  Here's my new movies.
*  We're using a new technology.
*  Jimmy Nye, man, young me, old me.
*  He's fucking doing what he wants because he said he can.
*  Everybody doesn't have that.
*  Everybody can't do that.
*  You got a lot of people to try.
*  But they don't do that.
*  You don't go from being number one and saying,
*  I'm not gonna do it and I had some failures or whatever
*  in here and it fall off.
*  Fuck it, I'm ready to be number one again.
*  That's some of our favorite stories though,
*  someone who comes back.
*  Dave Chappelle's a perfect example of that.
*  I can do what the fuck I want.
*  Not only that, Dave did it in a legendary way.
*  They offer him all this money to do this
*  Comedy Central show in a different way.
*  They want him to change it and tone it down.
*  They wanna make it more suitable for advertisers.
*  Too many voices.
*  And he's like, you know what?
*  I'm just gonna go to Africa.
*  I'm out.
*  He just went to Africa.
*  I'm out.
*  Just took off and then came back and said, I quit.
*  And then stopped doing stand up.
*  He was doing, I don't know if you know,
*  he was doing stand up in a park in Seattle.
*  He'd show up with a fucking box.
*  And just do it.
*  Plug a microphone into it and just start doing stand up
*  and people would gather around like,
*  what the fuck is happening here?
*  No, he didn't want any money.
*  He would just show up at shows.
*  If he wanted to do a show, he would show up
*  at a comedy club.
*  No money, just show up.
*  Do a show after the show is over.
*  Are you ready to laugh?
*  It's a great Dave Chappelle story.
*  I'm in Seattle.
*  I think I was in Seattle.
*  Sold out.
*  Got like some arena fucking thing I'm doing in Seattle.
*  And we got two shows same night.
*  We do about 30,000 people, right?
*  Just fucking great day in Seattle.
*  I get word that Dave Chappelle is in Seattle
*  and Dave Chappelle randomly put up a theater show
*  and he's performing.
*  Tonight?
*  Yeah, he's performing tonight.
*  Call Dave.
*  Dave, are you fucking in Seattle?
*  Yeah.
*  When'd you book a show here?
*  I would have fucking came, dude.
*  I'm here.
*  I'm at the theater.
*  Oh, I didn't even know, man.
*  What'd you meet?
*  Dave, I'm at the fucking arena.
*  I'm gonna see if I can get down there to you.
*  All right, man, yeah, I just put them up.
*  What time you think you gonna get here?
*  I don't know.
*  After my show, I'll push the time back, man.
*  Dave, what?
*  Push the time back?
*  What did you put on set?
*  I don't know, man.
*  I just tell them I'll do it and I'll show up, man.
*  I just call them, tell them I'm gonna push it back, man.
*  I get to the fucking theater.
*  I rush after our show.
*  Dave has a trailer
*  and there's like a little motor thing
*  on the back of the trailer.
*  It's like a little bus,
*  a fucking motor trend like bus
*  and then there's like a little,
*  the things that you pull shit in attached to it.
*  I said, Dave, what are you doing here?
*  He's like, I don't know, man,
*  we've been doing cross country.
*  Taking our bikes, man, we're riding cross country.
*  So I just, when I need money, I just book a show.
*  I just tell them.
*  I said, what?
*  What?
*  What?
*  What?
*  What the fuck?
*  He's so different.
*  He's so different and he's so him,
*  but the freedom.
*  Dave has a level of freedom.
*  Me and Chris Rock talk about it, man.
*  No one's like him.
*  His level of freedom, I've put myself in his place.
*  I got the corporate relationships
*  and the CEO hat and the companies.
*  So I can't do certain things
*  because the consequences aren't just for me.
*  It's for the people that are underneath this umbrella
*  if something were to happen.
*  It's, I have to be, I have to be responsible.
*  I have to understand that it's not just about me.
*  And I'm envious and jealous of Dave's ability
*  to go and be free as a comic
*  in the times where we desperately need to be.
*  Yes.
*  We desperately need to be and Dave can be.
*  And I bow down to him.
*  I called him.
*  I don't give a fuck about these numbers or anything I got.
*  Dave, in my opinion, you're the goat.
*  In my opinion, your last special
*  has allowed you to surpass the Richard Pryor.
*  In my opinion, Dave Chappelle,
*  I got to witness do groundbreaking,
*  controversial movement as a comedian
*  in the times where comedy was being frowned upon.
*  Comedians were being held accountable
*  for doing what we thought we would never be ridiculed for.
*  Right.
*  The one person that stood on a pedestal
*  that got the attention that no others can get
*  outside of a myself, a rock, a Seinfeld,
*  he said, in the time where the fucking fire is the hottest,
*  I'm going to do what nobody else will.
*  You gotta fucking applaud that.
*  He stood up for comedy.
*  He stood up for comedy.
*  Whether you wanna see that or not, he did that.
*  Yes, he did it when there was the most pressure.
*  When it was the most fucking pressure
*  and when the times of, we can cancel you,
*  by the way, which is the stupidest shit
*  that I've ever fucking witnessed in my 40 years of life.
*  The whole idea of I can kill you today
*  with the goddamn click of a button, I can end your life.
*  By the way, this is a real feeling that people have.
*  I'm in control of your life.
*  If I want your life to stop and be over, I'll cancel you.
*  And that means you can't live no more.
*  This is how ridiculous it is.
*  Think about the meaning of council culture.
*  So you're saying that my life is over,
*  I can no longer survive or provide for myself.
*  Cancel.
*  I don't know, figure it out, you're canceled.
*  Dave Chappelle said fuck all that.
*  Do what you wanna do, I'm gonna do me.
*  That is epic, that is groundbreaking,
*  that is goat-like behavior.
*  So I bow down to Mr. Chappelle.
*  He's very important.
*  He's one of the most important figures
*  in the history of comedy.
*  Absolutely.
*  Because of the fact that he's willing to do this
*  when the scrutiny is the highest.
*  And also just his story,
*  the way he did it, the way he walked away for 10 years
*  and then came back and immediately went right to the top.
*  That is my brother from another mother, I love him.
*  I love him.
*  Chris Rock, Chris Rock, I'll give you one more.
*  Me and Chris Rock, we're at the Comedy Cellar.
*  I call Chris, hey Chris, come down to the Cellar, man.
*  I'm gonna work on some jokes tonight.
*  I'll see what you think.
*  All right, Kev, I'll come down.
*  Chris comes down, he says, yeah, I'm gonna get up too.
*  I got some shit I'm working on too.
*  So tell me what you think.
*  Bet.
*  I go on stage, Chris Rock sits in the back of the Cellar.
*  Get off stage, Chris like funny shit, Kev.
*  I say, yeah, you like it, right?
*  Got some stuff, got some notes.
*  He said, yeah, I'm about to go out.
*  I'm done, I'm sitting here, I'm watching.
*  Chris goes up.
*  Chris got some funny shit, fuck Chris.
*  Funny, I like it, man.
*  Chris have a nice conversation, go upstairs.
*  We about to eat.
*  Dave comes in.
*  What up, Dave, what you doing?
*  I was gonna go up.
*  Oh fuck, man, Chris went up.
*  We gonna come down and watch you, all right.
*  Dave goes on stage.
*  Dave does about an hour.
*  There's a moment where Dave is probably
*  at about 40, 45 minutes in.
*  Me and Chris both look at each other
*  and at the same time when I was saying the word,
*  balled up the material that we just worked on.
*  We fucking, without saying it,
*  without saying it, I ripped the page
*  that I had in my little book
*  and Chris just balled up his little fucking thing
*  and we were like, he's unbelievable.
*  We came in, crafted, we got some shit
*  that we wanted to fucking work on.
*  Dave just went up there and talked.
*  It's like he's living like a legend.
*  You know what I mean?
*  If you wanted to have a legend of a comedian,
*  you would talk about a guy who created
*  the greatest sketch show of all time.
*  I mean, it only went for two seasons
*  but when you talk about sketches like Clayton Bigsby,
*  when you talk about the Rick James shit,
*  these are so classic, they're unstoppable
*  and then he goes away.
*  He goes away like a fucking mountain man.
*  He vanishes, he's in a farm in Ohio.
*  You hear, where is he?
*  He's on a farm.
*  He got a fucking farm.
*  He's on a farm in Ohio, what?
*  But is he doing comedy?
*  Sometimes randomly, he just shows up.
*  He's at his barn.
*  He does this for 10 years.
*  I was in Denver, right?
*  And this was before his comeback.
*  I was in Denver and I'm doing standup
*  and I get off stage and I open the green room
*  and Dave's there.
*  I go, Dave, what are you doing?
*  And he goes, oh hey Joe,
*  I just decided to fly into Denver.
*  I go, you don't have a show schedule?
*  Nothing.
*  He goes, no man, I heard you were here.
*  I decided to fly in.
*  I go, do you wanna go up?
*  He goes, oh should I?
*  I go, fuck yeah, hold on a second.
*  I run back, people are leaving.
*  People are getting up.
*  I go, come back, come back, tell everybody to come back.
*  I go, Dave Chappelle's here.
*  And they're like, what?
*  They all come back, sit down
*  and he does 40 minutes and destroys.
*  I love the best part of that story is,
*  you wanna go up, should I?
*  Dave, Dave, you just took a flight to Denver.
*  Yeah, Dave, why not?
*  I guess.
*  So then he takes me out.
*  We go out on the town to all these fucking
*  spots I didn't even know existed in Denver.
*  He knows where all these after hours places are.
*  You go behind an alley, you knock on a door,
*  they open it up.
*  Everything's velvet lined, there's a small private bar.
*  He's one of one.
*  He's one of one.
*  One of one.
*  One of one.
*  This is what the fuck it should be.
*  You see, this is us embracing.
*  This is us embracing.
*  We're embracing someone.
*  Embracing, there's nothing wrong with that, world.
*  It's important.
*  There's nothing wrong with embracing someone
*  as doing fucking what you can deem as great shit.
*  You're supposed to.
*  You're supposed to.
*  You have to.
*  You have to, it's part of the thing.
*  You have to.
*  You have to.
*  You're supposed to.
*  Sing praise, shower praise on people
*  that are doing it the right way.
*  No one's ever done it better than Dave.
*  He's doing it the right way.
*  No.
*  And even, like I said, even the legendary story,
*  it's like he's like a character in a book.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  A mountain man.
*  He's like a mountain man.
*  He goes off to a farm outside of Dayton, Ohio.
*  Who the fuck does that?
*  By the way, it tells me,
*  Kev, you gotta come down to the farm.
*  Dave, I don't, what?
*  No one has that kind of time.
*  Dave, I don't wanna,
*  what do you want me to do down there, Dave?
*  What do you want me to do?
*  You gotta come down, man.
*  It's a good time.
*  We're gonna have a good time, man.
*  It's a barn, fires, music.
*  Dave, it's a farm.
*  You gotta promise me.
*  All right, I'm coming, Dave.
*  I fuck it.
*  I like literally, I can only hope
*  to be remotely close to as creative as he is
*  at that point in my career and find this jello.
*  Like he's in an amazing jello right now.
*  He knows who he is, right?
*  And he's not compromising.
*  And no one can tell him any different.
*  He is who he is.
*  I mean, he's unapologetically himself.
*  And he gets it.
*  Part of his brilliance is not just being
*  a brilliant observer and a brilliant orator
*  and a describer of life,
*  but also in being who he is perfectly.
*  Like he doesn't have any conflict in being who he is.
*  He knows who he is.
*  He knows how to do it.
*  He knows how to do it right.
*  And he's okay with not having.
*  And when he walks on stage, man,
*  he strolls on that stage like he belongs there.
*  He's okay with not having.
*  He doesn't give a fuck.
*  You know Eddie Murphy?
*  I've met Eddie Murphy.
*  I don't know him very well,
*  but I knew his brother Charlie very well.
*  Listen, Eddie, we had a dinner one night
*  and it was Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, me,
*  Chris Rock, Chris Tucker.
*  Holy shit.
*  And Dwayne Wade, Gabriel Union and Usher, hey, Kay.
*  So we're at this dinner and me and Chris was like,
*  yo, we should get, let's just put a dinner together
*  where we all just come out.
*  Because me and Chris love to fucking just hear Eddie go.
*  Like Eddie is pound for pound the funniest person
*  you can ever be around.
*  Like effortlessly, not trying, just in story.
*  This dinner goes down in history
*  is the funniest night of my life in conversation.
*  And you got to see comics be in awe of one another.
*  You got to see us appreciate each other.
*  Like everybody talked in it.
*  This wasn't a one up story.
*  This was a conversation.
*  But you saw why the goats were.
*  You saw why the goats were the goats.
*  You clearly saw that I was young in class
*  and I'm the guy that's coming up in the rear
*  and I'm like, I'm happy to be there.
*  And I'm like, man, I'm fucking smiling.
*  Air to air, man.
*  Look at that picture.
*  There's a picture of it.
*  Holy shit.
*  I'm smiling air to air.
*  Damn, Jamie, skills.
*  I'm smiling air to fucking air.
*  And I remember there was a moment
*  where we were talking and Eddie would say something
*  and then Chris said, like, come on, man,
*  you know damn well, Eddie, anybody doing that.
*  And then you'll fucking hear Dave, shut up.
*  Damn it, Chris, which rock.
*  And then I'm just there quiet.
*  I'm just fucking quiet.
*  And then I would have moments where I would tune in.
*  But literally you saw why the goats were the goats.
*  Wow.
*  I'm telling you, one of the most epic dinners,
*  I have this picture framed at my house.
*  That's amazing.
*  Framed in my fucking house.
*  God, I hope Eddie comes back.
*  I know he's been talking about it.
*  He's been talking about it.
*  Did you see that one thing that he did?
*  There was some sort of an award show
*  where he came up and talked on the podium
*  and he was doing material
*  and he was talking about them taking away
*  Bill Cosby's degrees.
*  No.
*  You never seen it?
*  No.
*  Jamie, find it, find it.
*  Recent, is recent?
*  It's like within the last couple of years, bro,
*  his timing is on point.
*  He has it.
*  He would just get up there right now and murder.
*  Well, you saw it.
*  You saw it also in his SNL sketch.
*  He did the one SNL sketch where he did the,
*  it was like the holiday family.
*  And it was like the black family
*  and his daughter brought the white guy home.
*  And it was the black family's reaction to it
*  because he was staying there over the weekend.
*  So Eddie was the dad.
*  But you saw his timing.
*  His timing was amazing.
*  It's still there, man.
*  He's still fucking Eddie Murphy.
*  We'll play this and we'll wrap this up.
*  We'll just end it on this.
*  Your shit is available on Audible.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Now?
*  Yes, sir.
*  Right now?
*  Go get it.
*  You're a brilliant person.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  I really appreciate you being here.
*  I fuck with you, Joe.
*  I'm serious, man.
*  I wanna say this.
*  I couldn't be happier for you.
*  And for all of your listeners, all of your supporters,
*  I wanna thank y'all for staying with this man
*  and riding with this man through the years
*  because to build something
*  and have that something mean something, that's valuable.
*  Dude, you serve a very strong purpose in today's time.
*  I'm a fan and I'm happy to call myself a friend.
*  I fuck with you, Joe.
*  I appreciate you.
*  I mean that, man.
*  All right, man.
*  Eddie Murphy, ladies and gentlemen.
*  Listen to this.
*  Bill, oh, no, Bill has one of these.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Did y'all make Bill give his back?
*  Yeah.
*  No, cause I know there was a big outcry from people.
*  They was trying to get Bill to give his trophies back.
*  You know you fucked up when they want you
*  to give your trophies back.
*  You wanna give his trophy back to him?
*  He should do one show where he just come out
*  and just talk crazy now.
*  I would like to talk to some of the people
*  who feel that I should give back my trophies.
*  Oh, so it's only a piece of it, huh?
*  The whole thing's on there, but it's Mark Twain's speech.
*  Wow.
*  Well, if we play more, they'll probably pull it down anyway.
*  That's good enough.
*  Oh my God.
*  It was brilliant.
*  Strong.
*  Thank you so much, man.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  eğ'
