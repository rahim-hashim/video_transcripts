# Joe Rogan Experience #1529 - Whitney Cummings & Annie Lederman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UXpbbX9-Wo)
*  Do do first of all how do you two not have a show?
*  But is that what I can't remember cuz it's been so long it's been like six months now
*  Was that what every night was like a lot of nights were like that
*  I just had the craziest like a circus just laughing constantly
*  We used to go to the back bar and crack each other up. That was the constant thing
*  Either in the back bar the back smoking area and everybody was laughing
*  Yeah, and you get like a low-grade depression when you're not around it
*  You forget for months and months and months and then we had one night. We're all like
*  Do feel like I had like a crush on the night like I kept thinking
*  We'd fucked for the first time
*  And is he thinking about me too?
*  I was texting with you guys
*  I got so emotional when I pulled up and then I walked into the store. I almost cried
*  I was like, I can't believe I'm here like it's just and then it just there's this week
*  It's not like any of like if I had been away for five months and I came back
*  I'm like, I can't believe I'm here to be great
*  But I was like, ooh is here gonna ever be here again
*  Yeah, we're gonna be what it used to be because it didn't fit
*  There's no reason why it shouldn't be if we could do it the other night
*  Yeah, I mean the way we did it the other night everybody gets tested you go and hang out and it's fun
*  And we have STD tests, but we do all of COVID unfortunately
*  My chlamydia killed my COVID so I'm good. They cancel each other out
*  We don't know right what if it's an annual thing it keeps coming back
*  I have a friend who got malaria and then he got malaria again when he got sick
*  So it had been dormant inside of a system my friend Justin Wren he runs fight for the forgotten
*  He does charities in the Congo. He builds wells for the pygmies and he's there all he got malaria three fucking times
*  And so he goes over there
*  He gets malaria like deathly ill comes back and then he beats it does all the medication then a long time later
*  He gets really sick
*  And when he gets sick the malaria kicks back in again, and he wasn't even in the Congo the mayor
*  Not to be forgotten this is a charity for me malaria has killed more people
*  Than anything that's right like anything ever than wars I my dad
*  Malaria he was born and his that he was born in Panama because his dad was stationed there
*  And he got malaria when he was a baby, but it never came up again
*  I think problems Jamie didn't we look this up didn't it didn't they say that I know I fucked this up that
*  Malaria has killed half the people who've ever died ever
*  Whoa
*  Something that's when we looked it up. It's been next Jags rated a little bit, but it's definitely killed a lot of people
*  Let's say a quarter if we say a quarter, it's probably pretty imagine that just let's say a 25% of all the people who've ever died ever
*  from bugs and killed by malaria
*  So they just I just put this on my Twitter on my Instagram that they released or they're about to release
*  Some fucking untold hundreds of millions of genetically modified mosquitoes in the Everglades
*  Or in the Florida Keys, I think who the fuck knows and what is this supposed to do?
*  I don't know you get some fucking
*  Delivering the vaccine I got scared I pulled away from it
*  Then I got a text from a friend of mine as biologists and he was like what the fuck are they doing?
*  You're scared now. I'm really scared. I saw you post that I was like maybe I should read the article
*  And then I was like readings are really challenging. Maybe I'll just go
*  Hornets like I still don't know what happened with the p-tape like I'm so behind every day is some crazy
*  Adrenalizing story think the p-tape is real and is it gonna come out like right before the election?
*  It does come out right before the election
*  But does it work now because of the mail-in thing like people are they're voting already, right? Right, right
*  I think we are sort of at a point where nothing fucking matters
*  We're in this sort of like nihilistic thing where it's like if a p-tape came out right now of Trump like peeing on someone
*  We just don't care. Nobody cares. I guess I like Trump. You aren't like I like him because of how he treats women
*  He doesn't pee on women. I love how women leave the room with him dry from your long as he didn't apologize
*  He'd be fine
*  Soon as you apologize, you're fucked you can't cancel Trump
*  It's like it's like in a car accident the first person to apologize
*  It's their fault so you got to just get out in the car accident
*  Just be like what the fuck man what the fuck was up?
*  But it is a gross thing when someone hits you and then they say that was your fault
*  You're like, oh never apologize. You told me that your dad taught you that right never apologize
*  Yep, which you told me after I got in a car accident
*  The one advice my dad gave me that was the best advice was when you're in a car accident never say sorry cuz you'll get
*  Blamed for it, but what if you actually actually did it then you should say sorry
*  If you hit somebody with your car
*  No you look at them and you go like I'm gonna sue the shit out of you
*  You missing a leg? I'm not paying for that
*  Don't you think you should say sorry if you're rearing someone? Of course. Yeah, I did that
*  I was thinking about you because you posted that irresistible
*  Dude I've read someone texting like a year ago and I got out and I was like
*  I know I need to have a consequence for this behavior because I was texting and driving
*  Well, you have to get the consequence Caitlyn Jenner. You have to become a man. You have to transition
*  Can you give me your doctor handy?
*  There's no consequences, that's how you avoid the consequences right because nobody even talks about the Caitlyn Jenner thing. Yeah
*  The joke where he's like he harvested the vagina of the
*  Such a Kurt joke
*  Wake up and be like fuck you guys
*  He's it's a travesty that that guy's not more well-known and every time I do podcasts with him, too
*  He's so he's funny on podcasts. He's smart as fuck. He's really well read. He's great
*  Yeah, his ideas are very unique funny smart
*  Yeah
*  Something that was so important at the comedy star the other night is that these last six months have sort of
*  Hoodwinked me into believing that like jokes are dead that we're not allowed to make jokes anymore
*  And because Twitter right sort of you know
*  We're hallucinating with all the shit
*  We're seeing on Twitter and blowing it up to be bigger than it should be but like as soon as I saw Tony Hinchcliffe
*  He's the best for that that little motherfucker will say the most evil shit
*  No, no, no, no, no, not Tony
*  I don't think we're designed to just be on the internet if you're just on the internet and not seeing human beings and making jokes
*  Right actual people you can be tricked into thinking that that shit's real
*  Well Stan Hope really said it best once he said I could quit comedy
*  But I couldn't quit comics and that's what the other night was like like I've had my little fix where I did a weekend
*  In Houston a couple of months or so ago, but it wasn't as fun as last night
*  Talking over each other it was just like amazing
*  But this the art form of saying shit you don't really mean and everyone knows it we all know like if you say something really
*  Gross to me. I know you don't mean it and I'm laughing hard
*  It's like it's understood and it's also understood that you're you're taking a big fucking chance with our friendship by saying this
*  Yeah, around me. Yes, because you trust me. It's like the ultimate trust fall
*  Crazy shit to you. You're not gonna abandon me or judge me and we're gonna be it's like a trauma bond
*  I've definitely trauma bond
*  Bond trauma bond I'm gonna name it. I'm gonna name it that totally should be a special trauma bond
*  Yeah, that's a great name for a special but um yeah
*  No, I've said some things to you where you've looked at me like and I'm like are we not friends anymore?
*  There's two things I said to you that I'll never forget and I like cuz I just say things when they come to my head
*  If I react that way it's because I have to react that way it's like
*  Do you think you have CTA CTE and like you could possibly like at one point like murder your family
*  You might do you want do you think I could and I was like oh, I don't know
*  But you know part of the fun is mock
*  It's really fucked up because like just what's been going on the last couple years
*  You know it's like I never feel more equal like when people want to talk about men and women
*  I never feel more equal than when a male comic is fucking pummeling me
*  They know I can fucking take it right you know you'll come all right back that's exactly that's what's fun about it
*  It's like they're not doing it to be a bully
*  They knew they're doing it cuz you want to spar and you can handle it like okay, bitch. Let's go
*  Nobody wants you to go like ow and then like sulk and walk away that
*  Everything thank you for not thinking I'm fragile, but it is funny when you just go like a little too far
*  I was like
*  She tweeted we were facetiming last night, and she tweeted a pic or Instagram a picture of it
*  And she goes Annie let him in you're a mess, and I wrote okay pink hair
*  Nothing I don't know I was like is she gonna get offended. I don't know some people have weird Achilles heels
*  You know some people have weird. I mean I'm doing the roasts all the time
*  It's amazing how you can accuse people of rape and say like crazy shit racist shit
*  But then as soon as you say like your dog's ugly like yeah
*  And that's you
*  Gross battle was really good for comedy really good. That's where Annie and I met the first time. Oh sure you talk about it
*  Our meet cute story we didn't start off on grade terms
*  It was it was okay though wasn't that bad you you texted me so fast after it was like it's so weird
*  When he comes just texted me, but you are intimidating. I am gonna say that there's something very intimidating about you
*  It's cuz you're showing your mid-truth
*  All different shapes of muffins it doesn't matter
*  You're confident that's one thing but
*  There's a fear that you could be mean so that's what people are scared of that you're confident, but you might be mean
*  It's like whoo I gotta tread lightly. I was the funniest thing is like you also dress you wear military garb you dress like I do
*  Like anti-semitic. I'm gonna be honest
*  Boots you know I just was like sneakers or boots Annie's dad didn't you love her no my dad loved me a lot
*  He just too much very mean no
*  No, but so I did it was when Jason Reitman was filming the roast battle for Sundance and
*  It was me against Mike Lawrence. Who's an old friend of mine. We did Mike's together and stuff and
*  You and Dane Cook were the judge and I remember coming out and being so excited that Dane was there because I had a joke
*  Written by I went I went I went
*  Day and I'm so I'm such a big fan. I'm so glad you're here
*  But I'm confused if you're here who's at the improv getting bumped by crystal, EO
*  He just went he went away. I didn't expect he was gonna go he went
*  He went like that was funny
*  And then he liked me afterwards
*  And I was scared cuz I was like is he gonna like tell me all my jokes suck now
*  He was cool, but then he said something else where he said to someone you know you're really you're really good
*  You're gonna be very successful, and I was like yeah, but just don't don't take financial advice from
*  His story that he told in your mom's house of how his brother stole his money is terrifying
*  Terrifying crazy well you said to me. I was saying I was like I'm when I'm rich
*  I'm gonna get a chef and you were like keep your circle small
*  And you're like you don't want a fucking chef you don't even want an assistant
*  Yeah, yeah when you when you have an assistant that means you do too much shit
*  Point and by the time you tell someone to do something something you could have just done it yourself
*  Yeah, you can get lucky I have friends that have had assistants that wind up being their best friends, and it's great
*  They're just a cool person that they met that I did a job
*  But I also have friends that got sued by their assistant and David Spade got tasered
*  Murdered by his assistant
*  David Spade has on his bedroom door a fucking a latch like a like a medieval wooden latch
*  That's so crazy like this guy, and he's a small man. He's a tiny little guy so that the fear of that must have been
*  Terrifying yeah, and his I think the assistant he told a story
*  He had taken like overdosed on Tylenol PM or something and if you take enough of that your body goes into shock and you
*  produce crazy adrenaline and has the opposite of a soporific effect or something really so the guy was like hopped up and nuts and
*  I think David had a gun under his bed and the guy took the gun out
*  I mean, why if you be careful you give the keys your house
*  I was gonna say be careful if you try to rob David Spade. He's got a gun
*  Make sure if you do just come in
*  Slow sneak under the bed is a water gun for his company
*  But also it's it's any assistant that wants to be a celebrity assistant wants what you have mm-hmm maybe right
*  Or maybe just think it's a good job. Yeah, it's generalizations are our business
*  They're fun, but you can have a nice assistant. You can have a nice secretary
*  You can have good people you work with like there's a lot of people that are comedy teams
*  And it works out great like Matt Stone and Trey Parker those those fucking guys have been yeah
*  Banging it out and making awesome shit forever. I've been banging like they're not
*  But you know it's like there's generalizations we always like to talk about comedy marriages they don't work out
*  But sometimes they work out yeah rich Boston Bonnie McFarlane rich false Bonnie McFarlane
*  Natasha Mosha yeah, well they work yeah Tom and Christina. There's a bit excited to see these kids
*  Yeah, they're gonna be hilarious well you have to be rich and Bonnie's daughter just turn
*  I think she turned 13 Raina. She is the fucking funny sometimes. She does their show with them
*  I've known her since she was a kid. I'm so you think I'm scary
*  I'm like your daughter's like a cunt in the good way like she's so funny. She's so cutting
*  She's but I see her and I'm like you got to be on your toes cuz she's the funniest sharpest
*  She's funnier than both of them. I imagine growing up in that house. Oh my god rich boss
*  Is one of my favorite jokes that we're probably not allowed to tell anymore
*  I
*  He had this joke. It's just like fucking kill me he go on. I don't mind fucking a girl on her period
*  I just pretend like I'm killing her
*  That's a perfect example like the reason why we're laughing is he doesn't really mean that
*  Yeah, that's the problem with writing something like that down in quotes you go these guys these fucking assholes are laughing at this like
*  Only cuz it's not real
*  Also the same people that are complaining about are the people that watch like true crime shit and literally
*  Masturbating and falling asleep to get like a light to a like beautiful tale of murder. Yes, see they watch CSI
*  They watch it's like all these things weird
*  How many of those shows there are tons people love it in the ones the really dumb ones like the CSI ones that are so clunky
*  Like at the end no disrespect, but you know I'm saying like they have to kind of have to be there
*  They're wrapping up a show in an hour. Yeah, but at the end of it
*  They're always it's always like and they catch the bad guy. Yeah, every time you like now I can sleep
*  Yeah, isn't that what was in that book irresistible that you were just posting about our brains are wired to need completion
*  I mean we have to get to the end of something even if you're watching a shitty movie if someone turns it off
*  I have to fucking know how it ends. Yeah, that's not edging with this movie
*  No country for old men was disappointing for a lot of people because the end you're like hey that guy is okay
*  He gets away. Yeah, fuck. That's a wild
*  That's a wild movie
*  I rewatched a lot of classic movies over the last six months because we haven't been able to do anything and I rewatched
*  That shit that shit is in sing that hair the weirdest part of the haircut is the craziest
*  Yeah, it's a disturbed. He is disturbing looking that dude is so good. I look like right now
*  That's me in ten years when I go full Joan Rivers, what is this name again?
*  Javier Bardem when I go full
*  One time I was at the Brea improv high as fuck like way too high and I'm sitting there just
*  breathing heavy and Joan Rivers show came on the television and
*  When you see someone with those fillers in their face and the ratios all off
*  Yeah, cuz it's like and then their faces and moving I was horrified right I was sitting there just
*  Barbecued watching the screen going. Oh my god. This is crazy
*  Well, I have a theory about plastic surgery if you're gonna like trim some off the nose you have to put it on your
*  Chin or something you have a certain amount of face meat and it has to stay on your face. No, you're right
*  There's a there's actually a golden ratio right right the Fibonacci sequence actually applies to your face
*  That's why when someone gets a nose job and you're like your nose looks good, but it doesn't look like it's your nose
*  Yeah, what's happening nature knows what it's doing. There's a certain arrangement
*  It's like whack-a-mole if you mess one thing up
*  You're gonna have to move everything else
*  But I was reading something about body dysmorphia about how we've gotten so dysmorphic about what we look like because we're always looking
*  At ourselves on screens and in photos, which is the reverse
*  How other people see us and they say that if you were to see yourself out in the world you wouldn't be able to recognize yourself
*  That's how dysmorphic we are. That's ridiculous because there's videos of you
*  Twin brother go right there
*  I know what my tattoos look like that's what my head looks like
*  Say ridiculous shit sometimes and it kind of sort of makes sense
*  But it doesn't like I remember reading once that the Native Americans when they first saw
*  Like Columbus and the people in the boats coming they didn't they couldn't see them because they didn't know what that was
*  I might get the fuck out
*  How do you like then explain UFOs right how do people see UFOs explain this would happen if you see
*  Coming to aliens
*  I
*  Think there's no way they didn't see the boats. That's a dumb thing people like oh wow they didn't see
*  They saw things that look like this thing they're gonna find out is called boats coming toward
*  500 years ago, how the fuck do you know what they saw?
*  I think the more fascinating thing about what you're saying is the fact that people are so willing to believe it
*  Which is why we're in this situation we're and people want to believe crazy shit
*  So when you see fake news when you see you're like yeah that happened like you want to believe something ridiculous
*  Let's also people say things like that like they couldn't see the boat so that you pay attention to what they're writing
*  Like oh this guy was saying crazy shit. Yeah, and then you go and pay like that's why people say crazy shit
*  There's a lot of people that are look when a lot of our friends
*  Online trolls they're doing they're saying crazy shit, so you pay attention. I mean that's
*  Addictive they know you get that adrenaline hit. I just thought they wanted me to know I'm a fat cunt
*  I'm a busted cunt
*  Has anything ever hurt your feelings in the comments if I'm on my period I'm filled with rage and then I go oh shit
*  I go to the red week guys. You still get your period. That's gonna be the red
*  I was like Whitney, you know, we're the same age. You're just way more successful than me like I
*  Think of you as being like 20 and I think of me as being like 71
*  Well, she had a like a blackout segment of her life that like doesn't count
*  Yeah, right. It's towards you being funny, but it doesn't count towards like life
*  I'm five years younger than I am because I just didn't have those years. Yeah, but there is foot it, you know, luckily drugs
*  Just drinking. Oh god. I got it. Got it. You know, but just with enough Jaeger
*  You can really been with you drunk before I bet never no I quit drinking
*  Right before I started right after my first open mic. I bet you're a
*  Matefasher, yes. I was fun. They called me fun girl Annie, which I just realized was an insult now
*  I was like that's right. I'm fine. I'm like, yeah, but you're fine
*  Did it like destroy your life? Yeah, I would definitely be dead now
*  I think if I didn't stop drinking and what did you drink Jaeger? I was I loved Jaeger. I liked whiskey
*  I liked anything that was like kind of like I would be either being a frat or like with a grandfather
*  Is it harder for clean comics when you're I mean clean meaning not sober
*  To this conversation again, you know
*  But when you go to a bar like if you're at the comedy store and everyone's drinking for me not one minute
*  That's not for one second. And it's funny. Sometimes people will be like is it weird
*  I'm drinking and I'm like you think I would relapse with you
*  By the way, if I relapse I'm like gonna throw a party we're going to an island it'll be fun
*  I've never understood how people can drink so much on stage when I see Stan Hope up there with a fucking thing of vodka
*  I just would just most of the time Stan Hope drinks bud light though. Oh nice
*  So it's like water like beer and he drinks it all day. Yeah, he's like, I just want to get fat
*  He's like, I'm not trying to get drunk. I'm trying to get obese
*  He likes to keep like a mild buzz all the time
*  I never want to my buzz
*  It's not a bad way to go like Chappelle does that too if you notice Chappelle will keep a mild buzz
*  And there's something about mild buzzes that really accentuate who gives a fuck comedy
*  Yeah, yeah, come on. I don't give a fuck like that buzz though is like so unattractive
*  I got I want to be I was like, let's take like a smoke break from my side
*  I was like, let's black the like bye bitch. I had no interest in being like
*  Just a little like me. I never drank wine until the pandemic
*  Board and like trying shit out
*  I was like what's my personality on this and this and I was like trying to find the best version of my personality
*  And it turns out it's Rosé Seltzer
*  It's white-clawed roofies
*  So I was doing definitely ketamine by the way, he's been day raping herself guys
*  She's been putting herself in a K holes and then getting right in that okay and masturbate
*  Ketamine is like prescribed though. It's prescribed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a nasal spray. You have it here
*  It's in my purse somewhere. Yeah, what's so funny about it is it's a nasal spray
*  But when I was going to raves and doing it we also
*  Nasally injected. I mean they're literally just this is a pretty trace amount
*  It's not a lot and I only do it like a couple times a week a couple times a week
*  Do a bunch of ketamine and stab ourselves like
*  That's got his cooties on it. It went through his arm. I don't even think we cleaned it good
*  Did it really go through his arm? Oh if I pushed it through and then you made you stop for a second
*  Yeah, we I hit a nerve the first time that I had a back out and do it again
*  I didn't want to do it. You want frog live? Yeah
*  He shut the frog out. He'll threw it up in my hand
*  Do you know that there's a book called eat that frog that's like about getting your work done in the morning?
*  Like eat it just like get it over like get the worst part done
*  Not even a sharp ice pick this is good did it make a sound at all
*  No, it just was like puncturing a steak and it wasn't you picked the spot
*  He kind of pointed me towards his arm like what area is a better place to go through but it was bleeding
*  I mean, do you think it would taste like elk? I don't think so. I think people taste like pigs
*  Cannibals would call people long pigs
*  That's literally a nickname. Did you notice that Blaine whenever he would have you do something? He would first like doubt himself
*  It's almost like a power of suggestion thing where he'd be like, no, no, it might be fake test it out
*  It might be fake member the frog. It might not be a real frog or yeah, this might be weighted. Yeah, see it right there
*  That's where I'm going through his arm
*  That's his hand that's his hand he's like pushing on the skin
*  It's tanned he's got a lot of money
*  Very poor or you're very rich if you're tan, it looks your face Joe
*  Is there something psychological about him doing that like touch it maybe it's fake make sure it's not fake
*  Um, yeah, I'm sure it does that with cards and I'm sure I don't know anything about magic
*  But I would imagine anything you do to overload the brain. Mmm, like if you are distract
*  Yeah
*  If you're sparring with someone or fighting one of the things you're doing is you're trying to overload their brain
*  So you're moving you do things you faint you fake like you're gonna punch then you kick them
*  There's but what you're doing is you're fucking with their heads you've given them too many things to think about
*  He's kind of doing that too. Yeah, I checked the cards out and he says things and he kind of doubts himself and asks you
*  If you're sure there's so many techniques involved, but he is a master amazing him doing that shit to law
*  He had so he did a card trick with one guy holding one of his wrists and another guy holding another wrist
*  Like he couldn't do anything his sleeves rolled up and he did a card trick for us. So cool someone
*  I know you're not supposed to say how magic happens
*  But I don't think that this counts is like but there was this guy that I knew that they're afraid are you in trouble?
*  Never go to the Magic Castle again
*  So fucking mad at me
*  It's coming for me, but sometimes they carve holes into their hands
*  Like flaps of skin and that's where they put the coins underneath like they actually yeah
*  They carve like little divots in their hands and that's how they hold the coins
*  How the fucking you carve a divot in your skin and then you let it heal
*  Yeah, there's like scar tissue and that's how they're able to hold the coins what crazy shit
*  I don't know really is there really no way to find out how magicians do their tricks
*  Well, you'd have to become a magician you have to yeah, they let you in you gotta get in the club
*  It's amazing blame was telling me that he has a friend
*  That's a card guy that will literally be playing with his cards 13 hours every day every time he's on the phone with them years
*  Yes, that's what I'm saying to him I was like the way you move your hands
*  It's it's similar to martial arts because we would someone's really good at a martial arts move
*  They have it just the pathway is just greased and slick and they're their neurons and when they do it just
*  It just goes and that was kind of him with his hands I was watching him move the cards around like whoa
*  Like someone who plays guitar really good
*  Or piano. Yeah, it's fascinating. Have you seen Kyle's Kyle Donegan's joke about where he's like, I'm not good at magic
*  But I'm good magician hands and he like
*  Time canceler
*  He goes back in time to cancel
*  Oh
*  He says a tweet he says like a mildly racist tweet like is it just me or does Indian food smell funny?
*  Throw himself into a woodchipper
*  So a team of incredibly diverse women scientists rebuild him and they put him back together again like the six million dollar man
*  Out of the woodchipper and then they turn him into a much more woke version of himself who's a time-canceler
*  So he's part machine and he goes back in time. Oh my god. It's so funny. It's
*  Fucking hilarious. It's so funny. Did I miss everyone? I know it sucks
*  It's weird to think that we saw each other every night
*  I know every night for 15 years and just talking shit having fun and boom it stops
*  So weird. It's like a family being broken up. I don't think it should have stopped. I really don't I don't
*  You know, I think people should be able to make their own decisions
*  Well, I think that there's ways to do it
*  We could do the weird social distance things, you know
*  It's it could either be outside or it could be you know
*  People are far back and spread out
*  It makes no sense that people are allowed to go outside have socially distanced meals
*  But as soon as someone stands up with a microphone and starts talking it is a spitty job though. I was watching you
*  When they changed the lights in the main room right before everything shut down and the lights were dark
*  I was watching you from the side. I've never seen so much spit. I was like
*  It's like when the sprinklers kids jump through
*  Droplet after droplet
*  Holy shit and then and I was thinking that and then I went oh my god when I catch that I know we really do deserve
*  I mean, I think we might deserve this
*  I've gotten the flu a couple of times from people's microphones one time I did a gig with Tommy and Tommy was sick as fuck
*  We're in San Francisco and we all got the flu because we shared a microphone together Davidson. No, uh, so girl
*  I started bringing a microphone with me on the road like a year ago because I kept getting fucking bronchitis from
*  I was like my opener everyone thought I was such an asshole and being a diva, but I was just like dude
*  I can't get sick
*  I did like 40 cities before I shot a special and it was so worth
*  I think that I I do think there's a lot of things that are happening in this that could carry over like I know
*  You think I'm master for pussies or whatever, but I like that
*  It's like a massive of pussies. There was a burr clip that went viral. I'm trying to talk him into talking shit
*  It was very funny
*  I want to get a cool one. I'm trying to think oh, I'm wait
*  Can I show you the masks that I'm making I was trying to Jaylanna would not approve of these

*  Yeti Tumblr yes, it's legit
*  It's very legit everything's Yeti involved with you. I every time I'm at the comic store and we're talking it somehow turns into you fighting
*  Bears I swear
*  We could be talking about fucking anything and then it's like three minutes in once you walk in I'm like and we're fighting bears again
*  Okay, I
*  Have a real problem we gotta get you a bear no, I don't want to have anything to do with bears
*  I'm scared of nature really yeah for sure. That's why you kill it well. No
*  Run with a taser. I know a taser now. I carry a big knife
*  Please don't run with a knife. I've seen
*  I have a little taser. It's not a bad idea, but I don't know I carry nun chucks I carry
*  Paper weights that fit on your knuckles you carry that little taser
*  I want to do it should we we have got to get more views the day
*  That be what if it just turns out that that's her Achilles heel
*  Falls over my she had so much problem. I've been having a week
*  Yeager this is gonna be fucking nothing so that's your thing so when they're like a mountain lion comes after you just fucking
*  Knuckle punch him with that thing just to protect her dogs from you
*  Wow
*  We're not talking about large overweight gay men
*  It wasn't that bad it's really not that bad
*  Well then I don't like dog collar
*  The bears gonna also agree that it's not that bad
*  But it's got I touch one little one and it's a lot of them you most likely if a mountain lion even if you have
*  A knife if a mountain lion gets you you're fucked. They're just too strong. Yeah
*  And they'll go straight for your face a chance you want to just be able to sink something into their neck
*  I watch the covenant every day. I go the covenant is that what was called the red?
*  I gotta go tase me quick. I need to come back from this. You know it's kind of based on a real story
*  Yeah, it's a little fucked up
*  I mean they switched a lot of shit around and change some things, but it's kind of based on a real story
*  Yeah, that scene was so brutal
*  There were all I mean that that that I that's the only movie
*  I had to like take breaks from while I was watching it like what they when his kid was dying
*  And he couldn't get up and save his kid that just like destroyed me
*  When Joey fell I always tell the story Joey fell and hurt his knee at the Comedy Store one night
*  And Whitney was with him he ended up being alright, but he just he just tripped or whatever
*  We're not gonna sue you comedy story
*  But he was like sitting on a on a rolling chair and Whitney was like and I went I rushed over anyone Whitney
*  Are you okay?
*  No, Joey walked into the kitchen, you know right when you walk
*  It's from the air fryer. I don't know what it is. It's so oily right there
*  Well, how many fucking orders of fries come flying through that?
*  That's all anybody buys is fries and chicken wings. It's all that oil. It's like a thick smegma
*  You can feel it you always catch me eating the worst food
*  I'm always like shoving my face and then Rogan walks in and I'm like
*  Pretzels the nuts. I'm just everything I'm eating nuts are good. Joey's in front of me and we're going through the side, right?
*  Joe is in front of me. I just see him go down and my brain just went Joey had a heart attack
*  Joey had a fucking heart attack he goes down his leg behind him
*  Some crazy shit where he did like a split and we couldn't figure out what even happened and he tore didn't he he tore something
*  I hear his ankle something like that. Not as ACL but something it was bad
*  Yeah, he heard walk. He couldn't get up and if you were having a stroke or heart attack, you don't know you're having it
*  So I he kept saying like I fell on my knee
*  I fell on my knee and I was just so worried that he never Jay Leno was telling us that story about Rodney
*  Yeah, so he's hosting the Tonight Show Ronnie does a set and he's like something's off he's like the call the paramedics
*  I think I'm in his timing was off and he was joking around kind of but he also knew that something really was wrong
*  So they call the paramedics to check Ronnie. He did have a fucking stroke
*  So he had a stroke while he was out there doing stand-up, which is crazy
*  It's insane someone die on stage doing stand-up. Yeah, two people have there was a British guy
*  I don't know his name who had a heart attack on stage and then there was years ago Jim Norton had posted a clip of it
*  There's a clip of it was it a live kind of variety show and there was this guy. I can't remember his name
*  I wish I remembered it but he
*  he was he was doing a bit in front of a
*  Curtain and live television and he passes out and falls out and they're all laughing thinking it's part of the bit and then you see
*  Them drag him out, but it's kind of a good way to go this guy. Oh Jesus. Where was this? Oh
*  My god, oh
*  That's how he really died
*  Yeah
*  You were like flexing your pecs or something in the kitchen of the comedy store and I was like I want to try and you're
*  Like you put your tits away
*  It is so funny because
*  People want to
*  Like go female comics male comics like I feel like we're so wouldn't we're together
*  We're so weirdly genderless like we're like brother and sister. Yeah, we're talking about the other night
*  It's a real meritocracy if you're funny
*  You're one of the clan and that's really all it is right I get that it's upsetting for people on the outside
*  I guess you're not a club. That's a friend of mine who is a
*  Philosopher very smart guy try to explain to me and he just completely independent of this
*  He's like you guys have to understand that you are little and he's not comic at all
*  Like this little group of people's like a walled garden
*  so there's a lot of people on the outside of it that see you guys having so much fun and
*  Doing all these things together and having each other on each other's podcast
*  And there's just an automatic feeling the inhuman nature to feel like you're alienated from that group
*  So that group somehow or another disrespects you that group is negative or bad or mean or this or that and then it compounds
*  Right, you know and then it becomes whatever find whatever the group is
*  Whatever your identity politics is if it's a right wing thing or a girl thing or a gay thing or a boy thing sports
*  Find they find a thing that makes you different from them and you negative and then positive and Europe suppressor
*  You're a bad person. It's outward. It's the outward locus of control, right?
*  So it's like I'm saying that my life is where I don't want to be because you made me feel this way or yes
*  It's interesting. Yeah, it's not like because if you think about anyone complaining about their place in comedy
*  It's like that's time to write jokes like yeah
*  I'm focusing on why you don't have a thing has none of it not you have no clue what anyone's story is
*  You don't know if it was easy or hard for them you have no but it is a hard job
*  It's not a comfortable job. Some of the people complaining have had specials. Yep, so you've had a chance
*  Yeah, you got on Comedy Central you got on Netflix. You got somewhere and people didn't respond
*  Yeah, that's not because the comedy store is filled with assholes. Yeah, that's not what that is
*  It's a fucking hard thing. Comedy is a hard thing
*  It's hard and honestly the harder the hallways are the easier it is on stage. So I was always so grateful when people
*  Laughed
*  That's what I tell is the most fun
*  He's so
*  He just shows up with a fucking plastic bag
*  It's got a small garbage bag
*  Greatest comics who ever lived that's what I love about comics is like no matter how great if you're a real fucking comedy story comic
*  You're still just like who you are forever forever if you stay with your tribe. Yeah, we're lucky as fuck
*  You know, we're really really lucky and it's weird now, you know
*  Like that night when we're all hanging out doing the comic store documentary was so much fun
*  But it also was bittersweet because I left when I was driving home. I was real emotional
*  Do you remember I kept gripping you going don't go I was like
*  Conversation over here. I wasn't a kale
*  Overdose
*  It's mental I'm like I'm a cloud bitch
*  There's gonna be an exposition Whitney Cummings drugging
*  I'm actually the pervious person in comedy. Listen, that was the only time in this whole
*  Covid period that I thought maybe I shouldn't go. Yeah, I'm hanging out with you guys. It was like
*  But I'm still going
*  Like this is so rare like how many grown adults like once you get to a certain age
*  You know your 30s you're with your friends like you don't have that kind of a life
*  Yeah, we can go and be with your peers just so unusual because like people that go on the road
*  Okay, if you go on the road all the time
*  It's just you and the people you go on the road with you don't get to converge at a home base
*  And that's what the store is. That's what's so different cuz like you'll be one place. You'll be someplace
*  And then we see each other
*  I'm there guys, by the way, I'm there the whole time and there's some working in the kitchen
*  Crazy about this moment cuz it's also like I've never felt more loved and accepted than I had in the comedy store
*  I walk I never felt like myself. I never felt accepted. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells
*  I didn't know why was it so weird. You feel that comfortable. We hate
*  My god's caddy daddy
*  So I didn't think you liked me for the longest time oh we should finish that oh, yeah
*  We should face that story. Yeah, so I do the the roast paddle Whitney's one of the judges and Whitney was like already pissed about something
*  Well cuz everyone was attacking my shiny ass face and saying that I had plastic surgery
*  Coming out, but I do I am launching a line of face oil. It's so funny. That's a perfect thing
*  It's KY jelly, but yeah, you can also fuck yeah
*  So she okay, so Whitney was like
*  She was like giving her assessment of my set or whatever and she's like she goes
*  She was I just feel like you need to smile more and I was like I was like smile more
*  I was like, what is this the streets like I was like and I was like in a hyper like fight mode
*  And I was like smile more. I was just like whoa streets of Albuquerque
*  No Philly suburbs of Philly first, but um so and then but Whitney you texted me like the next day like hey
*  It's when he Cummings. I'm sorry if I offended you or whatever. I was like I was like at the mall. I was like Whitney
*  I was like can I take a break? I was a working at Hot Topic and I
*  Was like a famous person's text me
*  No, but you texted me and it was like so sweet
*  I was like, don't cancel me. Please don't talk to a reporter
*  No, but it was very nice and then and then I like I just texted you back and I was like, yeah
*  I just whatever. Oh, no, and I went when we were when we were you were judging I went
*  When Whitney I was molested on spawn you're like we were all molested
*  I was worried that I was like silencing her cuz she was like, sorry Whitney. I'm listed
*  You are so funny. This is what I love about you
*  One time we were talking in the back at the we were in the green room and in the main room and you go
*  We're talking about rape or something and you go and you go you go
*  You go. I'm sorry. I'm not listening to anything. You're saying it's my I'm just thinking about whether my face is shining
*  I'm like, you know the answer bitch
*  And then you text me the next day you called me. You're like, I'm so sorry
*  Were you talking about being raped and I started talking about my face like you?
*  You come to a complete circle. You always handle you're always working whatever step that is
*  Always working it so no problems there
*  But I accidentally I was like looking at the thing you had texted me and I said something I like I actually sent a voice memo
*  to you talking shit on another female comedian
*  Like trashing a female comedian and it sent the voice like my finger hit and I was so embarrassed because it's just
*  Send it to me talking shit on another but you wouldn't have thought it was about you
*  I said her name and everything but it was just like
*  so crazy
*  That I was then voice memo on you being like this fucking bitch and then
*  Voice memos are odd because it's like I don't have voice mail
*  Like if you call me voice mail, it just goes to fuck you. It just like goes to the ether. Do you have voice?
*  Call back tonight tweet it
*  But
*  Those voice memos that people send they're odd because you have to listen right if you send me a text I can go
*  830 got it. Well spade always does the voice
*  I think it's cuz he doesn't want to put his readers on yeah
*  Well, it's also when you send someone a voice memo and then you see that they kept it
*  You're like why the fuck you keep that? Oh, you could tell if someone says kept or saved. That was the cutest
*  I
*  Have mission impossible to disappear I like that they go away
*  I think it's more bond. I will say though when you go
*  I feel like our text chains like comedians text chains if they ever get out we're all gonna get cancelled, but
*  We should all delete these yeah, there's one
*  We got so ridiculous
*  Famous I'm like you guys we can't text Joe certain shit. I know I think he's gotten overly famous to the point where we scan again
*  Yes, cuz there are times where I like want to send something
*  I'm like, I don't know Joe's on this chain like I feel like he's just too famous for this
*  You should see the shit sagura sends me Jesus Christ. So I played it yesterday for Nikki Glaser
*  It's this girl fisting herself, but in the most preposterous way were you like what well, there's there a way that's not
*  No, no, this this is this is a different is fisting real. Oh, I'll show you you can put your entire
*  You know what it is. It's this I realized it's putting all your fingers together. It's not like a let's go go in
*  Jamie you've been fisted tell us
*  Here you go. Thank you reactions for this video
*  Oh
*  Your face hold on hold on. Oh my god, it's me
*  Preposterous is the right word, right? Well, it's got a hurt. Why you punch it?
*  But a bruised-ass cervix anything that's fucked up like that Tom sagura will send it looks like the opposite of having a baby
*  I know
*  I'm like, I'm so going to jail for this. I think that's legal. I'm pretty sure that's legal
*  No, it's not you don't actually we have to be very clear. You don't actually get things that could send it
*  Florida has some wacky laws with that stuff
*  That's where they prosecuted certain like pornographers because they decided that it was you know
*  That's where they prosecuted the to live crew like it's flow like Broward County, Florida like they go after people
*  What is that? There was one guy was a really famous case and it really opened up a lot of people's eyes in terms of pornography
*  There was this guy who was like known to be like ultra disgusting
*  Like the stuff they did were like super abusive and like he would open up girls
*  Assholes like with a speculum and then piss inside of them and like crazy it kind of sounds like it would feel good
*  Wrong depends on how much beer he had wrong that's hardcore
*  Yeah, so that guy so he was found guilty on 20 counts of obscenity by Tampa, Florida jury
*  And so they they just they decide what's obscene and what's not obscene
*  It's like they can make a distinction between regular pornography and what they decide is obscenity and violates the law
*  So they put him in fucking jail
*  Jesus I'm like just so I don't know if there was
*  You see that's a thing. It's like if you're doing that kind of shit like are you making people sign releases?
*  Do they know that you're gonna do that?
*  Punching her fist into
*  She could get out of jail she could slide through she could like
*  She would kill it
*  Be fine
*  But you have to think like if you but then the other perspective is okay
*  What if this is your 18 year old daughter gets a Greyhound bus and meets this guy?
*  And she has no idea what she's about to do and she thinks she's gonna do just like a sex movie and this guy's pissing
*  Eyeballs and punch her in the face like there was all kinds of what I don't know if you punched her but you know
*  What the pee tapes are gonna be do you think the PTA is real? I just who cares
*  Have you ever had a guy try to pee on you?
*  No
*  But I had I had like one guy that I was like it was like the guy that we weren't we were just gonna like do
*  The things that we'd never done and we just end up not liking each other
*  So we didn't bang again, but I was like I would let you pee on do the things you've never done what like kiss on the mouth
*  We said he said I love you into my face
*  Numbers and our phones I had a guy pee on me once he was like really wanted to be on me
*  And I was like fine, and I started dying laughing. Yeah, well you guys in the bathroom or in the bed in the shower, okay?
*  Of course that's funny. He was trying to get on my it was like supposed to be sexual
*  It was like supposed to be sexual and I put them the sheen from your face
*  By the mirror
*  You know how when water gets on Vaseline
*  Damages retina
*  Soon as it started I could not stop laughing and I was so ridiculous ruin the moment you made the moment
*  That's the only thing good about that moment
*  Ruining that
*  She's pissing in your face
*  Just the fact that he wants to do it like the best way out is you making fun of him
*  And I can't tell if guys are doing it because they've seen it in porn or they're actually into it
*  It's gotta be like a pheromone thing or something so why did they want to be on us don't they want us to be coming on?
*  The face guys really want to do I think it's like a humiliation thing they want to degrade you I
*  Think they want you to like it
*  Interested they want you to want them to do like you're so over-the-top crazy sexual that you like think that that's why it exists in porn
*  I did the humiliation thing maybe sometimes I don't sometimes, but I think not always. I don't think it's just that I think it's like
*  Oh, yeah, I don't hate it, but then like once it happens. You're like this is like
*  Here's my thing if you're gonna come on my face you better not miss
*  You better not embarrass yourself that I don't want to have to bob and weave
*  With a tree
*  I'm Marshall all of a sudden it just weird when it's like not enough, and it's disappointing and I have to pretend like it's
*  Definitely dudes definitely jizz and have their dogs catch it. That's now that's
*  Just I just thought I know it's got for sure somebody
*  Is that funny that like this the amount of load is important well
*  I used to the same person that told me you can't recognize yourself on the street
*  It's David Blaine
*  No, but I used to hear these women there was like a show on VH1 these like rock stars wives who would always make their
*  Husbands who were like touring on the road
*  Come outside of them when they first came home to make sure they weren't cheating because they thought they wanted to see how much
*  Come they had but works
*  If you want to see how much your husband jerks off you should always leave the the build a tan lotion
*  Dark it is those are rookies
*  If you really need that
*  I'm sure you have some sort of but I mean there's jerking off when it's a compulsion
*  Loops
*  Because you know they do that to mules actually
*  What yeah when they when they want to extract sperm from them they actually stick a cattle prod up their asshole
*  And they just shoot oh my gosh, and I know that because of that's someone's job
*  No because of fear factor we made people drink donkey come did you ever drink the bad stuff you ever tasted
*  I didn't drink that but I ate a bunch of things I ate a cockroach up Madagascar giant hissing cockroach
*  I eat a tomato in your mouth. Oh destroyed is it just was all chewy
*  It tastes good at all. No, but it didn't taste bad. It's just a lie. It's a mind fuck. Yeah
*  It's a mind fuck. It's not it doesn't taste bad. It's almost like taste less
*  Legs are what get me yeah, but it's basically a lobster like a lobster is a bug. Oh, yeah, it's not much different
*  Right it really isn't it's all just in your head psychological
*  Yes, we think of cockroaches. I cooked a lobster the other day, and I felt so bad
*  I was like holding it
*  I was trying to get picture and I dropped it and then when I picked it up it was
*  Foaming and like shitting and pissing I like murdered it this is how a fear factor got canceled
*  They had to drink either they had to play horseshoes and either they drunk a giant glass of
*  Donkey cum or a dying glass of donkey piss
*  It's interesting like all the men wanted to drink the donkey piss the girls wanted to drink the come
*  Yeah, I know but I thought it was study protein like these girls are drinking giant beer steins
*  The belly button rings are so fun. I had to talk them into it. So I'm talking them through this
*  This this is where this is what got the show canceled this is when their twins
*  But were the ratings bananas no
*  They never made it on the air because TMZ got a hold of this and TMZ
*  Posted like someone from the I told this is the only time there's two times where I told them don't do it
*  The people that were running the show one time was they were bull riding and they were like don't worry. It's stunt bulls
*  I go that bull does not know it's a stunt. That's a fucking bull man
*  I saw the animal like that these people got on and one of them was a girl who was wait like she was like
*  95 pounds and that fucking bull launched her through the air like she didn't exist like like a pillow
*  That sucks that I'm mad at her for being 95 pounds. I'm glad she got hurt
*  The heel of the bull as he's kicking the hoof barely missed her head. She's like this like
*  Like within a foot of her head like if it kicked her in the head who the fuck knows what would have happened
*  So this is one where I told these people Mike do not fucking do this. It's crazy. Is this the girl?
*  What happened to her head she was really hurt she fuck up her back. No, she didn't land well. She landed really badly
*  I mean, but
*  Mister it's the back of the ham is what slapped into her luckily
*  I don't think that hurt her nearly as bad as the hoof would have hurt
*  I cracked my l4 falling off a horse just like that that was just that was honestly like rolling the dice
*  She was tough as fuck. She got out. She was okay. Looks thin. Yeah, she's a tiny girl
*  She's tough
*  She's very pretty I hope she's very svelte dude is fear factor was like the beginning of
*  the internet it was like you know to me like it was such a it was the first time like it was the
*  It was like TV never could come back from it
*  Like well could compete with it after that except the internet it was that was as far as they could take it
*  Yeah, it was NBC. That was weird as far as they could take it donkey come
*  I remember walking into the office going what are you talking about and they're going this what they're gonna do
*  They're gonna play horseshoes
*  I go is there a way that they can get out of drinking it totally if like they get a like if they land
*  What is it horseshoe when you get a shoe? What is it?
*  What is it when you hit the thing?
*  Possible if they get the if they ring around the horseshoe if that one
*  They could drink nothing and they said no, yeah, then you have to only drink with eight ounces
*  Like this is crazy. It is it's like a it's a bestiality rape situation where you're forcing them to swallow the sexual
*  This was juice. It's also a wild amount of calm
*  People keep getting canceled for like doing blackface and shit, but the network signed off on it
*  You're like why is this a person's fault?
*  It's like the network should be on SNL
*  So you know how many people have to sign off on that yeah?
*  Make it happen like 200 people said sure if you're around a bunch of crazy fucks like the comics at the store
*  And then one person says I think you can do it you're like we can do it
*  We're not the fucking people to be talking to about that, but even then I was telling them not to do it
*  I was like don't do this
*  Listen to me when I'm the voice of reason we're fucked yeah, this shows fucked
*  You can't have me telling you you're going too far, and they're like I think you're wrong. I think this is fine
*  I go it's calm did they go to you. This is all mental. It's all mental. No they didn't they were laughing
*  Did anyone hear oh yeah afterwards?
*  I saw so many people puke like a stunning amount of people puke
*  Is it true that there's contagious puking where if you see one person puke you automatically puke yeah for sure yeah
*  I used to get it really fear factor cured me of it. Whoa. Yeah when I was in high school if a kid puked in the hallway
*  I just
*  It's because there's something wrong like maybe even bad food
*  And you're with that person so maybe you ate that bad food too, and your body's like
*  Let's not take any risks. Let's just throw this shit up survival
*  Explained to me by someone who knows what they said that's exactly
*  It is like your body's trying to purge it because it's like oh this person's throwing up
*  There could be a bad bug or you know I could have eaten some bad food
*  You just block you just want to throw up to have you ever been thrown up on yeah
*  Yeah, people have hit me like hit my feet and shit pure factor
*  I saw who knows how many people throw I puked on the whole cast of the real world road rules challenge in Santa Fe once
*  I got so hammered do you remember they used to do that they would like have all the old alumni come were you on that show?
*  No, I was living in say I was a go-go dancer in Santa Fe and I
*  That's not stripping by the way
*  So I couldn't believe all the people coming into town I was like it's such a small town
*  So I was like holy shit like we had a lot of celebrities like Sam Shepard and like all these people
*  But I was like fuck that I want to hang out with the road road rules guy
*  So I was so excited, but I got the flu so instead of not going out
*  I just chugged day quill and then I was drinking like white Russians because I was like 20
*  You know so I puked like this milky
*  All over them, and it just happened to be a day that they weren't filming
*  Oh, I saw I puked all over them. I'm like why was this not being filmed to give me my first TV credit?
*  Oh shit, and then I was thinking about it was funny because later in that week
*  I was at a bar and all the the people were there
*  But the producers and stuff and the producers were like so what's your story?
*  And I realized they were like this is crazy bitch has got to be on the real world
*  She's good tell
*  Our new puck oh
*  My god puck is he dead I feel like all the people
*  One guy had AIDS in the beginning first one they become famous
*  And then you just cast out into the world they were the no talent first reality stars
*  I remember one time a friend of mine was at a restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina and one of the
*  Famous girls from the real world was a waitress at one of the restaurants
*  I took a picture of Senate to me, and I was like of course they didn't pay them anything
*  Yeah, they were famous and broke well
*  I remember there was a place that John and Kate plus eight the John guy
*  He was working at like a regular job. Yeah, people wouldn't leave him alone like you know I'm sure now. He's okay
*  But I remember I was in Hawaii once with my family
*  We went to this ice cream place, and they were like John and Kate were just here
*  Serving
*  Back when it was a show like when it was on television, and it's it's a weird kind of fame
*  Yeah, you know because they were really famous and now they're not well
*  It just stopped when people you a little bit have it too
*  I think because we're ourselves on stage we're not none of us are really that much of characters
*  I would say but yeah, but with the impractical jokers when I hang out with Sal
*  From impractical people come up, and they think they know him because of his personality
*  They'll be like sound like deck him. I'm like Jesus Christ
*  The movies like chill oh no, that's I mean that's how Houdini died right
*  But yeah, I get that a lot too when I was doing the rose for sure people come up to me like hey
*  Cunt and I'm like Jesus
*  It's like 230 at the airport panicked when I met famous people and put my foot in my mouth and seemed like a moron
*  Wait did I tell you what I did after I did your show we talked about Survivor
*  And I ran into Jeff Probst it survived my favorite show so every time I'm on your show
*  I will tell the millions of people to keep watching Survivor. It's number one
*  Called sexual assault survivor sexual
*  Bond trauma bonding I was molested
*  But so no, but I ran into him at coffee bean, and he's my guy
*  He's the person I freak out about and I know that's like nerdy, but I love the show so much. It was hilarious
*  That's where I met him. He like I met him at coffee bean. Oh really yeah
*  I dropped name dropped you so fucking fast because I was being such a psycho that I needed him to know that I had
*  Some sort of steak in Hollywood. I was like I'm a comic star right my name's on the wall
*  I just talked about you on Joe Rogan's pockets, and he goes I love Joe
*  He's like come on the show, and I was like I'm a psycho I can't
*  Go and I was like no
*  What if you made a million dollars, and I can't show my feet oh
*  That's right. They'd have to pick
*  No, I just have a bit where I don't show my feet, and I just can't end it for you never seen her Instagram
*  Yeah, all of the
*  Muted me on Instagram even the picture that she took when she was on the show the first time
*  pixelated
*  It's just like a bit now forever
*  For some reason I think it's like my first Google search is Whitney Cummings feet. Yeah, that's every girl. That's ever lived
*  It's not face not face. It's not body. It's not comedy
*  Freaks on line the really like dark in the basement freaks are the ones that are in the feet
*  And what's the deal with someone was saying that was something about like his babies they crawl around and their mom
*  I don't think her moms are barefoot what I know of it
*  Which I don't I'm who knows but it is it's like the they a guy was doing a phantom limb study
*  And he said that when he was checking the brain that the neuro pathways that go
*  From your brain to your feet are next to the ones that go to your genitals
*  So he thinks that that would got mixed and some people oh interesting
*  That was something about see as a kid you see your mom's feet so much when you're so tiny and you
*  You guys really are just like your mom's it's really weird
*  Thing about the book talking about Freud and the the cocaine thing with Freud
*  People back then when Freud was doing coke they didn't think that addiction was for intellectuals
*  They thought brilliant people couldn't get addicted
*  Hilarious like literally he thought he could take coke with abandon and he had fine because that's a mental weakness
*  Yeah, and he would never have a mental weakness
*  You know what I think about a lot though all the people like Bukowski all the people that are like brilliant
*  You like you look at back. They were so fucked up and I always struggle with that where I'm like Picasso
*  I watched the master class of David Lynch, and he was like I go outside
*  He goes he's like I go outside when I write my best writing is done when I do I have a legal notepad
*  I go outside I drink wine and I smoke cigarettes, and I was like so close to smoking cigarettes again
*  I got nicotine toothpicks because I was like maybe I'll be brilliant like
*  But it's like do we need that I don't know
*  I know I do I do think there's a certain like ability to risk and be self-destructive
*  Like I'll smoke cigarettes sometimes
*  I'm like fuck it like fuck it you do need a fuck it mentality to take risks on stage and to stay out till
*  Two in the morning and yeah jeopardize yourself in your relationship. There's value in booze
*  There's value in pot. There's value in mushrooms just value in those things
*  But it's there it's not necessarily the whole thing like I think people can write brilliant shit and be stone-cold sober
*  It's just it's a focus thing like you can talk your mind into psychedelic states
*  I mean, that's what holotropic breathing and my you know that I do breath work all the time
*  I do I've been treating this quarantine like because these are my e-pray love years
*  No, it's my e-pray love years like I should be in India fucking a sherpa. I should not be trapped in my house
*  So I do breath because they're in the Himalayas. Oh my you always do this
*  We get it you read
*  Want to save you from being canceled
*  And he gets her news from info
*  I just read your Instagram, and then I'm like I'm smart I
*  Know Jeff probes and Joe Rogan
*  Jeff probes wanted me on the show, but I'm not ready for it. Yes wait. Let's do it. You want to do together
*  I'm saying to you. I'm doing you I was doing you like Jeff probes want me on the show
*  You should do it don't they have like couples survivor or like friend survivor. We could do it together
*  We're so annoying do you
*  But that's the good thing I get more annoying I do think comedians
*  We do have a like grit like I do think we could win. Oh, yeah
*  If you two fucking psychos
*  Sure, we do have like a certain level of grit and also exoskeleton. It's about
*  Manipulation I mean that's why I shine about like being a pathological liar, but it's also about
*  Guys are both listen anybody who's a comic has got some damage when you're young and then you see vulnerabilities in people
*  You see things to complain about like you would find their weaknesses. You two are both predators. You would see where they're fucked up
*  Well, that's what you had to do in a fucked up home. You had to learn how to beguile and manipulate and charm people
*  And you know I like how our trauma landed us a differently, and you know a beguile means
*  Like a guy bullshit no bullshit seriously you guys should 100% have a show together you guys would like you know
*  There's like guys we fucked and call her daddy. There's always couple girls. Yeah, you guys would
*  dominate that shit the two of you would fucking
*  Dominate that shit the two of you together would have the number one podcast on planet Earth a hundred percent should we try to eclipse Joe Rogan?
*  Yeah, I'm not shitting you a hundred percent could do it you would get all the girls yeah all of them all of them
*  You're both like badass chicks, but you're not you even though you have been victims. You're not very you talk honest your comics
*  Tits are really incredible, but you're both legit comics
*  You two together like that would be a fucking monster combination, and I'll help you
*  Do whatever the fuck you want I think you should do it we also by the way because I just started my podcast you have
*  Your podcast like I now have time for another one right?
*  I've done the podcast enough. I serve him like I know
*  We had some plans because here's the thing that I have to figure out how to get somebody to watch you like hawks
*  Yeah
*  Have to keep the Navy SEAL guys on staff don't bring in the reason
*  I love Annie so much and our relationship so much is that I feel like I don't see people disagree anymore
*  No one will tolerate anyone that disagrees with them in any way right people just want to align with people
*  It's like a fucking echo chamber like circle jerk of like we agree
*  We agree really Annie and I can disagree and fuck with each other
*  And we still respect each other and love each other and have different points of view
*  I
*  Disagree about 80%
*  How it is with most friends you're supposed to be like that like if you're married to your ideas the point where they're your
*  Identity and you you can't be challenged. Well not only that like your ideas an idea is not first of all
*  It's just an idea. It's not even yours. It's just an idea
*  Yeah, and if someone doesn't agree with it, why is it personal?
*  But it is it is for most of us most of the time. It's taken me fuck forever to try to beat that down
*  I haven't I don't have it totally beaten down, but I have it to the point where I recognize. Oh, I'm attached to this
*  Let's just look at it for what it is. It's not me. I'm not this idea
*  But so many people think and this is what we're seeing with politics in the biggest way possible. It's insane
*  This is not to the Democratic Party is you but you have to win
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not just these ideas. It's not just a an election
*  It's you fighting over the masks to the politicize it. They made it like this part of their identity
*  They're like watching everyone asks on their avatar fuck
*  Also, I get annoyed when I because I'll do live streams and stuff from my car not when I'm driving
*  But I'll have my mask on everybody like why you're like I don't the mask means so little to me
*  It means so much to other people. It means so that I don't notice that it's on right? I didn't remember
*  Is really big
*  It's more flattened touches my face yeah, cuz you got beat up I'm sorry, I'm so cool and pretty nobody wants to punch me
*  In the face. I want to do a joke that I couldn't do I was gonna maybe do it on a talk show
*  But about member in the prison inmates were being released. Yeah for COVID
*  Yeah, and I want to do something about that like imagine the warden giving that speech
*  Of like telling the prison inmates that they were about to be released and being like hey guys a couple things changed
*  You now have to wear masks at all times
*  Cover your faces at all times and the police have been defunded go
*  The one guy who got released and then murdered the woman who accused him of rape
*  Yeah
*  I don't even know it's cuz he got a mask. That's what he was going to do if he got out
*  And I don't know if he raped her
*  I don't know what really happened, but he definitely murdered her
*  Allegedly he was claiming that it was a false accusation, and he got out of jail and murdered her
*  Terrifying they're releasing violent criminals
*  It's not just it's not just like people in jail for coke and they get to wear and they get to wear masks all day
*  I mean you look at these ring cameras these security cameras, and I'm like well everyone's in a mask
*  So it's insane, but I do I was thinking like with the looting
*  Like we couldn't have looked like they know enough of it. Don't you recognize people and you see their eyes?
*  I see people I go it's weird how much I can recognize someone just yeah
*  So I was always like it would be so embarrassing to get caught looted like I'm like walking with an Apple watch
*  This is his brother
*  The mayor shut down that tick-tock house
*  That is a weird thing to do look
*  I'm not saying that they shouldn't tell these people they shouldn't have parties and spread it all over the place because they definitely are
*  spreading them like
*  Dr. Malkin when the guys had treated us treated more than a hundred people that went to that party
*  And I think somewhere in the neighborhood of almost half of them had cove it Jesus
*  These people are going to these giant parties and they're sick people at the party and you're drinking and you're 20 and you don't know
*  What the fuck you're doing Sharon yeah, 24 years old
*  like your families
*  My dad 79 I want to see my dad so badly is in Philly, but he doesn't want to see you though
*  No, but honestly like he's so he really is Whitney. It's so sad like he's like nope, and I was like no
*  But what if I camped I was like I'll drive out. I'll camp I'll like
*  I'll get tested before whatever and he was like no he's like because he's just so he just doesn't want it
*  He doesn't want it, and I'm so happy. He's like that, but I'm like, but dad can I hang out our podcast wouldn't be calling your daddy
*  We called our daddy's they didn't pick up daddy's aren't answering
*  Daddy didn't do a good job. I love my dad so much, but it is he's like he's like bring me up today
*  My dad goes bring me up today. Go are you sure you want me to go so well, maybe not
*  I'm so grateful at all the mistakes my parents made
*  Made me like I am equipped to in so many ways that so many of my friends that had right good childhoods aren't and I
*  Can just like sort shit out like adversity was so good for me boring what a comfortable life
*  The most fucked up people I know have married parents. Yeah, all these fucked up expectations
*  Shit was bad when I was a kid there now
*  I was looking like this like now even though everything was fucked up, and I possibly could have been sold into sex
*  You can't really close. Yeah, I was very close
*  You wouldn't go for that. I was tearing the ugly egg.
*  You were hiding under the car like holy shit. That's like one of the good ones. That's a baby one
*  I mean I went to an F-scene high school. My high school literally they all fucked us like all the teachers
*  It just came out another teacher got caught with kiddie porn
*  It was a school with my graduate class was 17 kids like there were seven teachers like come on
*  My drama teacher gave one of the students AIDS
*  Found that out later. Wow you this is bond trauma bond. I know you just saw my bomb. Maybe that's you guys call
*  Dude that's actually fucking
*  Trauma bond
*  So I don't buy but with my parents
*  I always think like they they're good now like why who cares about the past like they're so loving and sweet and awesome that
*  It's like people make mistakes exactly the best they came with the tools they had
*  And I'm happy when she was 21, and she didn't know what the fuck she was doing
*  There's no way you're gonna do a good job as a parent 21, I mean it's just so hard what's your dad's itch
*  I don't know my dad. Yeah, he didn't come out of the woodworks when it was like I
*  Spoken to him since I was seven years old does he know you're you yeah, I have the same name as him
*  Yeah, he's Joe Rogan your junior no I have a middle name
*  Reached out to try to get a cut of all this
*  You got your smarts from your mom I guess
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah my mom's smart
*  My mom's family is very smart very very intense people. Yeah. Yeah, I can tell what's your lineage
*  Mostly Italian a little bit of Irish
*  my yeah, my
*  Biological dad's father was from Ireland everybody's from Europe everybody was all my my parents on both sides all the family was all
*  First-generation immigrants do you like Ireland? I've never been oh you gotta know no, that's not true
*  I've been to Dublin for UFC, and I was in Belfast. I was in Northern Ireland as well for UFC Ireland
*  So three times do you feel like it seems like you feel more of a calling to Italy well?
*  That's the family I knew right you know
*  I'm certainly some sort of a European mutt with Italian and and there's some African
*  I got some African in there and some the small amount of Asia we heard you had a little African
*  Means but I am shocked we haven't gotten canceled
*  But that's it's it's real like mostly
*  Italian and Irish, but if you look at some people like like wasn't Conan O'Brien they found he was like a hundred percent Irish
*  I never seen anything like this. Yeah
*  Really make sense yeah, it's interesting when you find out like where your ancestors came from like this love it
*  I have 1% Asian. I'm like where's that where that come the eyes are very
*  Yeah, G Genghis Khan had that guy fucked so many people he had some preposterous amount of DNA
*  20% of people are descendants of his or something something wacky like like insanity
*  Have you ever seen or read listen listen rather to Dan Carlin's hardcore history yes
*  It's an amazing love and he had a whole series called the wrath of the Khan on Genghis Khan and it fucking blew me away
*  The guy killed 10% of the population of the planet Earth while he was alive
*  Translated to 0.5% of the male population of the world or roughly 16 million descendants living today
*  And how many of those descendants have fucked each other nearly 8% of the men living in the region of the former Mongol emperor
*  Carry the Y chromosomes that are nearly identical to him that means he eight percent of the fucking people
*  Today that live in that region have his genes. That's how many people that guy that is
*  Should have done that on fear factor you have to swallow his come
*  This is really like it's like kimchi they burn
*  Clay jar I wonder because my ancestry is
*  Scotch Irish came through West Virginia coal miners, and there were a lot of Italian coal miners actually yeah
*  Well people did what they had to do maybe guys are cousins. That's the thing about like our world today
*  It's we the jobs that are that suck today
*  You know they still suck like there still are people that coal mine
*  But it's not what most people are doing when they come over
*  The whole scratch and claw that the immigrants had like that my grandparents had those people that came here
*  Like straight off the boat like that is us. That's why New Jersey and New York is so hostile
*  Yeah, the echoes of those
*  Ancestral trauma yeah, and that's always had this bit about California that everybody like got as far as they could and went on fuck
*  I don't live in Hawaii
*  Like they're trying to get away from everything that was on the East Coast there is something so specific about the personality type here
*  There's something just bitch in the DNA
*  Yeah, people want attention. They want attention really really badly, and if they don't get it. They think someone's doing them wrong
*  Culture and I mean I guess it's a lot of people to come out here to pretend for a living yeah very emotional people
*  Well a lot of that and you you're coming out here even if it's not to pretend you're coming out here to get famous
*  Well, I just feel like if you do get famous like a certain type of famous you've now come into this club where they're like
*  Alright, you're not gonna. You're no longer gonna be exactly who you are and especially with actors
*  I feel like your job is to play someone else they go. You're not gonna have any personal opinions
*  You're gonna keep our secrets. We're gonna like you're a pop these kids adrenaline up
*  We're gonna take their blood and we're gonna whatever they do
*  But you know it does feel like you are agreeing to be a part of they go alright
*  We're gonna let you in but you have to not
*  Yeah, you have to keep it yeah, that's really interesting and it's interesting because I'm seeing so many actors now that are like becoming
*  Activists, and I'm like is that just because you played a doctor on TV
*  Getting any attention right the attention stride up. There's no sets you can't go to the set so there's no movies
*  There's no TV show so what do they do they panic and they make these black-and-white videos about how they're gonna take responsibility
*  And they're not gonna allow
*  I care about this I'm gonna act like I it's so prepared. It's so like
*  They do I know I'm seeing all these celebrities pose with Kamala Harris
*  I'm like you know that's gonna do the opposite of what you think it's gonna make America hate her
*  It's gonna make America realize that the con is on you're a part of it
*  Well, I remember with Hillary everyone's like vote for Hillary or you're an idiot
*  Yeah, you know what Joey told me about you that I forgot to ask you last time I was here
*  Did you have piranhas at some point yes, what was that I I'm a problem
*  Do you win better
*  At one point time I had an outdoor courtyard at my house
*  And I was seriously considering glassing it in and getting some crocodile monitors and feeding them rabbits
*  I had this whole plan, and I talked to an architect and I said just move to Florida
*  I was gonna glass in like this terrarium in the middle of my house
*  And I was gonna put tropical plants in there and like have sprinklers
*  So it sprays water and keeps them in a good healthy environment. I was gonna let
*  Wild Kingdom take place in my backyard, but they told me is a real problem with the the rotting of the
*  Carcasses like if you feed rabbits to these things they shit
*  And then you got to clean it up, and you can't really go in there
*  So you'd have to hire someone to come in and like Russell the fucking monitors because they're big if you're seeing a crocodile monitor
*  It's a terrifying looking creature Wow I had this idea because I thought it was like a monitor to watch the crowd
*  Very large scary lizard and it's because I had the piranhas and I would buy
*  But that's not a real good picture of them that's it that's it right there that one the yellow ones in the middle
*  Yeah, and they get fucking big they get big like six feet long, and they can kill you
*  I mean, it's not gonna be a fun
*  One day and there was this guy with like it was a smaller ones like this big and it was yellow
*  I don't know what is maybe one of the little dragon that lady that's holding that one on the top
*  I was playing with it like that and then I someone was like I saw later at the comedy store was like you know
*  That those could bite your face off they do bite your nose off
*  But you can't predict what a large lizard is gonna decide
*  Fucking cool though that looks like a t-rex eye look at that dinosaur. It's a goddamn Raptor. He's gripping you like Mike Binder did
*  I don't know when I became like the person that you touch when you want to say something offensive
*  Move seats was that you fucked up and move seats, and then you were the closest one
*  I don't know well. I thought Rogan should be in the middle you guys should have a tick-tock house together
*  We just do it without electricity we're like fuck this we're gonna live it out
*  I'm like you guys like Whitney you like you could do that you could have a tick-tock dude
*  I would fucking do that I have her kind of in your money. You can have her rent
*  I've kind of been doing that in the quarantine. I've sort of been like like Tim Dylan's been staying with me
*  Esther I make Annie come over. I just like I want to start like a coven of comics
*  Yeah, well, I mean like we're saying like that's what we miss the most
*  We wanted to be a harem. I felt it. I felt trying to finger you
*  I can't speak for Esther, but I can just don't pee on me
*  I I do I started a podcast in my house. I have a podcast studio
*  We could do it out of my podcast studio my
*  I have a podcast studio too. It's a kitchen. It is my goal to make Annie rich as fuck and just watch you go completely insane
*  I love it. Like you are gonna be. I think she'll handle it. You think she'll be okay being rich. Yep. Yeah, I think so too
*  I feel like you're gonna give it all to like your ex-boyfriends anyway. You're gonna stay poor. I've actually stopped doing that
*  I actually stopped paying for my I've gone broke Rogan you were this was when you used to give me $100 bills
*  We're in the parking lot and I go I'm standing next to Rogan, right?
*  And I'm like we're friends we do the same thing obviously has been doing it longer than everything
*  Thing that we're parked in the same parking lot
*  Can you teach me how to be rich because I live in that car and you that's like one of your 60 cars or something
*  And you started laughing in my face
*  You pulled out a lot of money. This means nothing to me handed me $300 bills
*  I tried to give you money once but I thought it would weird out our relationship
*  Well, you want you want your money every time I saw her he would like slap me high five
*  But then it got weird cuz I thought you thought I was showing up to get money
*  No
*  But then did you remember when you said well, I was worried you were gonna think that oh, no, I never thought that was fun
*  It was a fun little gag. You you this is the funniest bit ever
*  We should do it more like a million
*  It gets funnier than more money it is but you
*  You told me to you were like if I handle the people that are because I love watching you get
*  Attacked by fans like it's one of my feet when they approach because I see them getting nervous
*  You can see them too probably from fighting
*  I have like you're so uncomfortable and I see them coming and I watch you you're being cool
*  You're being cool and you're very nice. You're fan-friendly, but they're just having such a moment. They can't like get over themselves
*  They're like freaking out. So I always like what I told you then you I'll pay you a hundred dollars to get people away
*  But then I started body checking people like that's my friend
*  When someone comes up to Rogan like you see them circling like a fucking barracuda you're talking to Rogan you see just people
*  Circling for some reason they always want to show you a video. No, they have more of they aren't they're unfolding a paper
*  They're they always have something queued up for you to watch
*  Yeah, I got to show you something and but you handle it really well you do it without hurting their feelings. Yeah
*  You're so nice. I try you do this Jedi mind trick where you're like, no, thanks, man
*  Like you make that try to be very nice
*  But it's an odd thing like and but like I said, it was it's odd when I meet like when I met Bourdain
*  One of the first thing I said is my wife says you're my boyfriend. That's like the first thing. I thought it's so funny
*  She's like you're gonna meet your boyfriend
*  She thinks it's just being funny and I said it to him and he's like, whoa. I'm like
*  You're not a comic you're a guy with a thumb ring so sexy dude, dude, I'm great great guy
*  He's so fun to hang around with I really enjoyed that. Did you read that article?
*  I sent you that girl Leah McSweeney wrote I started and I was like, oh
*  Was it upsetting yeah, yeah
*  She was just talking about like the toxic foot was it before he had died or was it after he died?
*  That she wrote she was right. She was writing about toxic femininity during the me too movement
*  Which was like a breath of fresh air. Thank you. And but she was talking about
*  Sierra agenda and
*  Rose McGowan and the stuff with the Anthony Bourdain and like how fucked up it was but she just she's really she's cool
*  She's on the New York Housewives. Yeah
*  It's very sort of about him and yeah, but it was it's a raw sentencing. It's a really good article
*  Okay, there's toxic people. Yes
*  Yeah
*  That's what the problem is if you get into this whole believe all women thing or believe all men thing or believe all trans people
*  Yeah anybody you're gonna run into people that are juke in the system
*  Yeah, I'm running to toxic people and the people that say believe all this person at the same people
*  It's also the same people go you can't generalize about all people. It's like, what is it?
*  Well, that's they're trying to rope you into complicity you have to comply and if they're saying believe all anything you must comply
*  Yeah, that's what they're doing. They're playing a game with you and it's not a rational one
*  It's not of I've thought this through and this is the best way as a sensitive nuanced person
*  We should approach this we should look at it with an open mind. Yeah, not saying that think believe all anything
*  Disrespectful to like real victims. It's like yeah, I always hated the hatch like I was with joke
*  I go the me to movement the hatch tag bother me because it's like here's like I had a girl who I got in a
*  fight with who her argument was
*  She goes you don't understand what the me to movement was
*  I'm the only one in this group of girlfriends that has actually had actual assault happen
*  You know and sat in court and stuff and like really
*  They're willing to break the law to touch you we did do the right thing, you know
*  And it's like so it was like I do think I am and I have a good
*  perspective on this stuff and I and my and she goes that's not what we're fighting for the me to movement is about
*  Why when I go to the comedy club to the male comics kiss me on the cheek and not the other guys and I'm like
*  What so that's this this is what I said
*  This is this part of the hatch tag and then it's like real rapes or no wait
*  This is real rapes and then this is like that part, right?
*  And then they're like trying to go like the give me some of that sweet real rape
*  I want some of that real rape give me some of that attention
*  Christ trying to get the like you can't group it all together
*  Not you know that a comic not kissing his friends on the cheek
*  But kissing use your words and tell the person you don't want them to kiss you on the cheek
*  It's not the same as getting like
*  We all know some people we can hug each other. Yeah, we hug each other with some people. I don't hug
*  I don't know him that way. I don't know them. But if I hug you it's cuz I love you. Yeah, that's why I'm hugging you
*  But it's all it's everything's context
*  It's like it's like I've never felt weird around Joe Rogan hugs cool
*  Then someone holds on too long like like yikes or they squeeze your back or something. Yeah, put on your lower back or touch your neck
*  Oh my god. There's this one girl at the comedy star
*  I don't want to say any distinguishing features because I don't you do I don't want to I don't like being
*  You can't right now. You can't like just say a little shitty thing someone did because they'll like be canceled
*  But here's what I'll say. It's like calling the cops on a block. You can't do it anymore
*  They're gonna get they're gonna get killed
*  Like I can't be like oh it was so funny when that one comic grabbed my ass, you know, like you can't say
*  But I mean it's interesting because it's like when I do I always add context and go like you don't get to decide what my
*  Experience with that person was if someone's back my ass and I thought it was funny
*  I get to decide that I don't get to decide how it affected right
*  You know this like self-righteous indignation and this like forcing me to have the experience you want me to have just so we can get
*  In some adrenaline junkie like Twitter fight like you don't get to decide how it affected me, you know
*  So it's like women use your voices and speak up
*  But if you say something I don't like so you get you get blow back cuz you're like slowing the progress of outrage
*  You like hit the brakes on outrage because you're like, I'm not outraged. I'm not like what you should be outraged
*  We could use you you could be a part of the outrage puddle
*  I'm outraged about a lot of things, you know
*  But I'm not gonna lie and pretend I'm outraged about things that I'm not outraged about
*  That's the thing you're allowed to have your own interpretation of any experience
*  If you have a bunch of friends and all of you run up and smack each other in the ass when you see each other
*  Right. That's the thing you guys have decided is okay
*  And if you stop liking it, yeah go I don't like that anymore
*  Right and if someone does it and then you say they don't like it
*  They should apologize and they should never do it again. And you say I'm sorry. I thought we were doing that
*  I'm so sad that like apologies don't work anymore
*  I'm actually doing I'm doing like a limited series podcast with Bonnie McFarlane about it called cancel us next Tuesday, son
*  Please be honest
*  But we're canceling different things each time like I want you to do the cancel romance because everything's like molesting in romance now
*  I was dating a guy who was 30 and he asked every he said can I take off your bra?
*  Can I kiss you?
*  Too old to even understand like a teacher when they're when you're like, can I go to the bathroom like you mean may I
*  I
*  Know it's really weird
*  I think like the new sex sound instead of like slurping and suctioning is gonna be it's gonna be two body cameras
*  Just like clinking against each other
*  We all need to record on both sides. What the fuck's going on?
*  In the room, that's all you have to
*  Punch my cervix with my own hand there will be cameras everywhere. I remember I was there sternum
*  I was in a I was in Houston like a year and a half ago when I was running like a new hour
*  That a lot of it was about the me too stuff
*  You know trying to keep it in context like a lot of stuff shouldn't be reduced to a tweet or a fucking
*  Op-ed or whatever. So I was trying to really like
*  Dimensionalize it and I'm in Houston. I go on stage and I'm I'm sort of like taking arguing both sides
*  Which is what comics?
*  Where we play devil's advocate and I said something about like a guy that had smacked my ass and work or something and I was
*  Like yeah, that shouldn't have happened
*  That was sort of my take on it and this woman in the front row just went girl take the compliment and move on
*  Like people have different takes on this
*  Like okay, so I was I've been walking trying to walk five miles a day just thinking and going through shit and coming up with
*  Ideas and I was walking with like my fanny pack. I'm sweating. I look like shit
*  You guys see like the crazy sunglasses
*  I wear like the least hot thing in the world and I get this beep from this like beat up Corolla
*  You know from like the 80s and this guy like rolls up and just start
*  Wacking
*  Barely like it's like barely hard like stop bragging on this podcast what I'm saying I
*  Even when I'm ugly
*  I had so many a range of emotions because then he had like a baby seat in the back and I was like what's going on here?
*  But then like so I was just thinking I was like I went through this range of emotions and then I was like, you know
*  One day I will miss this I do think for real. I'll be like
*  I've got a lot of guys do that to old ladies
*  No, but also hot forever
*  Something like that like grab me in a way that
*  Ostensibly seems really weird and it hasn't made me feel uncomfortable
*  There's time someone will come to the commons or say absolutely nothing look at me a certain way and I'm like something's off about that
*  You're banned, you know, you're off the wall
*  You're allowed to have that and guys are allowed to have that too
*  Like there's some women that you're being around you're gonna get the fuck away
*  Yeah, or they'll grab you or how about Bill Burr's bit that he had in his last special paper tiger about a comic
*  Who's a very prominent feminist comic who slapped him in the dick?
*  He was going on to the stage
*  They were swapping positions and he was going on the stage and she was coming off and she slaps his dick and they're all these
*  There are so many I'm trying to like really for my next special work on like the way that we're sexist towards men because it's just
*  No one talks about that. I have that your Andrew Huberman on my podcast the other day is
*  Amazing brilliant neuroscientist who's like working on this thing for your eyes and all the stuff and he comes on it's like he's on my podcast
*  And I'm like, you're so hot. You're hot
*  If this was reversed if a podcast host had a female scientist on and was like you're hot
*  I'm sure I like I honestly like I'm like I think under these guidelines I have
*  Okay, but here's the difference the difference
*  I
*  Huberman's a gorilla. He's a big dude. Yeah, big. Yeah 230 pound man
*  Like he can't say that to you that way if he was the comedian and you were the scientist
*  It would be threatening to you. You're not threatening him by saying he's hot. It's just a comp. So right
*  You don't know what she can manipulate
*  But it was you know, cuz I was cuz he looks like a
*  Neurologist in a Marvel movie, right?
*  Marvel movies like he's gonna tear his like scientist thing off
*  Neck is big brawny dude. He's a guy you would see in a Marvel movie who would play scientists
*  You'd be like that's not a fucking sign. I'm getting a lot guys stop
*  But there are times I feel like I get away with shit that a guy would never fucking get right
*  But it is fair that's the dynamic because there's no threat from you
*  That's why you can get away with it
*  Like if you said something crazy me about Whitney what the fuck are you talking about?
*  It would never be like oh Jesus now have to be scared to be alone with her
*  Woman has to be scared to be alone
*  But I think what happens to is there's like the power thing comes into it too
*  And then you're like, so is it like social power political power?
*  Career power or is it no we know girls who have forced guys into having sex with them girls who are in power
*  Who forced guys who were working for them to have sex? We do we do know we know that we know them
*  So this but we don't give a fuck
*  Mean it's benton and he's very upset with me. We don't care. Yeah, we don't care
*  But if it was the other way around it would be a real hard to care if they do care
*  I care like if they feel victimized by it. I do care
*  Yeah, I'm for the victim or sure thing like if they do feel like fuck
*  I thought I wasn't gonna but here's the thing if a guy's like Jesus. I can't believe I'm doing this
*  This is so disgusting, but I need this job and he does it we laugh. I would be like
*  You did what no you didn't
*  And I think a lot of people get caught into the in the sort of logistics of like well
*  Would you be able to get a boner if you didn't want to do it right? Do you mean? Oh?
*  Yeah, we're not believing men. We're doing right. That's a good point. You know it is a legitimate good point
*  It is a good point. Okay, like can you as a man get raped?
*  Without getting a bone you know what I mean if you can if it's just mental to drink the cum of whatever animal that was
*  Then it's just mental to not be able to yeah
*  Certainly make an argument that if a man gets an erection that he's enjoying
*  But here's the thing can a woman force you into doing something and then you start enjoying it
*  So you go along with it, but the beginning part was force yeah, right, so is it still okay? It's a good question
*  That's that's that's that would be like a overly aggressive man to if a woman saying no no no
*  Starts like yeah is that rape yeah kind of is especially if you've got a good editor
*  It's so hard because like four years ago. We know from comics like what the hot topics were and it was fucking
*  50 shades of gray where we were going we were going when we say no we mean yes
*  That was literally like if you have a helicopter in your billionaire
*  No, it's another great bit that burr has where he goes no always means no he's like no it doesn't sometimes like no
*  No, it doesn't sometimes like no
*  No, it doesn't sometimes like no
*  Stop no stop. It's really hard. That's that's true, but on paper. It's not you look at it in quotes. It's like okay
*  Yeah, that's not cool. Do you know about the consent condoms? I was working on a bit about this before these condoms no
*  I'm allergic to not having fun
*  I'm allergic to not having fun
*  I'm allergic to not having fun
*  I
*  Didn't realize until I was like 28. I thought it was a fact that guys could be allergic to latex
*  No my balls drop it's not
*  Because guys would use that as an excuse to not use a condom in the wrong dating pool guys are all allergic to shit
*  but so okay wait, so
*  It's a condoms are you you have to have four hands on it to open the condom
*  Which by the way if you're raping there's probably not condom involved and
*  But I but the joke I was trying to work on is like you have to put all your hands on it like a Ouija board
*  Do you love me
*  Put it into the trash cuz nobody's using condoms come on. Let's make condoms harder to you
*  Barrier between condoms I don't think I've ever gotten involved in that I'm always just like you handle that
*  I don't know what people got mad
*  There was outrage when the condoms came out because they went that's ableist because if people don't have hands
*  They can't put their hands on and my point was if you don't have hands aren't you just fist fucking anyway
*  Are you like risk fucking them you're like stub fucking we're playing a game of Jeopardy with outrage
*  You know just looking for things to be pissed about if you're really so pissed that you need four hands to open up this
*  Condom because you only have one hand or someone out there only has one hand
*  That's a crazy thing to get upset about also get a friend. They'll lend you a hand
*  But it's also I think it's on it's on us to stop taking the outrage seriously. We have to just ignore it
*  We have to ignore it's not that big of a deal
*  Game it's a find a thing that you could be upset about find it
*  I don't have to actually be upset I got in trouble, and I and I'm exaggerating it wasn't that bad
*  But I said basket case basket case
*  Yeah
*  Basket case because basket case refers to soldiers in World War one that had all of their limbs removed
*  They could fit in a basket
*  They'd call them a basket case, and I was like I said something where I was like if you insult yourself
*  It's a self-deprecating thing. I'm saying I'm crazy. I'm basket case and they're like you're offending World War one soldiers
*  No, I'm offending myself
*  Trouble for it was she was saying something it was veterans day or something and it was about
*  She's made some like it was like spaghetti Oh's or something
*  She's like yeah
*  The only thing they can eat or something that they can eat without have teeth or something and it was like people like how dare you?
*  And it's like but they are elderly and it's not
*  She's just making a joke and then she didn't she put out an apology that wasn't an apology and was very good
*  Yeah, I mean we need to really good
*  I think this is what happens when sports goes away. This is what happens when everything's gone away
*  Yeah, this is like the vibration of the country is already a vibration
*  It was already happening, but this accentuated it in a big way the vibration so off all the unemployed
*  Did you read you know James Altucher the guy who he's one of the owners of stand-up, New York?
*  Did you read the article that he wrote about New York? He's like New York City is dead forever
*  It's not coming back, and it's fucking terrifying
*  Yeah, and it's true
*  And it's it's accurate and I think that's the same with LA and I think it's the same with a lot of people and people
*  Are on fucking tilt right now. Do you think everything like Austin so cool?
*  Austin's dope, but do you think that the sort of modern-day?
*  Coliseum is Twitter like we've always had this in us. We've always wanted to watch people get torn apart
*  No, I think it's a totally new thing. Yeah, it's not just watching people get torn apart. It's the ability to participate
*  It's also it's like having stock and taking someone down
*  It's a you're you're getting addicted to this weird feedback loop that the book Irresistible talks about you're putting something
*  Out there, and then you're reading the response you you're addicted to how many likes and retweets and shit you get and I think you
*  Feel addicted to feeling part of something. I helped take that
*  I'm an activist yeah
*  People have it in their like bios now like activists
*  Why is you as an activist they complain a lot they complain a lot and they try to get people cancelled
*  Just like you're an obnoxious complain
*  Like you like the environment like oh fuck of course like the environment, but I gotta go to Whole Foods
*  Actors don't get any attention anymore they become activists
*  And this is a really common thing with the people that are just pure narcissists
*  I just see them like supporting these fucking
*  Qualifications like what?
*  I just feel like if you want to get the ultimate virtue signaling and the best way to be like a good person
*  Because I do believe all of this is like a fear of death and people want to like live on
*  Terrible as their life yeah
*  So they're like if I do all this good stuff like when I die like all the news will talk about me
*  And they'll celebrate my birthday or whatever and I'll live on forever, but with if you think about with oh
*  My god, I'm having an ADD moment. What was I talking about ADD ADD you were talking about?
*  Cancel culture cancel culture activism activism the best way to do it is the way that George Michael did it where he was
*  underground
*  Amazing he was like giving to these charities. He was like a silent philanthropist
*  So then if you really want that attention, which I'm not saying that's what he did when he died
*  It came out that he was like yeah amazing yeah
*  And it wasn't like the glory of being on this earth like everyone being like wow you're like
*  That's so amazing that you don't even as much and people post their donations. It's so great for the right reasons
*  I'm not rich enough to understand
*  Understand like when you see a celebrity give a huge tax or donation everyone's like they're so amazing
*  It's like well. That's also right off for them. Oh my god. They have to give a certain amount of care
*  To learn about it's just so
*  Transparent and gross when you see people trying so hard to get people to think they're virtuous, and that's what it is
*  It's like us today, but when when you see people do it that you know are pure narcissists. It's offensive
*  But I felt like during Black Lives Matter
*  I was so conflicted because I did want to I was like I don't want people to I am like for I want
*  People to have equality and and I do believe their systematic racism and and our systemic. I said
*  I'm
*  More but you did fucking send me to shitty schools, but um no, but I do believe in that
*  But like with the black square I ended up posting it
*  And then I the reason I was so mad at myself is because I always I'll do the thing
*  But I always want there to be an element of jokes because I'm a comedian
*  Yeah, so I realized after I posted it what I should have done was repost Rachel dollas
*  I was black square, and then it would have had like in the corner
*  What is that and I fucking missed that opportunity?
*  But people were like your virtues and it's like I just
*  I don't I do want to let it be known that I'm willing to like lose followers over
*  But you have to also know what like their motive and doing it. It's so clear when someone's doing it itself
*  I think it's like when someone dies and you see them post a picture of them and the person that died
*  It's like did you just go into your iCloud and be like where's that photo of me and the dead famous person?
*  rivers died
*  someone posted a comic post who's terrible posted a thing that was like
*  I'm I'm gonna miss Joan Rivers once she saw me perform and told me how amazing I
*  Make this death about you
*  There's nothing grosser than when someone talks about how much someone who died loved that
*  Loved them thought they were awesome, right?
*  Notre-Dame was burning and everyone was posting photos of them at Notre Dame
*  Bragging about you know just bragging about your chin none of them went in none of them waited in line to go in they were
*  Outside like fuck that line
*  And then as soon as it caught on fire, I was like this was me well during the protest
*  They were getting people were canceling like the the people taking selfies with the they were taking selfies and then going home
*  Yeah, actually protesting I saw that I wasn't one of the protests and people come and take a picture and just dart out
*  I was like Jesus Christ. I was so I told down now
*  I was like if you need my my white body to jump in front of you because they were showing like videos of like white
*  Girls like going in front of black guys when the cops would come over to stand in front of them as a look a white shield
*  I was like I was like done out. I'll stand in front
*  I'll use my white body in front of you
*  But only when the cameras on like I just like jump in front like get my photo up and then I'm like alright
*  So ridiculous, but yes
*  I think it's just like a matter of motives and it is so clear when someone's using it right and their own agenda
*  It's just that was the dance addicted to attention. I love attention
*  Media is the big attention fix and everybody's hooked on imagine thinking that someone
*  Imagine like being on a soap opera and thinking someone wants your take
*  Yeah on politics like imagine being an actress. They think it's a career move. I really do
*  I think when you want to support the right candidate or you want to support the right bill
*  You want to add zero celebrities Scott Baio. So yeah zero. Well look at he had zero
*  Zero celebrities. Yeah Kanye eventually, but yeah, I know
*  Is it coming on?
*  think so the irony that
*  Celebrities think they're helping when in reality they're harming the fact that they didn't go like oh
*  This is why people hated Hillary a big part of it how that's why Ricky Gervais is so funny like calling everyone out at the
*  ceremonies because they were like they're all like fuck Harvey Weinstein times up. I'm like your friend from last year
*  How many of them have videos of them thanking him with the Academy Awards? That's what and then they're all like crazy
*  There's so many people thanking Harvey Weinstein how pissed to say so many like you fucking ass
*  But he probably was like I never saw this coming
*  I've ever thought that I could have get taken down with all those videos of all those people
*  Meryl Streep saying how amazing I am all these people say amazing. Yes
*  Yeah, so got taken down how crazy that was I remember being at the Comedy Store
*  When Ricky Gervais was doing that and I posted oh everyone's mad at Ricky Gervais
*  Which probably means he told some jokes like I tweeted that or something Ben Shapiro was tweeting it like Candice Owens was all
*  All of a sudden I was all right because I was defending jokes. He knows about this
*  All right, if you're a pro comedy because they're not being real this they're not being honest
*  They just write this one a box you into a corner and label you and then play this game to see how many people retweet
*  It and where it goes and whether they can get you canceled. No one wants new one with that. No one that
*  Yeah
*  That's a lot of it what it is it's like they just look at you as a target
*  I read on summer that 22% of people are on Twitter and of that
*  2% generate 80% of the comments. Yeah, so it's also such a small group
*  There's a lot of them are mentally ill like legitimately mentally ill like depressed anxious fucked up checking the shit constantly
*  On their on their bios. It'll say proud mental
*  I always get someone that is like you're a busted whore and I always want to like go to their page and so I was like
*  Girl who's so obviously a woman writes that heard she identifies as her she and you're like
*  If it's a different thing show me like you ever does they them you write they them on your bio. I'm
*  Love it. You're a they it's a I mean, I think that we have to stop taking cancel call
*  Like we have to stop giving it air to me. We have to stop it. We can tell
*  It is what's important
*  Like this but I mean I just like when everyone's like we can't do jokes, yes you can fucking do them
*  Just keep doing them. Marina Franklin has a joke that I don't I'm gonna butcher it, but it's something along
*  Do you know her? She's a black. Yeah, she's so funny. Okay, so she goes she goes
*  I I can't use people's correct pronouns cuz then I just sound like a slave if I'm like they that you know, I mean
*  When you get into a comedy club telling jokes people want to laugh other comics might not want to journalists might not want to
*  Justice wars might not want to but the average person is like not on Twitter everyday attack right medians
*  Yeah, well people trying to be offended. Let's talk about earlier. That's not that they're actually offended
*  They're trying to be offended and then becomes a game find things that are targets
*  Yeah, is it actually offending you is that way you're talking about or have you found a valid target?
*  And now you're just going after it because this is the game you like yeah, you sank my battleship
*  They're playing a little weird game makes them feel important or something
*  and then the the most annoying fucking thing I get is whenever I like laugh at an offensive joke and someone goes
*  You're enabling like oh, so I'm the problem
*  I also got a realize like even invalid criticism is still valid like to that dummy
*  That's like a valid piece of criticism like we can't silence them either
*  With the whole thing is mocking them, right?
*  Like mock it so it like you expose it for what you really think it is
*  But they have to be able to do that too so we can figure out where the line really is
*  This is what a lot of people that are really super liberal don't understand
*  Why they think it's a good idea to silence and deplatform conservative people
*  It's a terrible idea because then you don't develop the proper arguments for what they're doing
*  Yeah, the way these things are supposed to go is someone says something like you're an enabler and you like shot the fuck
*  And then someone has a valid piece of crisis and then the comic kind of looks like a dick and then maybe the
*  And then and then you figure out yeah what we actually agree on instead of using buzzwords and using like little things that people say
*  To just find a target we both have to exist
*  Yeah for us both to exist and we figure it out and a lot of those people are gonna get out of that
*  They're gonna be your friend one day. Also you're you're allowed like
*  Like you're not better than other people because you think a certain way
*  There's so many people that are like I'm right obviously and you're wrong obviously and it's like that's not how things work
*  And with all the canceling all the Twitter stuff they're going pat like down this line of which now we've given them with Twitter
*  You're just giving people a transcript of like all the shit
*  You've said over the years, but it's like you're expected to have this perfect record like you're never supposed. We're
*  That's how we learn that's how we grow it's through adversity we learn we fuck up we fail we get back up and there's no room
*  For that anymore, but it's also here's the thing like why are you spending so much time complaining about other people all day?
*  I'll tell you why because you're not healthy
*  That's right
*  You're not doing smart things if I look at your Twitter timeline, and I'm seeing tweets 12 hours a day
*  You're a crazy person. You might not realize you're a crazy person
*  But there'll be a day where we will look back and go remember when anyone could get on Twitter at any time you think there's gonna
*  Be like like smoking. There's no restrictions. I think Twitter is gonna be like blockbuster video
*  I think we're gonna look back you remember when we used to communicate through Twitter. Oh my god. It was so toxic
*  Everybody was so mean we're gonna hit some new thing next that's gonna allow people to read each other's minds or Elon Musk
*  Neuralink which he's talking about communicating with no words. We're gonna hit that and it's gonna make this seem like nonsense
*  Yeah, what we're lacking in this is one of things that in that book irresistible
*  There's there's no empathy in these conversations, and that's the big part of the problem
*  It's like you don't see the people you don't feel their pain so you could say horrible shit to them
*  It's the vast majority of the way people are communicating like a lot of
*  Majority their communication is text messages and tweets and none of it is person to person like well
*  These kids are arguing with each other through text because they don't want to look at each other and talk like human
*  But ironically only way you develop and grow as a person
*  Louie did like a whole kind of bit on one of the late shows before obviously the cancelling but
*  He where he was talking about that
*  He's like you need like his you need to see someone's feelings be hurt to realize that your words have a specific type of
*  Impact on people and then you decide like oh, I don't want to do that anymore
*  I don't wanna but if you don't if you just are shooting these things out
*  And they're going into this void and then you get a you get praised from them by other twats who are sitting at home by themselves
*  Yeah, canceler
*  Like a little mom little mobs, it's a drug
*  I mean it is a drug you do feel high and I gotta say it's like the same way when you drive by a car
*  Accident you're like well. I hope I see you so everybody
*  Like when I see that someone you know you they do these like so-and-so is over party
*  Which is so fucked up when you think about it, but I'm also like pure adrenaline, and I can't help myself
*  Oh my god a bunch of female comedians who are like the some that would probably say the Comedy Store sucks
*  they did a
*  Retirement party for men or was like all these like comics that aren't past it
*  Actual gloves female comics yeah, and they had like a banner
*  And it was like by men or whatever was like two years ago. I'm like that's adorable that sounds like a good
*  All we wanted you to be fun like
*  Super funny, and he and I were you know bonding a lot over the break about sort of like you know
*  No one's been meaner to us in this business than women
*  Yeah, it's like like no one's have that uncomfortable conversation. Yeah, you know this is chill. Yeah
*  It's not men versus women. It's bad versus good good men and good men versus bad women and bad men again
*  It's like we live in generalization
*  So we love generalizations, and we don't like nuance because it makes us force it forces us to look at our own ideas
*  Yeah, it's uncomfortable. No it's just because you know men are
*  Doing well in in a business, and you're not it doesn't mean the men have some sort of a conspiracy
*  You know I think it's harder for a woman to be a comic I do and I think it's harder because of society
*  I think it's more difficult to talk about things that are important like a man can talk about politics is
*  Very difficult for a woman to go on stage and talk about politics men can talk about sex
*  And they don't look like they're a slut or damage
*  I think you're I think if you're on a man has to you can if you're an unattractive
*  I was gonna get that a woman like there was who Christopher Hitchens
*  Christopher Hitchens had a bit in Vanity Fair wrote a story women aren't funny
*  And it was like this this really sort of takedown of like the kind of comedy that a woman has to do to be funny
*  They have to be butchie or has to be male kind of com
*  I don't necessarily agree with them because I think there's a lot of women that are really funny
*  But I think it's a harder path. I think it's a more narrow keyhole. You're shooting through whereas a guy
*  I think in general audiences will accept a man telling them what's wrong
*  Whereas I think a lot of men in particular on dates do not want to hear a woman especially an attractive one
*  Tell the the guy in the audience that he's wrong
*  I think women are naturally more empathetic can tend to be more empathetic just because we're mothers were nurturers were caregivers and so
*  We're barren and we have to do comedy whenever like like Joey says something's like you're smart
*  You're like you you know you're like one of the guys like you fit in with it
*  I'm like you fit in with me bitch like this is how I am
*  But but but it's like you fuck I keep forgetting. I've got to stop smoking weed
*  It's like early on
*  Females are more empathetic right we're empathetic
*  So we're more willing to listen to a guy talk about his day jerking off or anything like one of those things that maybe
*  We wouldn't have the experience of having as a woman
*  But guys are less interested in hearing about our wasn't one of the points that Hitchens was making that were wired to
*  Worry about women if they hurt themselves and so much of comedy is talking about I hurt myself
*  I made this mistake. I you know that it's sort of like we're wired to
*  Be protective of them, so it's not funny like if if a man slips on a banana peel
*  It's funny if a woman slips on a banana peel. Are you okay? Yeah? There's any one factor
*  I think there's a bunch of factors, but I think that's it too
*  Yeah, I think that's that factors in too
*  But I think the big one is men don't want to hear women talking about things like opinions on politics
*  Yeah, our opinions on money or opinions are like they get mad a lot of guys like yeah
*  They'll get that thing especially young guys young guys on dates
*  Cool guy and some girls saying something like here's the fucking problem with men yeah
*  This bitch
*  You don't vote for Biden. You know you ain't whatever whatever they want to say
*  But it had to be in his head he had to be like damn, that's a good clip right there
*  Do you remember a time when we were doing stand-up and people would intro I says so are you guys ready for a lady?
*  Their way of saying if you guys need to go to the bathroom or fill your meter now
*  It's the time that was we talked about the other night the word comedian that used to be a word
*  I get that a lot people say that like it's ironic because it's like the New York Times and like really fancy
*  Journalists say comedian
*  Woke of the woke right that's supposed to be sophisticated
*  A lot of people don't like actress anymore. They just say I'm an actor
*  Yeah, cuz a female could be an actress don't care like they prefer activists
*  Yeah, I actually don't mind being like treated like an under because that's an opportunity to make a joke
*  Yeah, I always bring you on I sang before like sometimes go
*  Jason Gulleran is the comic he'll bring me on and like this sexy this next sexy, and I'm always like
*  But instead of getting offended I just go on stage and I always go when we were out in the parking lot one night
*  He said if my wife were dead, I'd fuck I'd fuck the shit out of me
*  I was like if I was dead possibly could fuck the shit out of me and it always gets a laugh
*  It makes the less uncomfortable. It's like our job. It's fun is to like make fun
*  Yeah, like of a weird situation like not go like I'm deeply like why would it be offended who cares?
*  Yeah, and it's fun to come on in a hole sometimes and dig out
*  It's just definitely some way to break the ice. Mm-hmm
*  And there's also like it you know I remember when I first started and I was like you know I look back
*  And I'm like people look like women aren't funny and women are I was like I wasn't funny when I started
*  No one's funny when they fuck I was so funny when I started
*  But I remember being so fed and when people like women aren't funny
*  And you know I couldn't get stage time because I didn't deserve so I'm there's a lot of guys that are not funny, too
*  Yeah, of course not isolated to any gender and a lot of women that are funny
*  That's why the whole thing is so offensive because it's to the people that have already
*  Gotten through and become professional comics, and they know what the real deal is the real deal is you like everybody was funny
*  Yeah, that's the real deal real deal is everybody is kind of really cool to each other that are really funny
*  Yeah, and you make fun. It's Michelle or whoever is a killer fortune Femster
*  They're only curly-haired women sorry that's I think
*  I think a funny
*  No one I mean all those people are just accepted
*  That's right because they're funny
*  Yeah
*  Nobody pays money drives out to a comedy show gets a date pays the two drink minimum and then wants to like
*  Intentionally not laugh at someone yeah nobody does that they want you to win
*  But I think a lot of guys have a hard time with women being in control. I really do yeah
*  I know a lot of guys. That's what they don't like that. She's hilarious. I don't fucking talks about this too much
*  Yeah, there's just no I feel like there's no off limits. It's just funny's funny. You can talk about anything. There's no
*  There's no fit remember these to be male
*  Political comedians like will durst like his whole act would be political or Randy Kretico the whole act was political Jimmy tingles very political
*  There's never a woman comic like that. No. There's like talk shows like Samantha B or like
*  Right now shows like talk talk
*  But even Samantha B like in an audience when Samantha B had I remember they were first running the ad campaign for the show coming out
*  They still were doing things that where it was like they had her have like these big balls
*  There's like they were like playing so much on the gender thing where it's almost like
*  Just do the show and don't which by the way do whatever you want obviously she has a successful show
*  But it's like let's just be women doing a thing and not have to talk about the fact that we're
*  Well when you're a woman, and you're in a position of power like that you kind of have to like
*  The won't be the one who takes control and like with there's an issue that needs to be discussed you kind of have to
*  Call it out on your show right it's like it's not like a fuck guy is
*  Doing a show like a Jimmy Tingle or a nunchen me tingle Jimmy. You gotta stop saying tingle
*  Guys from Boston when I first started who's a brilliant brilliant comedian
*  But anyway a male comic doesn't feel like they have to defend men right like if
*  Another male comic is getting shit on they don't feel like they have to jump into the fray hey us guys have to stick
*  Together but women do I don't think I don't
*  I don't have the parts. I don't have tits and I don't know how to say Baron with Baron Trump around
*  Becomes a word that like hey
*  Like that's the least of his problems say infertile you have other words right use the right use those very long ones
*  Our proposition for oh
*  Well I was telling her you two are the ones that have made me freak out the most about whether I can have kids or not
*  So do you want to go have Z's on freezing her eggs you want to freeze your eggs?
*  Well you both were like you both were like if you're gonna have kids you put her from so she was like freeze your eggs
*  Today I was like can I borrow money for the uber at least like there's no more uber in LA as of today. Oh really?
*  Cool yeah because of kovat there's nothing to do no
*  Right
*  Because the regulations the state government wants to put on people they want them all to be employees
*  Mmm, yeah, but they're using the kovat as though. No, they're not using kovat
*  I thought it's just they just passed it and uber and Lyft are both pulling out of California
*  Which is gonna mean how many people are gonna have to drive drunk now Wow?
*  Exactly how many people who are barely getting by anyway all the sudden
*  The carpet got pulled out from under them
*  People that are at least they're doing uber and they're driving people around they're getting how many comments are gonna lose all of their setups
*  Can hope that they come to their senses and realize how crazy this is in this time to take any job away
*  But I think the problem is some people want it because they want health insurance and they want all sorts of protections as an employee
*  But it's it's a gig. You know that's what they call it like gig employment right right. It's not a job. It's like a career
*  It's just a gig yeah, and you can make a lot of money doing it part-time, and they're like nah fuck you
*  You're making a lot of money. They're not making as much money. You need to give them some of that money
*  They need to be employees. I get the argument. Yeah, isn't Airbnb not allowed to because of coven
*  No, I don't think that's true because I know people have used every
*  Everyone's like side things and shit, but but a lot I bet they're hurting though
*  I've got a lot of people don't want to do it, but the thing about the uber in the lift thing
*  It's like I see both ways because it's like how much money they make off that app and how do they divvy that shit up?
*  Yeah, I see a lot of those drivers in Tesla's not like you must be making some money
*  Maybe that's just a person who wants a Tesla
*  It says if I just work ten hours a day I can afford a right right right right the thing is like who's
*  The uber people and the lift at the people at the own the company how much are they making time?
*  Just having an app yeah, and I think they're not good. I don't think they're they give a great percentage to I
*  Started not liking uber when the drivers could rate you back
*  You back and I would just get in the uber sometimes and say nothing
*  I'd be going to the comedy star working on my act and sometimes people do want to chat
*  And I'm just really quiet, and I would get like four stars
*  Maybe they didn't like your special
*  My talk is gonna be much worse
*  Does lift do the same thing they have that I would only have done uber, but does lift have it the rain?
*  I don't know I got cancer. I got kicked off of lift because I was
*  Mad the driver must ran my foot over once and I left
*  Message on his answering machine like I hope you rot in fucking hell
*  And then they said I abused him and then they asked why and I just went honestly I'm PMS thing
*  Like I see almost hurt me and I'm on my period and I'm really drove over your fucking foot
*  We're trying weren't they trying to change what PMS is called because it was offensive it was
*  Instead of it's me tonight. I'm menstruate. It wasn't a post
*  Mentional dysmorphia aren't they calling it that now didn't we change the morphia yeah dysmorphia body dysmorphia
*  Yeah, they were trying to put tampons in the men's bathroom at Yale because they said sometimes men men straight
*  I think the last time I was on this podcast we talked about it's adorable
*  It's not like being anti-trans it's just you're not allowed to talk about it at all unless you're like completely on the side of
*  I don't want to say it
*  It's like getting canceled you can't just go like I'm standing outside of this situation
*  And I I this side is saying this and this side is saying that and you can't cuz then they're like
*  Here's what you can say we put tampons in the men's room because sometimes
*  Trans women use the men's room and they can still get their period. That's an accurate way of saying that that's a real way
*  You can you can say that
*  Very distinctive ring so when if you call me I know exactly
*  I have the t-rex roar. That's really yeah
*  Dude when are we ever gonna see you? I'm actually starting it said no it's disgusting visit. I'll come back. I only fly private now
*  My favorite part of Austin is it has the largest population of bats
*  And every night people and scientists cancel science cancel science, I'm a Chinese scientist have you seen them fly out from under that
*  Bridge wild yeah at dusk so cool. Yeah, it's really cool as soon as it starts turning dark out
*  They fly out I mean millions of them
*  So fun that's in Austin what's it called moon tower moon tower, but what isn't Austin the only city that still operates moon towers
*  I don't know it is. I don't know I believe it is I never want to and I've never done any of those
*  Yeah, those are good and the Austin City Limits is another one. It also has the only nude beach in Texas
*  I do know that so you've done Austin City Limits. I've done that theater the big theater
*  Paramount is that what it is
*  I don't know, but it's beautiful. Yeah, gorgeous inside. Is that at the Paramount Theater in Austin? It's fucking it's so
*  Moonlight towers only known surviving moonlight towers in the world. What does that mean?
*  They go on at night and it creates light
*  As if it was the moon there everywhere. I don't like seeing only known surviving and then there's a picture of Brody
*  I hate that in a gun under them
*  Jesus Christ
*  It's like fuck
*  I got my Brody pin by the way rock pins
*  Have you been to Austin before? Yeah, I did the moon tower. Oh nice nice. Yeah, they let me do festivals sometimes
*  We're gonna come we're gonna come let Joe hunt us. Come visit. Well, we're gonna take over your studio for our podcast
*  Trauma bonding. Trauma bonding. Well, no you already have one with Bonnie now I'm jealous
*  You're gonna be on it and we're just doing six where it's a limited series
*  Do you think Bonnie's gonna try to put a wedge between you two?
*  Bonnie's the coolest. I talk to Bonnie every day. We laugh all she's the fucking
*  Talking about women aren't funny. It's a fucking what she dressed up like a guy
*  I want to say she looks like Rafi who we were talking about the other day a little bit
*  Yeah, she looked something that made me laugh so hard at that documentary is when?
*  There were shoes like well there are some women that aren't funny and because there's less of us you can make a sort of
*  Stereotype based on one person. So she's like we don't need to get more women in comedy
*  We just have to ask the people that suck to quit
*  She called them a bunch of female comics and she was like, hey, can you stop doing stand-up? It's ruining it
*  You know what my feelings are. It's not the people that suck. It's the people that aren't that good. Those are the dangerous ones
*  It's not the one that suck because the ones that suck everybody knows they suck. Yeah, just kind of never have
*  The ones that are just fucking shit. No, it's the guys their premises are kind of okay
*  The deliveries kind of alright they get so they don't get enough and then they're angry
*  Those are the ones I think it's male comics fault
*  that because if you think about the best pickup line for a
*  Male comic to hit on a female comic is your funny. Yeah, you're really funny. Yeah, like you're funny and then girls like I am
*  Totally worked on me so many see to me
*  I feel like if someone says you're funny or not funny if you just come off stage like
*  I mean look if someone thinks you're funny they if they say it it should register
*  Yeah, the problem is it's you got that male female dynamic. Yeah. Yeah, what's he's trying to fuck me? What is yeah?
*  Well, that's why I like that you find me disgusting and you're
*  I
*  Had to say that in the moment
*  About comedy that does kind of neuter us, you know, I don't feel sexual energy around comics like no offense, right?
*  But there's something it just feels very fraternal
*  I know I never feel sexual what we were talking about at the the comedy store the other night when we're doing the thing
*  It's like there's not that many of us
*  There might be a thousand of us on the planet at a seven billion maybe way less
*  Yeah
*  We're gonna come back and half the comics are gonna have to have moved home
*  I'm gonna get sweet spots at the comedy
*  You will the question is how many clubs are gonna be open the car is gonna stay open
*  But how many clubs will be there's gonna be a lot that go under a lot like maybe half of them in the country
*  What I was hearing was I kept booking dates and canceling and booking and canceling member during that time when it was just chaos
*  We didn't want to just surrender to what the fuck was happening
*  But a lot of clubs wanted us to book knowing we were gonna have to cancel just so they could get some income
*  And then they weren't gonna refund they were just gonna give you a credit
*  I paid money to see Joe Rogan knowing he was
*  And then to go just keep the lights on knowing the show's never gonna happen
*  And then you get a credit to my club
*  Bailed out of all the clubs
*  Become a president it's just so weird because a lot of these clubs are barely functioning without a pandemic
*  Yeah, like Laugh Factory and like maybe some of the smaller outside clubs like haha or ice house
*  They don't do in that great clothes in Boston all those years back. Well, they opened up the Wilbur theater
*  Oh, it's the same. Yeah when when Bill Blumenreit started doing shows the Wilbur the the Wilbur is like what?
*  1200 1300 people so he started getting
*  Literally like a good headliner who would sell out Faneuil Hall, which is like 500 people or 400 people
*  You could actually with his mail list and the fact that comedy so popular in Boston he could sell out the Wilbur
*  I just remember like the Comedy Store. Oh ours my favorite room in the world. Yeah, it's the best
*  It's like the comedy connection that room the Faneuil Hall one the way that it was wide
*  It was shallow and kind of wide with low ceilings. Yeah, I used to get Ari Shaffir so high that he couldn't remember what he
*  I
*  Send him on stage and he was like, I'm too hard. Just so mean
*  Fine I go I go he goes I shouldn't get too high go dude. You can't get fired. You literally can't get fired
*  I'm like you work for me. I know you're funny
*  Fun man, let's kid just go out there drug your friends
*  Ari came to my house like a year ago and was like I need to talk to you and I was like, oh shit
*  Probably not gonna go well, but this is a prank waiting to happen
*  Yeah, get dose or something and he came over he took me on a hike and he was like basically like this is an intervention
*  You need to go get lost somewhere
*  Like I want you to go to Peru for two months without a cell phone or something
*  And I was like you're out of your fucking mind
*  He goes but keep tweeting controversial
*  No, but and then the fucking pandemic happened I was like I should have fucking done that
*  Yeah, but then he's stuck in Thailand or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true
*  A lot of people got stuck in other countries lost in your fucking field of
*  He had he said it because he did it himself and he had great benefit from doing it and he's right on a lot
*  He was off Twitter for a couple months
*  But there's a real benefit to it. I mean, I'm not saying that he's a good person
*  I mean, I'm not saying that he's a good person
*  I mean, I'm not saying that he's a good person
*  Twitter for a couple months
*  There's a real benefit for that
*  You know, there's one of the things that on the one of the first comments so that when I posted that book
*  He was like I'll accept your apology
*  Are you gonna change your cell phone habits now that you already have well, you know that I put on my phone because of you
*  I have a folder called addict at the very end with my social media
*  But now I just scroll seven times to get to it. Oh, you know what I do when I'm healthy
*  Delete all of the the apps so then you have to redownload them and it's just this extra step that's annoying
*  however
*  Do you know what I realized I just kept I would pick my phone up and I would just tap like I'm so addicted to just
*  Happy I just start downloading
*  Was telling me this is a real doctor Huberman said that
*  People when they come out of surgery the first thing they do when they come out of anesthesia is they grab their genitals
*  It's just like a subconscious
*  Still there yes Jesus, but now they reach for their phone. Oh my god. It's better than you dick Wow
*  It's gonna it's gonna be a part of your body
*  It's just a matter of time
*  We're so attached those goddamn things if Elon Musk really falls through with this neural link thing and they
*  Cut a hole in people's head the size of a quarter and stick a bunch of wires in your brain
*  Which is literally what he said they were gonna do and you have some Bluetooth enabled like people read up vaccines
*  Look, hello, but here's the thing
*  What he was saying is it's gonna be a massive advantage for people that have it you're gonna have much more access to information
*  The bandwidth in which you process information be much thicker and wider you're gonna be able to remember her thoughts
*  One day you know what it is it's like we're because there's three of us
*  We're all have shit to say like I'm so excited
*  Everyone always thinks people are on Adderall or coke on your show because it's like so exciting
*  It's not just the irony because you have three hours slow down. It's fine
*  I know but it gets you the energy like we're having a fun conversation is like
*  I got something to say you like you don't know when you jump like puppies they get together
*  Coffee probably let me do my Joey Diaz impression. Hey Joe Rogan. I like it. He calls you Joe Rogan
*  So if today someone said we can schools can open up clubs can open up venues can open up
*  We can go back to normal if you wear this bracelet
*  That tells me where you are at all times where you were last night and who you hung out with
*  This is the problem with it. The same problem was shutting down the tick-tock house. It's cuz okay you shut down a house that has 200 people
*  What if it gets down to five?
*  What if they tell you you have to split your family up?
*  What if you have ten people in your house? You can't have more than ten, right?
*  What if you have to have grandma comes over can't come over who the fuck are they?
*  Yeah, to tell you you can't have a party you have mismanaged this crisis
*  So horribly at every step of the way and not just the city and not just the state the federal government and of course
*  the people that were
*  Releasing the information from Wuhan
*  That's the that's the big step because they're the ones who fucked it up because there was a lot of legit
*  Doctors and scientists that were in Wuhan
*  Chinese doctors they were trying to get the word out and they were silenced and the main one the first one that did it
*  Actually wind up dying from the fucking crazy. It's crazy, right?
*  So that's that's the biggest fuck-up, but there's fuck-ups every step of the way
*  One of the biggest fuck-ups that's happening right now
*  Is these people being in a position of power and telling people that they can't work telling people they can't do things tell them
*  But you can protest you saw the governor's got shut down right, but yeah, I did see that
*  Yeah, Tim Dillam's supposed to be there. Governor's in Long Island the comedy club
*  You can't have a person that just because they win a popularity contest make new rules
*  You can't give them the power to make new rules because everybody becomes a fucking tyrant and there's what they're doing
*  They all they're doing is protect people you tell me how many fucking hospital beds you have
*  You tell me what the death rate is and then you tell me why this is the only state in the country that can that can't
*  Open a beauty salon the beauty salons can't be open right now only California. They're crazy
*  This is it's a crazy state and they open them for a second and then took it away
*  Maybe it's because we don't pay no taxes
*  Christ in the uber shit. I never pay tipping point. This is that bad people are gonna wake the fuck up. No, it's fine
*  Nobody knows let's just say on paper me and Wesley Snipes have a lot in common
*  Do they don't fuck around they find you I'm having my I'm not talking about this actually
*  Fine
*  But this the state is just they're terrible at it and the fact that they can shut down these tick tockers
*  We should be nervous not because these tick tockers are geniuses
*  But it's because who the fuck are you to say you can shut the power off Wow you can shut someone's power off
*  Someone's power off
*  They're taking their
*  They're shutting the lights off in the house right doing they're cutting off the water
*  But if you do that, but you're saying that you have the ability to shut off
*  Essentials things that keep people alive water and power and you're saying that you have the ability to tell them how they can live
*  In this house and
*  There's no real law that says you can limit the amount of people that can go to a party
*  Right don't think there is I'll tell you where this does not happen Texas no
*  My mom is from Texas. Yeah, you do not get to tell people from Texas what to fucking do except don't smoke weed
*  Yeah, I said weed. What are we gonna do about that?
*  I'm gonna have the what occupancy laws and shit like that like the amount of people that can be in place
*  But if you can't change them, can you can you make it a house?
*  Like if a house is you know
*  Normally has a party like Dan Bilzerian's place if you're in college and you have too many people at your house
*  They'll come and shut it down right, but that's the cops and that's not your house
*  If the people who own the house have some sort of a regulation maybe I could see it
*  But if you like Dan Bilzerian didn't own that house either and the whole thing about that house
*  It would piss off the neighbors was cuz he would just bus in people and they'd fill that place up and DJs and
*  Marshmallows there and shit. Everybody's going crazy, but they didn't shut his power off
*  so they're saying they're saying they have the ability to shut your power and water off because
*  During the pandemic they can limit the amount of people in your house
*  So that's a new rule because if they were having these occupancy laws Dan Bilzerian would have gotten shut down. That's right
*  They're doing it because they're saying you could spread kovat this way and it's irresponsible
*  The problem is the way that they're doing something new
*  Yeah, shutting power off on someone's house that doesn't listen
*  There's shutting power off on someone who's having a party who doesn't obey but didn't they have and they're doing it for press to kind
*  Of let people know what's up
*  Threat and this is the same fucking guy that offered rewards for people who turn folks in remember the whole thing
*  Oh, yeah, get stitches. Well now stitches get rewards if people are social distancing
*  And that was for small parties that's remember that was for people having fucking barbecues
*  This shit is slippery. Do you think I'm gonna get shut because I'm starting a stand-up show in my backyard just for comics
*  We're gonna do testing like what Chappelle is doing in Ohio. I'm gonna do in my backyard because it's just getting crazy
*  Am I gonna shut down? I don't know but you're gonna let everybody know where you live. No, it's gonna be
*  It's basically gonna be like a bringer show. It's gonna be like comic bring like two friends that you trust to know
*  So guys if you join my patreon
*  I
*  Might try to shoot some stuff like why not why not?
*  I just wonder what is the law like see if we can find out if there's any written thing
*  How many people can I have I don't know?
*  Yeah, like what what is the law now in LA if these tick-tockers have too many people?
*  I'm gonna have like five comics and because when I started I think you should just be arrested if that's a law
*  I think you should be fined or something. I don't think you should be able to shut someone's fucking power
*  Great all right. Bye. Yeah, if like if these tick-tockers like hey, you guys are violating the law
*  So here's a fine of $200
*  This what things make sense if you're finding someone for something if you're if you park in the wrong place
*  You can get fined but there's a thing that they're doing. That's weird. They're shutting power off
*  Ordinance on loud or unruly gatherings known as the party house ordinance. Hey Dan Belzerian that ever work on you officially took place August 15
*  2018 they never use it on him the ordinance claims to curb repeat offenders of out-of-control parties of residential neighborhoods with escalating fines and new
*  Enforcement from Los Angeles Police Department. I don't think that's connected though
*  2018 is that like a blanket statement. I don't think that's connected to the tick-tock house. These are all 2018 stories
*  We were also in a heat wave it was a hundred and seven you can't cut off someone's electricity in a hundred and seven
*  Exactly, exactly wild and we're all we're assuming their kids
*  To be there, okay here
*  Property owners who skirt building and safety rules or city laws such as Los Angeles party house ordinance was the same law, right?
*  Are in violation of kovat 19 public health orders in the city's party house ordinance, which becomes the law in 2018
*  So they're talking about that law and it said it wasn't clear whether Garcetti's announcement was related to that motion
*  Okay, what?
*  It's still exactly they're making up as they go along it's still sneaky
*  I like the proposal penalties for large gatherings could include water and power shutoff, huh?
*  permit
*  Prohibitions and having a certificate of occupancy held or revert revoked for large
*  close contact largely maskless gatherings in violation of city
*  Emergency orders and County health order so the city emergency in the County health order
*  They make an order saying you can't have a large gathering and if you do they're gonna do a new thing
*  Which is shut your water and power off when do they fucking never do that unless you're a fugitive you have to have like a gun
*  Yeah pointing it out the window
*  We're always at risk of fires and now you're making people use candlelight
*  Slippery thing
*  I think it's stupid that these kids want to have these parties and we were talking about dr
*  Malkin and all these people that came to him that got sick from one of those parties
*  You can get sick for sure and there's probably you know
*  It's it's a high likelihood that people are gonna die if they keep getting sick and they infect someone you know out of you know
*  It's like zero. It's point zero four percent of people who catch COVID die. That's what the current standings are
*  So it could lead to a death or two it is possible
*  But I just I just don't think you should allow people to do that
*  The
*  Steve Bannon was busted by the mail. Did you know that the mail could make arrests the Daily Mail the man?
*  It was the Postal Service. They like a
*  That's who arrested
*  Girls are talking about politics I have to pee so bad
*  You guys keep going I'll pee
*  Arrested Steve Bannon is that cool. Let's read it look at his face
*  He looks like Javier Bardem
*  I'm gonna be Joseph Rogan the US Postal Service is out to deliver justice against former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon
*  It may not come as a shock that Bannon often described as a grifter was allegedly caught up in a scheme to defraud
*  Yeah, they have fucking police isn't that crazy I hate when they take tweets from this drives me nuts when journalists take tweets from people
*  I don't know who fucking this person is and then they post their tweet as if it's real journalism
*  Journalism and look they only have 322 likes on the tweet. It's not even a popular
*  They're part and parcel of an elite police unit known as the US Postal
*  Inspection service USP is which has been fighting crime since the mail
*  Fraud probably you and your tax fraud you're gonna meet these people soon
*  You're gonna know these people any minute. There's
*  1200 postal inspectors who carry weapons make arrests execute federal search warrants and serve subpoenas
*  They've even inspired a CBS series the inspectors haven't heard of it. Yeah
*  They made five thousand seven hundred fifty nine arrests
*  Can you imagine since put your hands?
*  1872
*  Have you ever been arrested?
*  No, I got like, you know when I was in high school, we were bad, but I never got arrested
*  I got like the cut once we took a three-foot bong out into the alleyway to smoke for some reason in high school
*  And then obviously neighbors were like the kids are smoking a giant bong and the thing said yeah the cops came in
*  We were so high we were like trying to hide behind the bomb like so tragic
*  But my one friend who had the weed on him got arrested, but I got arrested
*  But do you still smoke weed out of bongs or just do joints? Um
*  Sometimes I I mean, I don't really smoke that much weed anymore. I started again and now I'm remembering why I don't
*  the old early on
*  My phone number I want to be as alert as possible I like to be able to pay attention and chime in and stuff but
*  Yeah, I'll smoke out of a bong. I think I was my throat was getting really fucked up from the vapes. Yeah
*  Oh, I don't yeah, I don't I don't like vaping
*  I don't think it gets me high enough remember when we thought vapes were like healthier than cigarettes
*  Are they remember when we were like vapes are healthy. Oh, you're showing my patreon. It's a big factor
*  So long picture I was I look up wait
*  Huh what nothing she asked if she's smoking up a bong. I'll show you I did have a three-foot
*  Smoke weed and I want to tase you I had a three-foot. I mean I'm a little bit interested. I do like attention
*  I like attention, but I also like not we're following David Blaine the bar is high
*  What were we just talking about? I caught whatever you had though. I had a service the postal service cameras people
*  There's 1,200 people that can arrest people they carry weapons
*  And they arrested him for fraud is it for fraud for raising money for that private border wall right not wild?
*  Wild
*  Kill cliff
*  Little buzz at all or no just good for like pain and stuff yeah 25 milligrams
*  I'm trying to find this picture. I have a picture
*  I had a three-foot bong for a second and for Mother's Day one year
*  I dressed it up like like it was a boy. I put a hat on it, and I was like sending my son to school
*  I put a little backpack on him
*  This is delicious
*  It's tough right kill cliff do you think that?
*  Instagram is gonna be replaced by reals
*  Well really isn't Instagram
*  But I mean it's like at one point because now your algorithm like you have to get a certain number of likes and comments in
*  Order to get an algorithm at all right
*  Which is harder and is reals like more. It's like a tick-tock on it
*  Just Rob's it's great like what it did with that to Instagram did stories when you know
*  I've got you know kind of went away right I haven't started in the reals yet, but I'm excited
*  I love having this outlet especially during this time where we can't do stand-up
*  I love I love Instagram a lot of comics just like promoter don't or lay their dog in there
*  What I love that I don't you like a movie break comedians and make them so successful
*  But I really love the making jokes on it's like my favorite yeah, it's a great place to do it
*  It's a fun way to like just you post a picture and say something funny. It's a little writing exercise
*  It's also like like journalists are so fucking lazy now like news is just
*  Jennifer Lopez posted this thing on Instagram. They just take all their news and all their photos from Instagram now
*  Yeah, you know me stories get written just from shit. We say on this podcast just
*  Story, it's crazy. Well. I'll see you and like the internet like Twitter will be up
*  You posted a picture with me and
*  Owen Smith I believe and it was like one of the days you said one thing
*  I don't even remember what it was
*  But the internet had blown and I could tell cuz I was tagged in the picture of you so all these people were commenting
*  And I saw you later, and it was not a different day for you in any way
*  You are not effect you were I was like I wonder if he like cuz it was just like boom boom boom
*  I was getting all these notifications. I was just so funny that you didn't even that's probably when I didn't like video games or something
*  Did you I feel like you got maybe it was like I feel like two years ago
*  You got like super famous like super super super famous. Did it feel like it was like two years ago
*  I always thought you were so famous. I don't know what happened. You're always famous. You were famous, but then you became a religion
*  I think it's a cumulative thing if you just keep moving
*  Yeah, keep putting out podcasts and people more and more people listen to them and then too many people listening to you
*  Right then it becomes this thing yeah, and then it's like every word you say is
*  Also, I'm a fucking moron which is a terrible thing like if people are getting advice from me
*  Yeah, I don't even take my own advice a lot of times don't listen
*  Yeah
*  That's why you're fun to listen to and talk to is because you're like humble and you're willing to entertain ideas that aren't yours
*  And you're asked the right questions
*  I think it's so important that we're talking about before the don't get married to your ideas
*  I've been married to my ideas before it's gross
*  It's gross because then you defend them and you lie and you manipulate your words to try to make it seem like you're right when you're
*  Not right. I think it was in that uh that same book
*  We brought up so many times you get dopamine when your bias is confirmed for confirmation bias when
*  Someone agrees with a wrong idea that you say you get dopamine. I used to enjoy
*  Winning like arguments like that and now I want it
*  I like honestly like when I have someone on the podcast
*  Saying something really ridiculous that I know is horseshit that I'm like, okay
*  This is my opportunity to just exercise this thing and I want I'll just speak nice and slow and like why do you think that?
*  Like what what is it? What's going on?
*  Like tell me how you make and what about this and I'll give them opposing ideas, but I won't be married to them
*  I'll say well that doesn't make any sense because this yeah, but I'm not saying in a mean way
*  I'm like I'm trying to I try like when someone's like
*  Especially someone say something real that they don't even really think through they just this is like a predetermined pattern of behavior
*  a conglomeration of ideas that I've adopted as this ideology and I'm gonna push this forward no matter what and
*  Those people are fascinating because when you talk to them, they are fucking married to those ideas. They don't even know them
*  They're married to strangers and you're arguing with them about some shit
*  They haven't thought through it all and they um and they are I've had people fall apart and it's so fascinating because look I've been wrong
*  Thousand times on this fucking podcast or more, but when there's a moment if I know I'm wrong, I'll be like, okay
*  That's not right and that's this specific podcast today all the time everything you've said it
*  But you yeah, you are able to change your mind after getting new information
*  Isn't science like that you're trying to prove yourself wrong you're trying to like yeah, it's ego
*  But even in science, it's a real issue when people come up with new scientific discoveries that other scientists didn't recognize
*  There's a lot of fucking blowback a lot of people get angry scientists get pissy. Yeah, really egotistical
*  It's super super disheartening when you take all of your information from like archaeologists
*  But then one archaeologists will find some new discovery that like predate civilization like I've seen it with Graham Hancock
*  I've seen it with a Graham Hancock. I've seen it with Robert shock because his geologist from Boston University
*  He was talking to this archaeologist about these geological findings that show water erosion and the outside of the Sphinx that could have only taken
*  Place at 9000 BC which would predate all that Egyptian construction like way earlier than they thought it was and this guy's mocking
*  Him and laughing at a scientist and instead of going fascinating because this is his field of study
*  He's a fucking geologist. Okay, and he's saying these water marks can only be created by erosion. This is water erosion
*  This is not wind and sand. This is water. They sing I made geologists
*  I have sent these images this cropped images to other geologists. They've agreed with me. This guy's just mocking him
*  I'm like, oh my god, it's ego
*  Yeah
*  He doesn't want to think that he's been teaching and writing books right all these years about how old the Sphinx is how old the pyramids are
*  And he's been wrong and he doesn't want to know you're like, oh no
*  So it exists in everything even in the people that we rely on the most for information true. They're married to their ideas
*  He should have been fascinated. She'd be like wow. Well, I have to revise my book
*  New book dude, yeah, then you get this crazy new discovery that oh look
*  It looks like there's many errors of construction because if you go deep deep deep into the sand
*  There's an older era and it's a very distinctive era
*  They built things differently then and then this era does they do it this way and so they can get it narrowed down to these epochs
*  It's fucking fascinating. But meanwhile, this guy's ego wouldn't let them see it and you watch it. You know, wow
*  What what civilization was from 14,000 years?
*  While they've since then they've found them they found actual civilization like go Beckley Tepe
*  That's a hundred percent more than 12,000 years old
*  100% without a doubt was filled in 12,000 years ago
*  So the guy was wrong, but meanwhile his ideas were his he clutched him like a baby was protecting from a storm
*  Yeah, there's so much of that in medicine, especially when there's new solutions and shit, you know, like I was reading about the
*  Board certification for veterinarians a lot of these veterinarians have to learn wrong information to pass this test to get board certified
*  Oh, no, that's already been debunked because it's like older veterinarians something that was true 30 years ago
*  Now has been debunked and they have to like learn all this archaic shit just to pass this arbitrary test
*  Well, remember the food chain
*  Eat five servings of bread a day
*  Fish
*  One little piece of steak the fact that we used to think that shit was good for us
*  Well, then I can't read cream cheese and and beef and didn't eat. I
*  Know this is the thing people always like to see this Atkins fell on the ice and broke his head
*  Well, cuz he was off balance from all that cream cheese
*  Remember I was taught when I was a kid the healthiest thing you could eat was like a blueberry muffin
*  No
*  I've been eating a lot of blueberry muffins and they really do make you look like a blueberry
*  No, I like my the problem is it looks good at all weights, so it's hard to lose weight
*  But you also look like you're like it fucking strong as shit. I look fertile. You're like, yeah
*  You look like a fucking brick opposite of barren. Yeah
*  Do you work out hard like are you I do I like to work out a lot
*  Enjoy working out does that was that ever a thing that like helped you and you're getting over booze
*  It was like exercise. Yeah, I started doing yoga because I was very detached to my femininity
*  obviously I got into this job my family but my mom is like my mom's very like
*  Sportsy they can't use the word I want to say but um, you know
*  She so she was always very like let's just play sports no dolls all this stuff
*  So I had no attachment to and then with yoga
*  I kind of got really like girly and it and it helped me and just the body weight stuff really helped
*  Yeah, but now and I like doing jujitsu, but I'm not fucking doing jujitsu during the shit
*  Well, you were doing it no gee too, which is you know, you're in like fucking light
*  It's so sweaty and so gross I know you can contract it through ball sweat. I know
*  For sure, but you it does improve your immune system. That's what's interesting fun though. It was the most fun
*  It's the most fun exercise. You're doing math problems on people's bodies. It's incredible. That is what it's like
*  Yeah, it's so cool. But you know what I wanted to ask you. I can't get weights anywhere. They don't sell weights anymore
*  I know it's hard. What can you get they you if they're sold out of weights?
*  I've been in quarantine. Oh, I've been trying to get in shape and that nuts like cuz no gyms are open
*  That's the other thing California all these gyms. How many of these gyms are gonna stay open
*  Did you see those ridiculous those pods where they had like people were surrounded and like
*  Pods working out. So we're in zip. I'll get some weights. Yeah
*  Hey
*  You tell me what I'm doing. No better than me. Okay, our gyms ever gonna be the same
*  Well, no, no, I think this is first of all, it's gonna yeah, maybe but like three years from now
*  It's gonna take a while for people to get over this shit. Also the online stuff
*  I think that everything a lot of things can exist online and it sucks cuz it's harder with willpower
*  I think like doing a yoga class on a zoom is very different for me like I like taking classes because I get competitive
*  I
*  To me it's just part of my motivation whether it's healthy or not, you know
*  Or like the instructor yelling at you or whatever trying to like impress somebody. Yeah, whatever the fuck, you know, yeah
*  Yeah, that's why the you're not gonna get that from zoom. It's definitely it's like zoom comedy, right? Right
*  Like Mark Norman said it was like methadone comedy
*  We have worked our whole lives to you know get precise timing and like a two-second delay changes fucking everything
*  You know, it's like, you know, right by second like yeah
*  I was doing a comedy out of the window at the store and it was like you couldn't have it at the same time and they
*  Ended up not being able to do it because the regulation stuff, but yeah, they had to have a 10-second delay. Oh
*  And it was I was doing like a podcast with Eleanor Kerrigan my fucking angel and
*  We were like joking and stuff but that delay so I would say something that I was like this is gonna fuck
*  Should be talking I'd be half listening to and looking at waiting 10 seconds like one Mississippi to me and then I look and it
*  Would bomb and like fuck it wasn't good
*  Amazing how we're so conditioned to have that immediate gratification that like clap
*  Yeah, and then just even on zoom like doing like talk shows or zoom podcast
*  Which I really do not like doing just that that one second fucks up the flow and the chemistry
*  It's also there's an energy that people have when they're in the room with you
*  Like that's one of the things that comedy does that people don't talk about it's like a hypnosis thing going on
*  There's a sharing of energy the laughs or you're physically feeling them. It's a symbiotic relationship
*  It's like we do need each other
*  And also the energy that the audience gets from each other being shoulder to shoulder with another person that contagious and also like yeah
*  The home court advantage of you're in my fucking house. You're in your bed snuggled up
*  Cozy
*  Options yeah, you're going to be looking at something else at any time
*  I try to explain to non comics that if you watch a comedy special someone's comedy special
*  That's maybe 70% as good as seeing
*  Most tough because filming a special is like kind of tense
*  Yeah, so you're not loose and when you're loose you're funny
*  so it's hard for people to be loose and then it's also weird because that
*  The fucking not being in the room thing is like 30 or 40 percent
*  It's like this feeling that you get when you're there when you're like
*  Right now hi yeah, it's right there, but when you watch it at home. You're just sitting back, and you're you're alone
*  I was trying to cut out a lot of applause breaks and stuff on specials because at home
*  Yeah, she cuts out the applause break
*  All the standing ovations just got a bit much
*  No, but I just mean like when they're there they're gonna laugh a little longer at home
*  They're like ha ha moot now move on you know what I mean
*  You don't want to hear that like have them have to hear other people laugh. I always add some in you know
*  That is weird
*  Did a special for her just her parents
*  Shooting specials for small crowds that she's hilarious. She's so funny that sounds like something she would do
*  She did stand up just for her parents on the couch in their living room
*  I like what a like a uniquely herself person
*  She is it's just my favorite thing in people everybody tried kovat comedy a while ago remember when
*  What was the comics name that put that special out on HBO with no audience at all?
*  Directed it oh no, I know
*  What's that drew Michael drew Michael yeah drew Michael did a special with no audience
*  Was weird, but it was like he took a swing. I always appreciate a swing. I always appreciate
*  Hey, why I mean because it's a different thing right they used to be like live
*  Performances that weren't really stand up like do you remember Eric Boghossian? Yes? Yeah, he used to do these live
*  Performances that were they were not really stand up there were these things
*  You know there were these stories you would tell right yeah, you remember that yeah, I remember that remember
*  There's this guy Josh Fadum. Did you ever know him? Yes? He's so funny
*  He would do crazy shit like he would go on stage and just like
*  Run in place, and it was like so weird
*  It's like not funny
*  And then he would just like keep doing it and like people start walking out
*  Keep running in place, and then by three minutes in you're dying laughing, and you have no idea why
*  He'll do a thing where he like accidentally fucks up the mic and it falls apart
*  And he's like ah but it's so funny gets like tangled up in it
*  And it's like you want to hate honestly like as a comic like I'm looking at your face
*  But it's so like it's charmingly funny. It's just some weird like thought exercise
*  Something Reggie watts to like he learned how to make sounds funny
*  Do you know what I mean like Reggie can do so many different things the thing about Reggie's he's like Josh Fadum's big moment
*  Shooting at a fucking comedy
*  Lights are they Josh you had a shot Jamie really blew it for you. That admits you short sex dungeon. What was that?
*  The darkness of the stage is confusing like yeah, I'm not want the comedians
*  Like how dark the main room got do you remember what I'm talking about when they just the week before yeah
*  Then they put those like lights up those like crazy LED lights. Yeah, I think I like I was getting used to it
*  It looked the pictures looked beautiful that's why I was taking when you guys think it comes back
*  We're all guessing like everything we're talking about I had booked the La Jolla Comedy Store for two weeks and shut down um I
*  Think it's gonna be six months to a year
*  I
*  Just moved my tour to fall 2021 theaters
*  If someone can figure out the ventilation system if there's some I don't know why this we're not figuring this out
*  Well if someone comes up with a rapid test that's gonna fix everything yeah, that's a rapid test you test someone as they're walking in
*  It's a long ass line lines gonna take a lot longer than it will normally, but you have holding rooms, right?
*  You know it would be amazing you could have you would completely get rid of the virus if you could do like how long is it gonna?
*  Take for our emotional trauma to heal of like remember the days when you were just being a comedy club and a waitress in
*  The dark would hand you a drink with a straw you just put it right everything's gonna be different our whole
*  Earth is gonna be different
*  I mean imagine just taking a drink from a girl at a bar and putting it in your mouth
*  Fouchy was saying that we're not gonna be able to shake hands anymore. We're not gonna be able to date rape drug people anymore
*  It's like so upsetting
*  You can't slip me the drug anymore
*  I mean it's like what is this doing to our brains just in terms of making us go closer and closer to virtual reality
*  Yeah, don't you think it's like an ego death?
*  I feel like we've all been forced into this epic dose of mushrooms that we didn't mean to take and it's like everyone has
*  To face their mortality which I think is all we're doing all day anyway, but it's now it's like oh, we're watching death
*  We're there's the death of our of being entertained. There's the death of going out
*  There's the death of meeting people the death of shaking hands the death of actual people
*  And I think it was Tim Dylan and I were talking about how like 9-eleven everyone's like comparing this to 9-eleven in some ways
*  And the fact that it's just like a trauma, but 9-eleven like brought us together
*  You know it was like there was this like let's go out till 2 in the morning
*  They're not gonna fucking win and everyone was instantly friends with each other and now everyone's instant enemies with each other
*  I walked down the street and people where the fuck put your pull your fucking mask the mask stuff so funny people are so crazy
*  The mask stuff is crazy. Well not only that. Their default is fuck you. It's like outside in the Sun like hey, man
*  It's not even possible. You don't even know what this is dude
*  There was a guy I went to Venice Beach
*  And there was a guy in a wheelchair who and I used to work with kids especially so I always like to make iconic
*  Say hello to don't keep on wheelchairs the one sentence that makes you the most likable. I was a special ed
*  I whatever no big deal. I'm a hero
*  gave it up to tell dick jokes to do God's work, but
*  So I always like to acknowledge because there's such people don't want to be rude
*  So they want to stare and then they're never looked at they're never talked about
*  That's why I'm always like do jokes about people milk like do like do ever like make them a part of things
*  Right, but I always will you'll joke about of course. Yeah, it's like there's no punching down like shut the fuck up
*  but so
*  so I was like I was doing my little like aren't I a good citizen like I contacted this guy and goes
*  We're fucking mascot
*  It was so funny I was like
*  Was it was one of my vlog days my new vlog only on patreon
*  But and it was like I just turned the thing off because I didn't want to focus on I didn't want to be like
*  I'm videotaping a guy in a wheelchair, but it literally wouldn't the funniest thing that's ever happened
*  It's amazing that cunt is the most offensive word, but if someone calls me a cunt
*  Like we need a new work is if a guy calls me a cunt like I'll start
*  Women though, there's not enough her immunity. We need herd immunity
*  antibodies
*  Like it's so funny that's what we're saying that I like someone said cunt both of us
*  It's such a good word it's so good. It's short. It's cutting. Yeah, it's got a T at the end of it
*  Yeah, I still like bitch bitch is still pretty good for me if someone calls me bitch. I'm like damn bitch is softer than cunt though
*  Yeah, for sure as a sound the thing is like the thing about cunt is the sound that is sharp razor sharp
*  Calling a guy is always like oh, yeah
*  I use it really good time for men. Yeah, I call that men cunts
*  Yeah, but if a guy calls me a bitch there's something so 90s about it. There's something so retro
*  Yeah, you know you go to England in Australia though. They toss it around like a beach ball
*  That's what's weird and my bitch is their cunt right? I don't know. What is their cunt Fanny is there?
*  Use it that much for girls though they use it for each other
*  Yeah, it's a jokey term like hey, what's up fucker? Yeah, like they hey man. It was up cunt
*  He's a good cunt like he's a good cunt normal thing for them to say so it feels like you fucking cunt
*  They come over here, and they you know they realize that oh Jesus. I got a remap my my language
*  Yeah, cuz cunt is like a different thing over here. It's dangerous the one that gets me is fuckface
*  I
*  Think of one that gets me I can I either is one
*  But I can't think of fuckface you can get away with too, and it's got it
*  But it's got so much power fuckface
*  The thing that throws me actually is when other women call me hooker or whore when a girl's like hey whore
*  I'm like Jesus
*  Disorganizes me it's your friend so it's like hey hooker. Hey slut
*  Doing that for a while they're calling each other hooker
*  Well sometimes I'll be like you're a slut like sometimes like wow you are a fucking slut
*  Yeah, but you gotta be like funny
*  We're saying guys can't call us this but I wonder they're confused if you don't want that anymore close your legs
*  You've been shitting like a whore the whole time
*  Are you being a boy or a whore?
*  These chairs I think are like ergonomic chairs. I think they're to give birth in or something. I don't know what's happening
*  I feel like I'm really good for your back. Is this a simian? What's happening?
*  Yeah, I feel like I get out of here and my posture is always like so much so I think we came to a serious conclusion
*  That you guys need your own show like legitimately. Okay. What are we gonna do here?
*  I think you legitimately need to do it. Can we have the sauna too and everything?
*  Just have it. What are we gonna do it? We're gonna take calls or give advice
*  Yeah, maybe we trauma bond with someone calls in and we trauma bond with them and you guys need like a neon sign behind you
*  I want to die that says any fucking letterman so bad behind me on my podcast
*  I want it so bad
*  If anybody wants to buy me that neon pay for my eggs to get frozen
*  20 grand
*  Boy you can name it if it's a girl you can know
*  Okay, all right, I'm gonna name it butch
*  I'm gonna name it cut
*  And he's little frozen cunts that should be the name of the next special
*  Do you want kids maybe yeah, you should have a kid maybe I feel like I'd be a really I think I went there
*  So much I think I'd be a really good mom Mike. My nieces are like my fucking favorite
*  My nephews to I love them so much. I don't want to say I don't but I talked to my nieces nephews every day
*  Yeah, I love them. Yeah, my niece is eight. We've been pet. We just started becoming pen pals. Yeah, I've this video
*  Now that the mail is gonna be canceled well, they don't I know just one movie came
*  But my little niece who's four she oh my oh my god, my eight-year-old sent me
*  I gave her a snow globe of Hollywood and I was like whenever you miss me there in Boston
*  I'm like whenever you miss me just think about and so she sent me it was four years ago
*  Senator and she sent me a picture of the snow globe and she goes I think about you all the time auntie. I miss you so much
*  It's like I'm gonna get those rapid tests
*  Like I that biological collection it's real I look at babies and I'm like I want to fucking put that baby in my mouth
*  I also look at that's sorry
*  I have like a compulsion for when I squeeze them. Yes
*  I just I don't want to miss out on like the
*  Experience like we are on this earth to have kids. Yeah, I don't it doesn't look that fun
*  I mean when it's only purpose is to bear children any you know
*  But it does it doesn't look that fun
*  You know my friends seem very happy and tired
*  But it doesn't like a lot and but I just when I look at my side two brothers my twin brother has two girls
*  And my older brother is two boys. I'll have a hermaphrodite, but
*  It's like a perfect like it's just like they're so perfect. They're so cute
*  I see other people's kids. I'm like I want them. Yeah, I love them
*  Yeah, I just I want to be back in session. I think I would be I think I would I think it took a lot of fun
*  You'd be a fun mom. I do have a compulsion to adopt though
*  I don't know it's I rescue animals so much that it's sort of is like and then kind of like getting your kid from a breeder
*  Getting your kids
*  Should I adopt a kid too? Did you see that Sia the?
*  singer adopted like 18 and 19 year old to black guys
*  Okay, like she adopted. I don't know how you adopt a grown man. She just did
*  I thought I didn't know you could adopt people that were over 18. Maybe they got some weird thing they're doing
*  She's like 40 something I think every guy you've ever dated is basically been adopted
*  You pay for them you take my med like I like my dog. How many comedians do you think you've dated?
*  Um like three uh-huh
*  Is it weird that I haven't dated any comedians no it's smart no it's
*  Thank you
*  I honestly and I think I'm done with like I'm like I think I went through all the ones I dated one ever
*  When I was open mic her and I was like oh, she's like me
*  It's constant it is fun. It's really fun. Is there a little bit of a like whose bit is that as mine?
*  No, you're in a fight
*  I guess you could if you were you were like if you like sort of
*  Workshops a bit together. Yeah
*  I have that or if you take it. I'm gonna tell people you raped me
*  Sorry, there's a weird relationship though when a woman comic and a male comic get together
*  And then one of them is right in the other ones jokes you can tell and you're like oh, that's her writing
*  That's his right
*  If I write a joke for someone and I'm in the back of the room and someone's like doing the bit and it gets the biggest
*  Laugh obviously cuz that really does happen cuz I'm so good, but you're a great joke writer
*  No, but I like I cannot help but going like
*  Gavin Newsom do I get money if I rat out that I wrote that joke
*  It's Garcetti is the one who wants to give you a study
*  But if you ever dated a comedian, I think if I was dating comic and I saw them do poorly
*  I wouldn't be able to fuck them again. I will be rough
*  If I don't respect someone I have a hard time well, I wouldn't like yeah
*  You can't like openly date somebody you don't respect if you're dating a girl and she's a comic and she sucks that is going
*  To be rough too for a guy as well, right and then all the time she gets real good
*  Should that she passes you using your jokes be rough
*  I I don't know it is it's a fun experience like I do remember that but you can also do that in just friendships with
*  Comics, but I just have so many people I call about jokes. It's so fun
*  But I for me I had some Darwinian instinct to be like do not piss where you eat
*  Like do not toxify this environment. This is the only place you feel safe is the only place
*  That's like why any of these guys if they were like DM me I was like, you know
*  I think some girls feel like no one gets them but comics and that's why you see girl comics wind up with male comics
*  Cuz like for a woman to be the funny one
*  I think there's a lot of guys that are intimidated by that
*  Like if a guy was a regular guy with a regular job and he's dating a funny comic who's going on stage murdering
*  The main room
*  It's a different kind of person but there's a lot of guys can't for sure
*  I mean everybody's different but there are a lot of guys who have a problem with the woman being right
*  Well, also you have to this happens a lot where a guy who has nothing to do with comedy is like really into you
*  And you're like, oh great like a man and then they see you do stand up and they're like into it and then they go
*  You know, I always kind of wanted to get into comedy
*  You know Kurt told me this because I used to always feel like if someone hit on me
*  They didn't think I was funny or something
*  He's like they could be hitting on you because they like it that you're funny
*  but here's the difference between men and women right here and there because if there was a guy and
*  He's dating a girl and she's like, you know, I always thought about doing comedy guy. But you should
*  Stupid they wouldn't even realize the girls fucking them
*  The girl lets the guy fucker
*  I'll help you write jokes. It's not even like saying I don't want you to be a comedian
*  It's just saying I don't want to date an open mic or like course
*  You're gonna start you're gonna humiliate me by being the worst comedian in the room. This is the difference between men and women
*  If a girl's hot a guy will still fuck her even if she's an open mic. Yeah
*  You'll take her to the show
*  Yeah
*  Here's some dude who's like a headline around the road in theaters and you got this really pretty girlfriend
*  Also wants to be a comic you like
*  And I think I fucked myself a couple times because I always felt like okay don't emasculate this guy laugh at his jokes
*  So I would laugh at his jokes that weren't funny and then he'd be like, well, she thinks I'm funny
*  I must be hilarious
*  He want to start doing stand-up on the spectrum do that. I have a lot of trouble fake laughing
*  My face is like I like look at them. I remember Tony once being like I see what you're doing
*  You're not laughing and I was like Tony
*  It's just was like too punny in this moment and I just like can't fake laughs
*  Yeah, Tony's not that Tony's not the fucking funny
*  Puns there's no one has better puns and Tony over this quarantine. I've gotten so close with Tony
*  I love I get him. I love him. He's awesome. I
*  Accept his craziness
*  Or I remember when Tony's when Tony didn't he go vegan?
*  Then he started eating meat. I remember when he was in bad shape
*  I remember when he was a door guy and he was like a mess and I used to yell at him
*  Yeah cigarettes. He thought that being vegan was gonna help him like a place his health
*  Well, he lost a lot of weight like it was he doesn't need to lose a thin guy. He's tiny
*  He's got a crazy metabolism like you can eat everything and just goes just burns off him. Yeah, he's gonna be so happy
*  We're talking about him
*  Do you know Mitch Burroughs is he's a he's at the Comedy Store to you so funny. He's a door guy
*  He's so funny though. He's one of the guys that like that's his way into the Comedy Store
*  We were talking about that we were doing the documentary to it's one of the coolest things about the store
*  Everybody gets treated like a comic the door people the people that work the cover booth
*  It doesn't matter if you're if you're a comic you're a comic
*  Yeah, and we a lot of us like whether it's Duncan or Ari or so many people started out as door people
*  So many guys so many guys and I think the common denominator the communist or comics is these are people that want it and at all
*  Fucking costs like people like your commister comic that place is toxic
*  It's like you're throwing shit around like that. I spent from 5 p.m
*  To in the morning every night for like four years like you know it's sort of the amount of time we put in it's not
*  Toxic it's not it's a wild place and sometimes weird shit happens there
*  And sometimes you know it's annoying and sometimes people bomb and sometimes people feel like they bomb because the person before them was to
*  Do that there's a lot look. It's it's a fucking dangerous place like I've had shitty sets
*  It's a nightclub like one of them when you remember when there was all of a sudden like a wave of
*  White female comedians in the middle of Black Lives Matter going like oh wait
*  We're victims of being treated badly by male comics it was just like we don't want to post about Black Lives Matter anymore
*  It's embarrassing. It's making us uncomfortable
*  We're the victims again, so so I
*  one girl had written something where she was like I
*  You know and I have to have male comics walk me to my car at the end of the night
*  It's like okay wait, so they're nice enough to walk to you're saying the night
*  It's not comedy that's dangerous the nighttime is darkness is dangerous clubs night clubs of people
*  But I mean I I would
*  Want to be a woman I would not want to be someone who won't someone wants to fuck all time
*  And you're walking by like a personality like us
*  No
*  Think it's harder. I think it's harder. I mean there's some aspects of being a man
*  I'm sure that are probably more difficult, but I think overall the physical vulnerability part is huge
*  Yeah, it's definitely huge in a confidence business right because the thing about stand-up is a lot of it. It's a confidence
*  Yeah, well I definitely started
*  Wanting to become a weapon like I was like when I started doing to Jits and stuff
*  I was like this is how it's supposed to be like and I remember during the me to movement and stuff
*  I was always like there's something missing here where it's like a conversation with young girls about
*  Like learning to be to stand up for yourselves and be strong
*  And it's not victim you would get called victim shaming and it's like no it's about you have no control over the outside world
*  So it's protect yourself as much as you can when I was a blackout drunk
*  I was literally I was my own bodyguard leaving to go to the bathroom for fucking
*  Six hours and my body's just there
*  It's like you need like to me
*  It's like becoming the strongest I can be whether I'm a woman or a man and being able to cuz tape
*  Years ago was like if I was a woman I'd want to be the strongest woman in the world
*  I was like Tate. I just want to be hot
*  But now I get it I got to that age where I went oh, yeah
*  Like I want to be able to fuck people up if they come at me and also I think it's like just getting your intuition
*  On point you know it's like that Gavin De Becker book that gift of fear
*  I read that and it changed my life because it was like I think when you're told for so long
*  I think the the part that gets tricky is that insidious like people telling you you're crazy your psycho you're too emotional
*  You're too sensitive like calm down relax hearing that for so long my programming was the most fucked up thing because when I did actually feel
*  Someone being dangerous. I would override my intuition. I'm just being dramatic. I'm just being crazy
*  I want to accuse this person of something I got in trouble in that book
*  He talks about all the women that he interviewed that had either been attacked or assaulted
*  They always said I knew something was fucking off about that guy
*  They knew it even though he was helping them with their groceries or opening the door for them
*  They were like I felt my body knew there were some off about that guy
*  I think there's something really dangerous about not about having a very limited amount of experience with crazy people
*  Dangerous people because you don't know real violent people are real dangerous people
*  Yeah, I've been around them
*  And so you don't know that you could just run into them you could take a wrong turn on
*  Fourth Street and also there's a violent crazy person and you don't know what they're like you don't know to get away
*  You want to be nice like you don't like there's this instinct to be nice
*  I don't know if it's taught to us or whatever, but it's like you want you don't want to be rude to somebody
*  I don't know what I'm saying asshole
*  But it's like it doesn't like what I want like what I'm so glad I learned and what I would want to impart
*  On my nieces and even my nephews. It's like your safety and your and it doesn't even have to be physical safety your emotional safety
*  You're like what you want is the most important thing for you
*  So that's why boundaries aren't bad
*  You know it's just like set them up and like but for me like when we go through the comics or anyone who's ostensibly crazy
*  I'm usually not scared of those people the people advertising. They're crazy those are you have to worry about it's a quiet person in the corner
*  You're not hearing anything from well. Yes a lot of times. It's guys friends right there's a guy who's cool
*  But then he's got a friend who's fucked up, and he doesn't know his friends fucked up
*  Yeah, and you know and you're around this person all the time
*  they're slowly getting closer and closer to you and look it's
*  And can be fucking really scary
*  There's a lot of men that are scary human beings and capable of violence
*  The real skill like we hear about someone's murdering somebody knew that person who murdered somebody that's a tricky feeling
*  He like what but that's why building up your own
*  Shit is so important because you can't control a crazy person outside of you so like all these things where it's like men need to stop
*  It's like yes, of course, but also how do we protect ourselves? How do we it's not men though?
*  It's those men those particular people that are doing these awful things to people
*  Yeah, the particular murderers are rapists or thieves
*  It's it's like we have a real problem with lumping people in the group
*  I'm really are so disconnected from our intuition because I'll have it sometimes like a woman will come up to me in a meet-and-greet
*  I'm like I have a weird feeling about this person. I can't tell you why I can't articulate it
*  I know instance will be the person seems really nice. I have a weird feeling about this
*  I need this person to to go you know whereas other people are grabbing me and shaking me and I feel fine
*  This person like just being able to like never fucking know you never know
*  We can't look at each other as groups because we're gonna have my spots
*  You can have these believe all women blind spots or believe all men blind spots. Those are bad
*  Yeah, they're bad and some people just fix on you fix it on you get obsessed through social media
*  There was a girl that was like a runner-up on American Idol. She was doing a meet-and-greet and someone just walked up and shot her
*  So yeah, yeah thought they knew her I had someone
*  Yeah, I had a security issue with someone who thought they were emailing with me for four months
*  They thought we had a relationship, you know, and when you're in that kind of
*  Everything you're posting on social media feeds into their idea that you're connected they think you're talking to them
*  Schizophrenics out there. Yeah, there's a lot of really sick people out there 1% of people in this country are schizophrenic
*  Yeah, I think that's the right number. See if that's right number. I mean is what percentage of people would you guess?
*  What percentage of people are schizophrenic? I mean, it's sort of like no stat
*  These are kind of people that are like going out of their way to get evaluated
*  Yeah, well, yeah, right. There's probably more than yeah, I was gonna say
*  It's probably gonna be a little bit more than whatever it would be. What would you think it would be?
*  2%
*  You should so much of this talking about you. This has been a long intervention this whole fucking show
*  Are you talking to me or are you talking to me?
*  So much of this shit is so under diagnosed though, right 1% 2%
*  Estimated 1.1% and these are just the people that have gone in for medical attention
*  God knows the ones running around gone untreated and I needed
*  Percent they roughly estimate they add in 40% just the lineup at the Comedy Store
*  Percent but I gotta tell you I have bought a lot of shirts from Boone. I will say that I
*  Buy so many shirts. It's been around I was so happy to see that he wasn't because I was you get scared about people like that
*  Older weirdos where you live with nothing to lose. Yeah, your like job is to hand people shirts where I don't even know where you got them from
*  but
*  So
*  Lee market I was like my one of my crazies is still here. Listen kids was wrap this up. We're more than three hours
*  You guys agree right you should do a show together it's you guys have epic chemistry it would be the best show
*  And it's so unfair to chicks shows are so hot right now
*  You saying that right now like we're too too country chicks
*  But also have problem. You have to be my Jamie though
*  How often is it that you see female comics getting along publicly and supporting each other
*  I have like my girl let that this thing when they make it like this Oprah on every woman shit
*  It's like no no, no, I'm not friends with all female comics just because we're automatically female comments
*  I have little Esther. I talked to every day. I talked to you all the fucking time Bonnie McFarlane
*  They're so funny and they're so it's just so fun and we don't feel competitive
*  I mean, there's a lot of like hitting each other against each other and competitive shit. That's just like
*  Yeah, don't you think what we're talking about the comic store the other night really does hold true that this is the least competitive era of any
*  Comedy and the most supportive
*  Entrepreneurs right but we we support each other because the internet because there's not limited amount of slots
*  Like this is the thing that we were talking about with Jay Leno like back in his day
*  There was only one host of the tonight show and everybody wanted that spot when Johnny Carson left
*  There's a lot of people that wanted that spot
*  There was one and there was another then it went back to that one
*  And there's also you've shown us that helping other comics helps you
*  Plenty of pieces of pie, you know
*  Papa we love you guys you're so it's like you should be such a piece of shit
*  I think we should say really quick
*  like I do think it's important to say like as you we go into this like next chapter of like Joe Rogan that a lot of
*  People I think I think a lot of people assume that like if someone's on your podcast
*  That means they're famous like you've had a lot of commit you have made a lot of comedians lives by having them come on this
*  It's gonna make me cry I'm happy to do it you probably saved people's lives letting them come on this podcast
*  I moved out of my car Annie would be dead
*  She would be second and I moved out of my car
*  They came to represent she'd be fucking some guy in a wheelchair down in Venice
*  But I mean truly I think a lot of people don't necessarily understand because it's got so many millions of views that like a lot of comics
*  You've haven't had on here like truly homeless and he's by the way. He's uncomfortable with this which is because you're cool
*  You have you have truly given people careers you have given people their lives their sanity they're following
*  I mean, it's really a big deal. It's a big deal. It just made sense
*  It didn't it didn't seem like sent anything I ever had to think about I just wanted to help and I knew I could help
*  So I just take funny people and put them on and you still do it. I still do I just did Ali was on last week
*  Oh my god, I love she was awesome. So now everybody knows how funny she is
*  Yeah, that's what we're all supposed to do like we used to wait for a tonight show
*  Or we would wait for an HBO special. That's what we used to wait for
*  We don't have to do that anymore
*  We help each other and it helps me too because then people trust me more like oh he knows funny people
*  Like these people he gets on or funny like like so they know like I'm not trying to give you a bad show
*  Yeah, someone honest cuz they're cool
*  Famous and successful and stop hanging out with other comedians or stop helping right we see it a lot
*  Yeah, because everybody gets this is what it is because I'll tell you because I felt it myself
*  But I just
*  Realized what it was and I stopped the think the thought process you get scared
*  Yeah, because you have so much you're like, oh my god, it's so much everything so much like I just I want to keep this going
*  In yeah, keep this keep this gravy train rolling. I'm gonna stop. I'm just stop saying fucked up things
*  Maybe stop doing podcasts of comics just concentrate on scientists
*  You could think you could really start thinking like that and I know people that have done it and a lot of famous
*  Comedians they get to a certain point. They don't want to take any chances anymore
*  So they don't take chances with their material
*  Things that got them to the dance now they're avoiding now they want to like play it
*  A little bit. This is not good for you. And I saw it though. I felt it
*  I felt it as the podcast started ramping up more
*  But you just gotta do it. You just gotta keep doing it
*  But the way to do it is you get high you get drunk. Sometimes you talk shit you have fun snort some K
*  You talk to you know
*  really interesting people that are authors and
*  Adventurers and like yeah, you just do what you did
*  That's so that's all I'm doing but to be able to help comics is probably the best part of it for me
*  It's really I love I love watching it happen. I love watching people just have a career
*  You know because I know they can like yeah
*  With all of us that are good you get to a certain point you're making people laugh and you're good if you're dedicated to it
*  You can have a career. You just need to somehow or another be
*  Like not not even mentor just someone opens the door for you. Yeah, so it says come on in the show everybody
*  You also pioneered a sort of career and an art form that a lot of people wouldn't have
*  Known to do that have given them their livelihood a lot of comedians who weren't gonna get that five-minute spot on the tonight show
*  A lot of those comedians who weren't gonna get that sitcom like you paved a new route
*  but also what if you didn't have a podcast and then
*  none of us had podcasts and then this fucking quarantine happened we would just be like
*  Waiting for auditions or so girl called me up. He's like, thank god you talked me into doing a podcast
*  To
*  In the car right after you're truly feeding people's kids. Yeah, it's everybody who's a comic you're feeding my eggs
*  If you have the ability to do a podcast
*  Why wouldn't you why wouldn't you like let people know like more about how you think and yeah about what you're interested in?
*  It's so interesting cuz my podcast is only like I have like 30 something episodes and it's you know
*  Sometimes I interview and sometimes I don't but there's people it's all been called any letter. It's called mean
*  Inspiration you're very shy and you don't want to promote your stuff. I'm not aggressive
*  No, but I want to start doing more like there's these
*  People who's like they have therapy podcasts and stuff and these different types of people that I would love to interview like I want
*  To do more like the people that I love rather than just comedians or whatever
*  I have a podcast too, but I'm pretty successful. So
*  I
*  Guess is called pop pop pop
*  Good for you, but Annie needs it more. So give it to her
*  I have to pee so bad. Okay, let's wrap this up. Everybody. I love you. I love you, too
*  Thanks for doing this. I'm glad you guys are gonna do this podcast. I'm gonna be good
*  I'm gonna wait. Goodbye everybody. Bye
*  You
