# Joe Rogan Experience #2216 - Luke Bryan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdBH9pYnRUY)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Hey, what's up Luke?
*  Good. This has been, thank, this has been a long time in the making.
*  Well, I need to thank you for taking care of my family.
*  When they came to see your show.
*  I hope they had a great time.
*  They had a fucking fantastic time.
*  But it was also, my daughter was like freaked out because she was going to the show.
*  She didn't know she was going to get to meet you.
*  And her friend didn't know they were going to get to meet you either.
*  So we were able to keep that a good little secret to them.
*  Yeah, it was cool. They had the best time.
*  They came back beaming. So thank you.
*  Well Vegas, you know, that was wrapping up Vegas.
*  So yeah, we, that was a fun two years of residency there.
*  Did you do two years there?
*  I did, yeah, I did two years, 26 shows per year.
*  Dude, man, like.
*  Vegas will take a little piece of your soul.
*  Well here.
*  Just a little tiny piece every day.
*  Well the thing about it is like all of that get to Vegas and like, you know,
*  you run to the craps table or blackjack table your whole life getting to Vegas.
*  Dude, I got all that. I could, I'm like, I get to Vegas.
*  I'm like, man, let's just sit in the room, watch little sports.
*  And I got, got the gambling out of the system.
*  Well, that's good. Did you, did you just gamble a lot?
*  You know, I've always been, I've never been a sports gambler.
*  My dad, my, but my dad raised me to kind of be a poker player kind of kid.
*  He was a, like a, I mean, I used to joke.
*  If my dad didn't play poker, we'd have never had Santa Claus.
*  You know, he, I mean, he was, I mean, he was just a crazy little poker player
*  and like a little pool hustler.
*  And then, and then.
*  Oh, so he was all in.
*  Well, so one of my dad's, one of my dad's famous quotes is,
*  so we, we, we, he flies me out to Vegas when I'm 21 or whatever.
*  And man, I had like, we were in college and I had took like three, three or four
*  hundred bucks with me, you know, just broke his shit.
*  And two hours into the trip, lose my money.
*  And this was like, well, where we were still had truck phones, you know, I'm not even
*  sure we were like toting.
*  We certainly didn't have like the Motorola razor where he could just call me.
*  So he just goes looking for me and he calls my hotel room and I'm, he's like, boy,
*  what you doing?
*  He's real Georgia, real Southern Georgia.
*  I said, I lost all my damn money and hell with this place.
*  He goes, well, you ain't going to win it back in the goddamn room.
*  So, I mean, once you have that, that mindset, that mindset in gambling, certainly.
*  I mean, when that's your dad going.
*  And so that's been a famous saying when my buddies, you know, when they're down and out
*  down two or three grand and they're pouting over the bar, you know, you're not going
*  to win it back at the goddamn bar.
*  But I did.
*  I went through phases where, you know, I never really got financially behind when I
*  didn't have money.
*  I would just, I controlled it pretty well.
*  And I did my two years out there.
*  I never really had any big beats or anything like that.
*  But I do love to just, man, I love to just sit there, have a drink, have a cigar and
*  watch Dyson cards because you're just sitting there and your mind's checked out.
*  Right.
*  It's like no different than, you know, going to the driving range and hitting golf balls
*  or sitting on the bank fishing or sitting in a deer stand.
*  Right.
*  But I got out of there.
*  I got all my gambling, at least for now, out of my system.
*  But it was great to meet your kids there.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  They really enjoyed it.
*  And like I said, they were just, they were blown away meeting you.
*  Well, it was a fun show because we got to really do a lot of bells and whistles out
*  there that aren't available on normal shows when you're, you know, out touring and stuff
*  because you're having to take down stuff, be real mobile out there.
*  We put a lot of stuff in the room.
*  That's nice.
*  That's one good thing about the residency.
*  You know, you're going back to the same spot over and over again.
*  And we had our routine.
*  I mean, I have my room and, you know, about 630, I'd hop the shower, run down there and
*  get on stage about 830 and knock it out.
*  And 1030, somewhere at a craps table.
*  I'm lucky I don't gamble.
*  I don't do it.
*  You never got into sports?
*  Nope.
*  Nope.
*  I used to bet on fights back in the early days of the UFC.
*  I used to bet on fights and they, one day they made it illegal, but I already stopped doing it
*  because I was like, this is probably not a good thing for me to be betting on things I'm commentating on.
*  Because I can't affect the outcome.
*  Right.
*  But it's still quite close.
*  I also sometimes know some shit.
*  You know, this has been a bunch of times.
*  So one of my business partners, I would just, I would tell him what to bet on.
*  And we were at like 84% at one time.
*  It was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  For like six or seven fights in a row, six or seven fight cards in a row, we were at about 84%.
*  Because every now and then they would have these guys that were coming in from Japan or from Russia.
*  And the odds makers didn't know who these guys were.
*  And I was like, Oh Jesus Christ.
*  Bet the house.
*  You already were studying them for years.
*  So I knew everything about these guys.
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, bet the fucking house.
*  Lay up.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a few, like when Anderson Silva came into the UFC, I was like, bet the house, bet the house on the Brazilian.
*  Whatever you got, I go throw it all at this guy.
*  You can't fucking lose.
*  Cause when he came into the UFC, he was like in his prime and I got to see him evolve in Japan and then later on in England.
*  And so when he came in the UFC, I think he was a favorite over this guy.
*  Chris Liebman is a really tough guy, but I'm like, whatever the, whatever the odds are fucking throw it all at that guy.
*  I bet y'all were you, were you betting with them too?
*  I already stopped.
*  It was like, I can get in trouble.
*  Don't get in any trouble now either.
*  Don't lose the gig.
*  Well, now, now the UFC made a law and it was real recent, like two years ago, up until like two years ago, all staff, anyone could bet.
*  Now no one can bet.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. Cause there was a scandal.
*  One of the trainers apparently was involved, allegedly was involved, knew about an injury.
*  And then it turned out there's probably some other bets or a little shady that perhaps allegedly people were involved with.
*  So they're like, okay, we've got to put a stop to this, which is too bad.
*  Cause it was fucking nice to know.
*  If I was unscrupulous.

*  I had a little, so I went my whole life, no sports betting.
*  Through college, I mean, my, through college, I'd walk in and my buddies back then, they spliced 78 TVs together and they got all their notes.
*  And I'm like, and I'm like, dude, no wonder you're fucking, you got all D's and you're about to get shipped out of college.
*  But I survived all that.
*  And me and a buddy, we started picking two games a week and we would load up.
*  And this was, this was like six years ago, five years ago.
*  So I would load up like 20 grand a game.
*  And, but I was strict and I, and I had my deal and it just, we like bet.
*  I mean, just take Alabama and the points in the first half.
*  You do that most of the year.
*  I mean, it was 80%.
*  So we did well.
*  And then my buddy moved away from me and we quit talking about it.
*  And I just, then I went rogue for like two years.
*  I was betting like Utah State.
*  You know, the West Coast game midnight, just throwing bets in.
*  And I was like, man, I'm out.
*  So I stopped.
*  Did you see Uncut Gems?
*  Yes.
*  Dude, that movie tripped me out.
*  I think it tripped everybody out there.
*  What a great movie.
*  Especially if you've dipped your toe into that world of like, but now, and I've got buddies that do party games.
*  And like, I'm not even sure I even understand the inner workings of parlay's now.
*  I still, I mean, and teasers and all that.
*  And, you know, I'm so removed from that level of sport.
*  Like, you know, so and so is doing four late going to get four layups at the half.
*  And man, that that'll that's that's opening up Pandora's box there.
*  It is.
*  And you got to think there's people that are involved.
*  Like there's been scandals.
*  Referees were involved.
*  Referees are making calls they shouldn't have made.
*  Maybe calling fouls they shouldn't have called.
*  And people getting paid.
*  There's so much money being thrown around.
*  And, you know, the average referee, what do they make?
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, dude.
*  So I saw you at the I'm a giant Georgia fan.
*  And I saw you obviously on the sideline on Saturday and just man, some of those calls.
*  Yeah, it started getting weird.
*  We actually left after the first quarter and went to see Eminem.
*  So we had an epic day.
*  We saw first quarter of UT Georgia and then jetted and went to Eminem at the racetrack.
*  The Formula One.
*  Yeah. Eminem played in front of like one hundred and fifty thousand people.
*  It was fucking wild.
*  I mean, what a weekend for Austin, too.
*  I mean, because I had buddies.
*  I had buddies that were like, why are you not coming?
*  And I'm like, man, I've had to be me all year.
*  And it's like the weather's chilly in Nashville.
*  My boys want to go deer hunting.
*  I'm going to take them deer hunting, sit on my back patio and scream at the TV.
*  And but you got a little dicey there on the back.
*  I was like, oh, it was weird.
*  Yeah. Well, just the energy.
*  There's so much so much anticipation for a game like that.
*  But you can't replicate it.
*  You can't replicate it in any other in any other.
*  I guess those big global Brazil versus Argentina or whatever.
*  We had some friends from England who had never been to an American football game.
*  What was their take on it? They were blown away.
*  They're like, oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
*  This is madness. Like this is Texas football.
*  It's so fun. They get serious here.
*  It's crazy. I got to shoot the cannon. Boom.
*  Did you shoot it through the Georgia shirt? Yeah.
*  That one. Yeah. Oh, gosh.
*  Maybe I gave you bad luck. It hurt my heart.
*  Maybe it was bad luck because they lost.
*  Maybe what? Maybe it's a fucking rude thing to do.
*  We. Yeah, man, it was it was a it was a good win for Georgia.
*  And like I said, both those programs are just so incredible.
*  Incredible. It's when you're watching it behind the scenes, you know,
*  watching how much organization there is.
*  And it's incredibly complex through the years.
*  Kirby and I have gotten to be pretty good buddies.
*  Kirby can't be buddies with anybody because that job requires.
*  I've never seen a requirement of a job more than being a college.
*  It's probably like being a president. It is.
*  And so I don't text Kirby during the season, really.
*  I know he and man, just watching what those guys go through,
*  trying to manage these big programs like that.
*  I mean, and when they're not coaching, I mean, dude, they are politicking.
*  Yeah. I mean, they got to go to the steak supper for this for this touchdown
*  club here. You know, so, man, it is it's a wild ride.
*  What those dudes go through.
*  When you think about gambling with calls like bad calls, that has got to be
*  imagine all your money's on the line and you see some horrendous call and
*  you fucking see I'm out of that.
*  And I didn't really get into that heavily, even when I was betting regular
*  games. But man, it's it's it's freedom, man.
*  I just watch the games with freedom and I don't I don't get in.
*  You know, I'm good friends with Dana White and Dana's a he's a real
*  degenerate like a heart.
*  How big that's the best way to describe.
*  Oh, he'll describe it that way.
*  Like most they most like your big horse racing guys, they all their
*  adjective of themselves is I'm a degenerate.
*  That's the first thing that's Jamie and I.
*  Jamie and I went to visit.
*  We went with Shane Gillis and a bunch of other guys went to visit Dana while
*  he's gambling. When we got there, he was down six hundred thousand dollars.
*  And I was like, what is happening?
*  I heard him say he learned how to play backgap because you can bet more like you
*  can bet like five hundred carat or something like that.
*  That's so crazy.
*  I could I was getting anxiety just sitting there watching.
*  And so then Taylor, the wand came over and Dana and Taylor have this deal
*  where Dana teaches Taylor what to gamble and how to do it.
*  They're down one hundred and twenty thousand dollars and what five minutes,
*  five minutes, five minutes or down one hundred twenty grand.
*  And I'm just sitting there going, what the fuck, man?
*  Look, Dana is rich as shit.
*  Obviously, I know Taylor is wealthy, but there's like a level where you could
*  lose one hundred twenty five thousand dollars is one hundred twenty five thousand dollars.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I've learned kind of like if you're betting a thousand a hand,
*  you can get down 50. Yeah.
*  Like in quick.
*  But when you transition to that.
*  Thirty, forty, fifty thousand a hand, you'll be down a million or a million or two.
*  And I say because I've watched some other buddies that bet on that level.
*  I'm talking about like 15 hand swing is a eight hundred thousand dollar swing.
*  And I'm like, but that's the scary part about gambling when you start when you don't have
*  much money and you grow into some money.
*  But your your level of what you want to press your your anxiety level and your endorphins and all that.
*  It grows with your your wealth.
*  And then next thing you know, you're.
*  But that's the only way they get their fixed. Right.
*  They can't play twenty dollars a hand. Yeah, right.
*  That goes away. Right. It's like. Right.
*  Well, it's like the whole you know, it's there's a lot in society that, you know,
*  I think we're preyed upon with those with that thought process gambling and a lot of dopamine hits.
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then once one level of the dopamine levels out, then you go to the next one.
*  Yeah, it's hard to watch. Forget about doing it.
*  It's hard to watch. Like, I don't I don't get it.
*  I'm glad I can say that I've always have fun with it.
*  I mean, I've always had fun gambling.
*  And a lot of times I take my band after we get off stage and we'd have one band night.
*  And I'd like set them all up with some chips.
*  And and I've gotten at a crap table where I can kind of manage everybody's bets.
*  And I'm like, don't do that now. Wait, wait.
*  And it's kind of like the, you know, steering the mothership.
*  And we had some great nights, you know, just laughing and cutting up and, you know, cheering, you know,
*  you know, like I said, one guy walks up and everybody rubs his head for good.
*  You know, it's just it's just comradery, you know, at the craps table.
*  I gambled so much at the craps table my last night.
*  They let my craps team that dealt me all the craps come on stage and we celebrated.
*  I'm out there like I play in and I look at my you know, because they work in teams, you know, they are.
*  And my team comes out on stage and dude, I was roaring laughing.
*  I'm like, yeah, so that's hilarious.
*  Look, I know people have a problem with gambling.
*  I think it should be legal, but it can get away from you.
*  Yeah, well, but that's like a lot of things in this world.
*  Alcohol. There's a lot of things that get away from you.
*  Yeah, doesn't mean it should be illegal.
*  Right. Well, Lord, it's just weird.
*  That's only legal in a few states.
*  I think that's expanding now.
*  And then I remember when online gambling was illegal.
*  Oh, yeah. And then was not long ago.
*  The early days of the UFC online gambling was illegal.
*  And then mine, you know, in because we're obviously southeastern Tennessee Bible Belt.
*  And I don't know, but there's there's certain states.
*  I guess Tennessee is a legal gambling state because or maybe George.
*  I can't tell. I have to I have to talk to my nephew's all of his buddies
*  and see if they're on the little apps.
*  But man, they'll go sign their buddies up to get the two hundred dollar free break.
*  I mean, they got all kind of a racket. Yeah.
*  Well, and then also people would go to Indian reservations.
*  That was the big right. And then you got to also crazy.
*  You got to pay the legal.
*  You got to pay the Indian reservation tax. Right.
*  You know, you got to pay your 50 cent to do the dollar bet.
*  Yeah. Do that math.
*  Yeah. And you only have to be like a small percentage Native American to get a piece of that.
*  So there's a lot of millionaires just hanging around that casino, just enjoying it.
*  But if you got a place like in Connecticut, like a Mohegan and all that,
*  they're great places, you know, typically on my way kind of the Mohegan, I'd go play there a couple of years.
*  I did one night I did three nights there.
*  And, dude, I'm like getting off stage, just sitting there gambling.
*  And, you know, I'm like, am I coming out ahead on this gig or what?
*  But I think I got out there making a little money. Yeah.
*  It's weird, though, that you could do that legally.
*  Well, then even like in Tennessee and Tunica back in the day, you just put a barge on the Mississippi River and you can gamble.
*  It's like, well, what is that all about? Right.
*  That's that show Ozark. Right. Yeah.
*  Well, totally the same premise. You know, it's like put a barge on the river.
*  And now let's take all these people's money.
*  Yeah. My buddy Johnny used to he was a pool hustler.
*  He used to call people riverboat gamblers when guys would just go off.
*  And, you know, a guy was a gambling addict. He just trick them into a game.
*  He's like, guy's a riverboat gambler.
*  Or yeah, that's the two analogies, degenerate or riverboat gambler.
*  Be careful of all of them.
*  It's just always been funny to me that like Native American reservations are essentially a country inside the country and they could do whatever the fuck they want.
*  Like I was just reading about this Colorado wolf deal, you know, where they've relocated wolves to Colorado and the Native American reservation.
*  Let them know the moment those wolves get onto our land, we're flying over in helicopters and gunning them down.
*  I was I elk hunt every year in Colorado. And is that where you've done?
*  I've done Colorado. Most years I go to Utah. Yeah.
*  Well, first of all, Cam Haynes and I, you know, we've got a connection with Cam and just love that guy.
*  But yeah, we so when I saw Colorado do that, I was like, it's just like, what are we doing, guys?
*  Well, whenever you have biology that's getting voted on by people who don't understand it, it should be decided by wildlife biologists.
*  That's it. That's the only people that should decide whether or not things like that happen.
*  Well, we can really dive into this and let's do it.
*  My thing is. We are so governed in the world of wildlife biology through the states and stuff.
*  They're not going to let animals, they're not going to let humans ruin animal populations.
*  I don't think no, of course, if anything's going to happen, they're going to mess it up and let animal populations.
*  Get too big. I was I was and I don't know if I I don't know who to name or whatever, but I was with some guys with Wyoming.
*  And, you know, we're talking about grizzly bears. And I said, man, you know, because they brought up grizzly bear problems.
*  And I said, well, what what what is the deal?
*  And they said, well, there's fifteen hundred or fourteen to fifteen hundred grizzly bears in Wyoming.
*  There needs to be five to six hundred and and five of the fifteen hundred are only hunting humans.
*  Like, why have totally have totally.
*  But there's not that many human deaths.
*  Well, you bet. In Yellowstone, you if you pay attention, there's about two or three that get that get right.
*  But those five hundred grizzly bears that are just five, five, five, five, not five hundred.
*  So there's five. There's five. Right. There's five grizzly.
*  Sorry, this probably won't be the first time I am not totally clear with you.
*  But yes, so there's there's five, four to fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred.
*  There needs to be five hundred to six hundred grizzlies.
*  But of the of those five to six of the all of them, five of them have like, oh, we don't we don't care about salmon anymore.
*  We want to sit by this trail and pick off this hiker.
*  And that is that is a high up biologist in Wyoming telling me that.
*  And I'm like, well, why won't they let you all go in there, let some hunters think about the the you can do the math chart, do a thirty thousand dollar grizzly bear tag, do a twenty thousand dollar one.
*  They'll go for that. Yeah, for sure.
*  Go in and let it manage it right. But there's one federal judge that's got it all shut down.
*  One judge. That's so crazy.
*  My friend went moose hunting, said he saw no moose and he saw twelve grizzlies in Wyoming.
*  I went on a bear hunt in Alberta and there's so many grizzlies now you can't even go.
*  It was through Kam's people. John and Jen.
*  Yeah, they I saw them recently and they've had to move.
*  They move areas. Yeah, they have abandoned areas because they're overrun with grizzlies.
*  They sent me some trail camp pics that are terrifying, like little school buses, like school buses like the size of these fucking grizzlies.
*  Was it you that was talking about we were they were trying to determine a male grizzly versus a male gorilla and who would win?
*  Do we ever think I'm on team grizzly? Me too.
*  Because they eat things and kill things every day.
*  Gorillas just they they fight. They just like they puff their chest out. They mostly eat grass.
*  Well, but when you think about thirty, forty thousand dollars per grizzly and then the the guiding fee.
*  Yeah. And then the taxidermy. Yeah.
*  Think about the taxidermist. And then the Pittman Roberts.
*  People need to understand all the gear, everything. Ten percent of that goes to wildlife management. All of it.
*  And then at the end of that, nobody's going to let the grizzlies get exterminated.
*  Right. It's not it's they're overpopulated.
*  And then when you look at the population, how beautiful the elk population is in Colorado and how amazingly managed it is in Colorado for public hunters,
*  for a guy like me, they can go get an over the counter tag. I think they're probably going to wipe out over the counter tags for out of staters.
*  They're going to make it a draw tag. And then now the wolves get to eat them.
*  And I don't get to bring my elk hunting money in and give it to the right.
*  But I don't think it is they what they always say that they're going to get to a certain level of the population and then they're going to open it up for management.
*  But they don't wolf management. Yeah.
*  But what happens is people sue in the wildlife, you know, all the people that are like that love wolves.
*  They fault they sue. And when they sue, they they stop the hunt and then it has to go to court and it has to get decided.
*  And if you get a radical judge like this judge that you said that's in Wyoming, these are all things that people in the know are telling me.
*  So, Lord, I don't I don't need a judge somewhere in Wyoming like pulling my foot.
*  You're probably right. Everyone that I know that hunts there says there there's a lot of grizzly bears.
*  And it's concerning because you don't see all of them.
*  If you see a lot of them, there's a lot more than you don't see, because most of them are just not just out in the open hanging out with you.
*  Most of them are deep in the woods.
*  Well, and and so I went on a I went on a salmon trip up in British Columbia.
*  And what you do is 99 percent of your interpretation of a grizzly is this big old fat chunky thing.
*  Well, so we're flying in on these helicopters to go fish the salmon runs that are running up into the mountains of British Columbia.
*  And it's an amazing trip like you fly over in the helicopter, you look down, you see the huge schools of salmon, you take your fly rod and you go catch them and drink your beer.
*  Well, helicopter pilot was like, hey, man, we've seen some grizzlies in the area just.
*  And, you know, at the time, we're like, man, this is all part of the experience.
*  Yeah, it's like get a get us kind of going a little bit.
*  Well, we land and the night before we didn't fish that day.
*  So we flown in and drank some wine and did you know, my eyes are like fuzzy and we're fishing.
*  And I tell my guy with him, hey, I'm gonna go to the helicopter and get a beer or something.
*  And indeed, I get there and I pop my beer and I'm like, I look down the river and I'm like.
*  Fuck, that is a fucking grizzly coming toward my buddy.
*  And I went, Jay. And dude, it was slim and like a damn it was lean and like a greyhound.
*  Not I wouldn't say lean, but it hadn't it hadn't got all fat on salmon yet.
*  Well, it comes down the bank and jumps in and we ease back to the helicopter.
*  We look back here comes another grizzly literally 30 yards from us.
*  And I'm like, we get there and I'd left my beer on the bank and my grizzly sticks his tongue in my beer.
*  And then he jumps in the river. I run, grab the beer, drink.
*  I'm like, Grizzly spit anyway. The helicopter pilot goes.
*  You did not drink a beer. I had to sip of it after. I had to.
*  But that's like a trick and osis. Wild shit.
*  Yeah, I get from that some berry infection or whatever.
*  Yeah, but moose ass. So listen, dude, we get on the helicopter and the pilots like, man, they're they're getting too comfortable.
*  We take off, fly a mile down the river.
*  I'd already had my fly rod together. I never broke it down.
*  So I sat in a little basket and we land.
*  I take off about 200 yards, start fishing and I had I had I had to slide down this like 20 foot cut bank where the river cut the bank.
*  I look across the river. Here comes a grizzly bear galloping on the other side of the river.
*  And I'm like, well, I've already seen the other two mature ones.
*  And I was like, well, that's a baby grizzly. That's I was like, that's cute.
*  Dude, that grizzly hits that bank on the other side of that river and jumps about 20 feet in the air and lands in that river.
*  It looked like a Volkswagen VW bug hit that river.
*  I take off to the helicopter. All my guys are like, get here, get here.
*  A mother and two two of the babies were on my tail.
*  Oh, my God. And when I got to the helicopter, dude, ruined my whole trip.
*  I couldn't really get scared when you're on the mothers.
*  Oh, they're the ones that they fuck everybody up in two seconds.
*  They don't play any games when they have their cops with them.
*  They don't take any chances like I'm going to incapacitate this dude.
*  Yeah. Fuck him. It is.
*  So that was my that was my grizzly encounter.
*  I wish all these people that get to vote, unlike B.C.
*  when B.C. outlawed grizzly bear hunting.
*  I wish all those people that experience you should have to experience what it's actually like there.
*  You should have to see. Well, I see the population.
*  You see what it's like experiencing them.
*  These aren't teddy bears.
*  And for you saying you shouldn't be able to manage the population as wildlife biologists say it should be managed.
*  You're putting people in danger, especially people that live up there.
*  The thing about it with me now, listen, I grew up deer hunting my whole life.
*  Ducks, dove, quail.
*  And man, I always had a soft spot for bears.
*  And probably I still it's not like I got to go shoot bears every year.
*  I mean, whatever. But when you find out, when you hear you are a hunter and there are.
*  Like when I met John and Jenny and they were like, look, there are so many that are that need to be managed.
*  And I was like, man, that's cool. Let's go. Let's go do a bear hunt.
*  Had a great time and didn't, you know, didn't get all heady with killing a bear.
*  I mean, I know guys in Tennessee and Gatlinburg, Joe, I mean, they are darting black bears off second story moat holiday in balconies.
*  They're digging in. I mean, they're digging in candy, you know, vending machines.
*  And I'm like, dude, it's just a matter of time.
*  Somebody's gonna walk out their balcony and they're gonna get they're gonna get got right there.
*  One hundred percent. And they dart them and move them back into the Smoky Mountains.
*  And then you know what happened in New Jersey, right?
*  The governor ran on this policy of banning the grizzly bear hunt.
*  And he got in or excuse me, the black bear hunt in Jersey.
*  Jersey has the most black bears per capita in the country, which is crazy.
*  I'm going to send you some because I sent this to Cam last night because it's nuts.
*  This dude just shot the state record.
*  So it's back in. Yes, it's back in immediately because they had so many interactions.
*  My mother lives in Mexico Beach, Florida, on the panhandle.
*  There's a lot over there, too. And they like trash cans turned over every day.
*  Crazy amounts in South Georgia and Florida. Yeah, that's it.
*  So I have a photo of the bear, Jamie, I'm going to send it to you next to the dude who killed it.
*  That's a good one. Yeah, I'm sending this to.
*  But look at that size, that bear. So this is in New Jersey.
*  This is New Jersey. This is New Jersey. I never even seven hundred and seventy pound bear in New Jersey.
*  I never I didn't know they were they were up there that they're dense, dense with bears.
*  I have a buddy who lives out there, says he sees them all the time.
*  So down in the furthest, most southern corner of Georgia, Bainbridge, Georgia and all that.
*  And then Mexico Beach, Florida around Lake Seminole. I mean, they're everywhere.
*  They're all over the place. You get that photo of that dude laying next to it.
*  Yeah. Look at the size of that thing.
*  Now, that that article says eight hundred pounds. That's from Sever Broadheads.
*  It says 880. But the other article said 770. It looks it's big.
*  Whatever the actual size it is, it's big. Look at that sever hole.
*  Well, it's you know, like I said, I'm not that that's a perfect shot.
*  I think there's healthy numbers of all of it.
*  And like I said, when I see, you know, when you see, I don't know, wolves and elks.
*  Well, there's more than healthy numbers. OK, there are 770.
*  Oh, gutted, 770 gutted. Whoa.
*  That's what it is. So they weighed it in at 770 pounds gutted.
*  So the thing was about 880. Holy shit. Holy shit.
*  Yeah, you see, they got it in a slide. They had to put it in a well.
*  That's crazy. Man, there's so many of.
*  And for people who don't know, people eat bear and bears.
*  Yeah, it tastes well. And you know, the sad part about I think California, you know, the whole
*  the whole, you know, the gallbladder deal, I don't know much about that, but you know,
*  yeah, there was a black market for black bear gallbladder.
*  Yeah, in some some cultures, they think it's medicine.
*  And, you know, so they were killing black bears just for their gallbladder.
*  Yeah. And I don't I think that was overblown.
*  I don't think it's going to affect the population.
*  I'm guessing, especially a place like New Jersey.
*  How are you going to affect that population?
*  They're they're everywhere there.
*  You ever see the fights they have in Far Rockaway?
*  What's Far Rockaway? Far Rockaway, New Jersey is like a nice suburb.
*  It's a nice neighborhood.
*  Giant bears, Jamie, pull that video up.
*  Giant bears. Did you ever see the guy that did you ever see the guy that filmed like the 10 minute
*  grizzly fight? This might be. Oh, yes, I did. That was that was insane.
*  But that's where grizzlies are supposed to be.
*  This isn't a fucking neighborhood.
*  These are big bears and they're duking it out on this guy's nice lawn.
*  They go tumbling down the stairs and they start fighting in the street
*  and people are watching and they're probably fighting over trash cans.
*  So look at the size of these fuckers.
*  Imagine like you're watching TV.
*  So these dudes, they duke it out.
*  This is like, Jamie, how long is this video?
*  It's like a 10 minute video, six minute video.
*  So six minutes for six minutes, these dudes duke it out.
*  They pile out into the street. They're biting each other.
*  And this guy's filming from a car.
*  And you see it as it like trumbles down like, yes, pull it down.
*  So when they're in this, so they come tumbling down the hill, you know, full UFC style, duking it out,
*  passing by this guy's this guy's mailbox.
*  Look at him.
*  It goes on forever.
*  And they're out in the street.
*  This is a nice neighborhood.
*  And you have huge predators in front of a Volvo.
*  What the fuck?
*  And this guy was trying to ban the hunt.
*  Hey, pal, there's plenty of these bears.
*  You should hunt them because if you don't hunt them, they're going to hunt you.
*  Well, they're going to, you know, that's the thing.
*  I think it's no different than I mean, I grew up in South Georgia with Gators and yeah, same thing.
*  You get one comfortable with you, man.
*  And it's not good.
*  It is not good at all.
*  What's the problem?
*  What we're dealing with here is ballot biology.
*  It's all people that are very emotional.
*  Most of them live in cities.
*  Before I ever hunted bear before I ever hunted at all, I was like, kill a bear.
*  What an asshole.
*  You don't have to be an asshole to kill a bear.
*  And then you get it.
*  I was saying I was kind of same way.
*  But you probably had more hunting experience.
*  I grew up fishing.
*  Well, I had whitetail hunting.
*  And I remember a man, you know, being a 14 year old kid shooting a deer and having remorse.
*  But then you need to have that remorse too as a hunter.
*  You need to understand.
*  You're taking a life.
*  Yes.
*  And you need to.
*  And I tell my boys that.
*  My boys have grown up in it seriously.
*  I'm like, hey, man, hold up.
*  Right.
*  So you just don't run up to the run up to it, chunk it in the machine.
*  Just just do a little homage.
*  Right.
*  So go ahead.
*  But that.
*  Yeah.
*  But the remorse.
*  Go ahead.
*  The remorse is important.
*  It's a part of the experience.
*  Like you are now connected to the food that you're going to eat.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's what most people don't have.
*  And I think I think that's bad for us.
*  I think all of human existence has been wrapped around hunting animals and we
*  hunted them ourselves forever.
*  And then we eventually figured out agriculture.
*  But when we hunt, we hunted them ourselves.
*  Most of the time that humans were human and we had this deep connection to this
*  animal because this animal is going to sustain our family.
*  And they used it.
*  They took the, the, the skin from it and they made all kinds of things.
*  They took the tendons.
*  They made strings for bows.
*  The fur.
*  Yeah.
*  The fur.
*  I mean, it's what their clothes were made out of.
*  They ate all the organs.
*  They ate everything.
*  It sustained everybody.
*  And that was how people lived.
*  And then when people stopped living like that, we got a little confused.
*  I know people that eat meat.
*  Like my wife was at dinner with her friends and the, the, the, they were from England
*  and one of the friends said, where's your husband?
*  And she said, oh, he's, he's elk hunting.
*  And, and the guys made some sort of while he was eating meat, they were eating
*  made some sort of while he was cutting a steak, made some sort of like, oh, that's atrocious.
*  Why does he do that?
*  And she goes, why are you eating meat?
*  You didn't like you paid a supermarket hit man to go kill that fucking steak.
*  Listen, like this is so stupid.
*  But when you're removed from it culturally and England is basically removed from it
*  culturally, there's roe deer there and there's some stags.
*  Stag, yeah.
*  But for the most part, England has a very small hunting population.
*  And I believe bow hunting is actually outlawed there.
*  It's outlawed in a lot of places in Europe.
*  It's outlawed in Scotland.
*  It's outlawed in a lot of places.
*  So there's like a deep ignorance as to what's going on and what it is.
*  And then they have judgment based on these cultural norms of like, and there's
*  media depictions, media depictions of hunters in movies.
*  They're never the good guys.
*  They're always pieces of shit.
*  The hunters are always assholes are always drunk.
*  They're always, you know, trying to kidnap women or kill somebody.
*  Right.
*  They're always like torturing an animal.
*  There's always something where someone has to come in and fuck up the hunters
*  because hunters are they're portrayed as bad guys in movies.
*  Yeah.
*  And then and listen, you know, the success rate of the proper ethical things always
*  line up that that that you know, you don't the success rate doesn't always go
*  like you wanted it to.
*  Right.
*  And but, you know, the fact that hunters still are working every day just to
*  keep hunting and the fact that hunting is declining so bad.
*  It took a little uptick during the year because during COVID people like, hey,
*  man, this fucking well, what if there's no food?
*  My buddy lived in Asheville and he sent me a photo in the middle of the pandemic.
*  He goes, dude, he goes, there's no meat.
*  And he was going down the meat aisle.
*  He's like filming it.
*  He's like, there's no fucking meat here.
*  One of the best things that's just naturally happened at our house and my wife
*  is, you know, my wife's like typical housewife plays tennis, great shape,
*  doesn't you know, when she kind of eats like a bird when she does eat.
*  But man, she will call me and she'll go, hey, let's have Elk Night.
*  And because we keep our freezer in my garage and I've got all my tackle in there.
*  And she has through the years understood like, hey, I'm going to run out to the
*  freezer. We're going to do taco night.
*  I'm going to throw all the Elk meat in the sink, start thawing it.
*  And man, over the last five years, we I woke up and we haven't had we haven't
*  had, you know, beef, cattle and hamburger, tacos, spaghettis, bolognese.
*  We haven't eaten in five years at my house.
*  And it just it takes you a minute to go, hey, put it in the freezer and then
*  plan your plan your dinner.
*  You know, we all get busy with kids and stuff like that.
*  But I'm so proud of her that she'll call me and be like, hey, I'm going out to
*  the freezer. Do you want me to get these tenderloins?
*  Because by the time me and my I got three children that go out there with me now
*  and two or three of us will get one.
*  I mean, we got enough meat like it's awesome.
*  That's the best food.
*  It's so good for me.
*  When you pad out an elk patty hamburger like your hands have nothing on it.
*  Right.
*  Like, I mean, you could take beef patty and just like it's just like fat grease.
*  It's like talking, you know.
*  That's also why it tastes so good.
*  Right. Which we got it.
*  There's a time and place for that.
*  It's pretty cool that elk gets that.
*  And they still have to add a little bit of pork fat to elk just to keep it.
*  But I give a lot of meat away.
*  And whenever I do and I get text back, I get excited.
*  People like, damn, this is so good.
*  And it makes me feel better.
*  It does make you feel like there's something about a wild game and get energy from it.
*  Well, yeah.
*  And yeah, when you can go like we at my place, my deer place in southern Tennessee.
*  Yeah, man, we just we make sure, man, we got I got a big walk in cooler there.
*  And if we if we're not going to take something in there, I put I've got some red stag at my place in Tennessee.
*  I did a high fence down there.
*  And so between stag and whitetail and elk, you know, we're moving we're moving meat around and make jerky.
*  Are they roaring on your property?
*  They do.
*  That's the craziest sound.
*  It's the baddest.
*  I thought the elk sound was crazy.
*  Elk sounds probably the craziest.
*  It's the best.
*  I'm used to it.
*  But the roar when you hear a stag, it sounds like a lion.
*  I put one on my Instagram story, Jamie.
*  See if you can find it.
*  This dude just staring at the camera roaring.
*  I bet or I hear rather Argentina is a great place to go.
*  Yeah, I hear they have a lot of down in Argentina.
*  We it's interesting because Tennessee is very, very strict on their whitetail.
*  Here he is. Listen to this guy.
*  Imagine if you were some dude and it's like a thousand years ago and you don't know what the fuck that is.
*  So my 14 year old has been going to Colorado with me for a year and a half.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to go to Colorado.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to go to Colorado.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to go to Colorado.
*  And I'm like, I'm going to go to Colorado.
*  So my 14 year old has been going to Colorado with me since he was five or six.
*  And when they're that little, obviously they can't bow hunt, but we would get an elk down and I'd let the boys hike up with me and pack the elk out.
*  And one day we had another hunter with us going to get an elk.
*  And my two little ones were following me.
*  And I said, well, we had an elk bugle.
*  I said, hey, boys, stay right here.
*  And they're six, six and eight.
*  And we went up the hill and I could keep, well, Tate right before I walked off, he goes, Dad, are they going to kill us if we sit here?
*  Because those elk bugles, I mean, you can feel their bugles in the woods.
*  And I said, no, son.
*  You can feel them in your chest.
*  So we went up and tried to call this elk in.
*  And then some elk did actually cross in front of them.
*  And they're six and eight, just sitting there, this big herd of elk coming by.
*  And we come back and I was watching.
*  I could see them sitting down there on this this tall log that I put them on.
*  And I got back and they were like, those elk were all, you know, having your boys.
*  I mean, that's that's what I live for.
*  And to keep the you know, and I just wish we could create a narrative where getting your children doing that will.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  Well, hunting is a very difficult entry.
*  It's very difficult.
*  It's very difficult. If you're a person who's like listening to this, like I've never hunted before, but I'd like to learn how to do it.
*  Good luck. It's very hard.
*  You're right. Very, very hard.
*  It's very hard to find someone who's going to teach you, who has the patience to show you what to do.
*  You've never shot a rifle before.
*  It's very hard to understand.
*  Like, what is the difference between a 300 win mag and a seven millimeter?
*  Yeah, it is.
*  That that's the that is the tricky part, really, with all outdoors.
*  If you could if you could bridge the gap between all parts of urban life and allow urban life to to find a place to go.
*  But the when we went through a phase in outdoors where landowners were like, if you hunt my land and you twist your ankle and break your leg, you're going to sue me.
*  So, no, you're not allowed to come hunt my land.
*  So all the deer get overpopulated, eat all my crops.
*  And then so I think now states I think Tennessee has put a law into where some of those getting sued.
*  Well, what I'm what I'm saying is that feeds people's inability to go find somewhere to hunt, too.
*  I mean, you're so many people don't have a 50 acre farm.
*  They can't afford it, but they want to go hunt.
*  And then I just hope the hunting community and even the whole outdoor community can make it more accessible and landowners.
*  I mean, I had this little lady that that I wanted a turkey hunt.
*  She had 60 acres at bordered like a 300 acre track of mine.
*  I was like, ma'am, when when I'm out hunting and some of my turkeys or our turkeys may cross onto your property, do you mind if I go in her house is a mile away from or it's 50 acres.
*  It's probably 400 yards. She thought my shotgun was going to shoot through her house and kill her.
*  And I had to spend 45 minutes and she grew up in Tennessee in the country.
*  Right. And she doesn't understand that a shotgun is not, you know.
*  And so, man, the education of it all, just the bridge and the knowledge of it gradually gets worse and worse.
*  Right. But the need for it gets greater and greater.
*  And I tell my children all the time, I'm like, boys, there is no drug in the world.
*  And I'm not a, you know, I'm pretty straight guy.
*  I've never done done much of that. But I said, I got a lot of crazy buddies that have.
*  And when a big elk's walking in or a big whitetail or you hook a big fish there, that the adrenaline from that no drug will replace it.
*  Nothing's like it. I've done some wild.
*  I've seen the documentation of the wild stuff.
*  I've done some wild shit. I'm going to send you a video, Jamie, of something that happened last week.
*  So this is this is the best example that this is the best example that we had this elk and he was out at about 50 yards.
*  We'd snuck in on him. He was over the ridge at 50 yards.
*  We could see the tips of his antlers moving around. I had my sights set at 50 yards.
*  And as my friend was calling him, my friend was at a tree that was about 20 yards from me.
*  He came right into our lap. So it's one of those things.
*  I had arranged a 50 and then I see him coming in. He's coming in.
*  I dial my range again at 40 a diamond.
*  Oh, she's coming into our lap. He just kept coming in.
*  Watch this video. Do you know how many?
*  God damn modern technology.
*  It didn't make it through. Oh, it's still going.
*  Hold on. Pressing it to send it through. I message.
*  Oh, is that what it is?
*  OK, let me say it went through. Did you go through? OK.
*  Bust out those cars. You want a little heavier or a mile?
*  Whenever you have. Here goes. Check this out.
*  Oh, listen to this. Listen is when he comes over the hill and gets angry.
*  Like when I heard that, I was like, oh, here he comes.
*  So right now he's about 50 yards. What's your heart doing right now?
*  Right now, I'm pretty calm because he's 50 yards. Right.
*  But now I'm realizing he's not going to stop. So I arranged him again.
*  Now he's at 40. He pauses for a second. He's staring at me.
*  I have to stop. Oh, yes. So you're off to the right.
*  I'm off to the right and I'm pressed up against a tree.
*  Full camo hiding in plain sight. So now he's moving out.
*  So now I'm like, oh, shit, I'm moving my site to 20.
*  So now I move my site to 20 and I'm trying to figure out a time to draw.
*  So right here I draw. That's when he turns. Oh, he needs some movement.
*  This is another one. Beautiful one. Perfect. That was it.
*  Boom. It's that and there's so much nerves and so much like anxiety
*  and you're ranging them and he's coming in and it's like, and you think he's going to be a 50,
*  but also he's at 20. And then it's like, don't punch the shot.
*  Like relax, execute a perfect shot. Well, here's the beauty of all that in the outdoors.
*  You know, when you hear these are mild, they're good though.
*  Man, when you when you when you kind of conquer one level of fishing or hunting,
*  then there's another one you can go learn the space in.
*  You know what I'm saying? You can go. Right.
*  And what I say is like I just I mean from the elk hunter that I was
*  the elk hunter that I was 10 years ago, like took so much,
*  took so much work to even get from a 10 percent knowledgeable elk hunter to a 60 percent.
*  Now, like I can watch that elk react to everything and know what that else,
*  how that else reacting because I've done it for 11, 12 years now.
*  And I've got I've taken my boys. Well, so when you get tired of whitetail hunting
*  and whitetail hunting gets rudimentary, then go try to dig in and take it to the next level to challenge yourself.
*  That's what's so fun about like when I got I was always a bass fisherman.
*  Always a bass fisherman. Never fly fisherman.
*  Well, then I got into fly fisherman and that became the new seven year challenge that I tie your own flies.
*  I can now the little I can tie big streamers. Right.
*  But like the little bitty. You got to get like goggles on.
*  Oh, yeah. It's a real art form.
*  Totally the one of the most rewarding things you can do.
*  Sure. You make your own make your own fly and trick a big ass fish, a big fish with it.
*  And my only problem with fly fishing is a lot of his catch and release.
*  And I'm like, it's fun. I know it's fun, but you're basically just fucking with fish.
*  You just fucking with them like I could have killed you, bitch.
*  You know, well, I get it.
*  I get it. I get the handling of the trout like when I was, you know, I grew up bass fishing and we're like the bass flies out of the water.
*  We grab it and, you know, as kids, we're like, oh, you know, you catch a trout and it's like a it's like a creature.
*  Yeah, it's like a team in the in the delivery room comes in to hold the brand new baby or what?
*  Heck, they treat newborns.
*  They're slapping newborns around and getting their lungs going before, you know, you mishandle a trout.
*  But, you know, the whole mystique of trout and all of this stuff is just, man, it's outlets for all of us.
*  You know, I mean, I remember when I moved to Nashville, man, my dad, he kept me fishing and hunting.
*  And he wound up being a pretty dang successful business guy.
*  And he all he told me he goes, dude, when you move to Nashville, don't forget to take time to go do that stuff.
*  And, you know, for about two or three years, man, I did and I was focusing on my career.
*  But now as I roll out, you know, as I'm kind of established, you know, man, it's it's been the highlight.
*  And the fact that three boys landed in my life, like, you know, my wife's like, it's not even fair that you have because I can always use one of them.
*  I was like, well, baby, bow, you know, he's really been stressed at school and he wants to hunt this evening.
*  She's like, I know your game. I know your game.
*  But well, we're so lucky in this country, too, that there's so much places that are public land.
*  That's another thing that Europe doesn't have. I mean, that's what Robin Hood was all about.
*  People think Robin Hood was steal from the rich and give to the poor.
*  No, it was about hunting lands and hunting rights.
*  People were starving and the king had all the land and there was all these deer.
*  And Robin Hood would go out and whack deer like that was the story about Robin Hood.
*  It really wasn't about stealing money. It was really about hunting rights.
*  Right. They don't have that. I didn't know that.
*  Yeah. That's what's why it's so fucked over there.
*  That's why they don't have this attitude. And that's why that's why, you know, you hope the whole education of hunting and landowners and conservation of the animals and all the land ties into where, you know, landowners need to have a better life.
*  And I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  I think that's the problem.
*  It's so sensational to know that that meat is going to go to waste.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Man, I don't know.
*  You know, I guess enough whiskey and a whole back road and a rifle, you'll...
*  Shitty education, bad childhood, all the above.
*  Well, but...
*  Yeah, all the above.
*  But yeah, I mean, I look at...
*  I've got Till, my nephew, he's lived with me since he was 12.
*  Till's 22 now, and Bo is...
*  Bo's 16 and Tate is 14.
*  And Till was 15 when he killed his first elk.
*  The rule has been if you can pull 55 pounds, you're ready to hunt.
*  And so Bo is a lot bigger than Tate.
*  When he was 13 and 14, so Bo, my 13-year-old, killed a full-grown elk at 13.
*  Whoa.
*  With a Bo?
*  With a Bo.
*  Totally the frigging most badass thing I've ever seen.
*  And then...
*  Just to be that young and be able to execute the shot.
*  Dude, he did it and he earned it.
*  And like I said, I've been hiking them up those hills.
*  That's what another...
*  Like, the hunting and the killing is...
*  Man, when you pack out a damn 800-pound animal, the first time I packed my elk out,
*  dude, when I got to the Polaris, I mean, I was like...
*  I was sobbing like from...
*  Exertion.
*  Exertion.
*  Like delusional because we took a wrong turn.
*  We hit a big aspen blowdown.
*  And I had to tote the head and the cape out, and I had to walk over blown-down aspen with that cape.
*  And once we got 500 yards into the blowdown,
*  Man, we got that bug in all the elk hunting guides.
*  They're the toughest dudes.
*  Oh yeah, they're doing that all year long.
*  They're grizzled.
*  They're the toughest guys.
*  I tell people, man, if I get called in in a serious war, I'm calling my elk guides.
*  That's my first call.
*  But it's...
*  And I didn't grow up ever thinking I'd have the opportunity or the ability to go hunt elk.
*  But once you start doing it...
*  But man, this week I killed...
*  Thursday I killed my biggest whitetail I ever did.
*  And man, I was so...
*  I'm so overwhelmed by killing it.
*  I don't even know if I've enjoyed it yet because it kind of happened fast.
*  But it's just so fun.
*  You got a picture?
*  How big is it?
*  It was big.
*  So listen, now...
*  And so I didn't post it because it's obviously in my high fence.
*  And you know the...
*  You know, but man, this deer was born in the fence.
*  In Tennessee, you can't bring any genetics in.
*  You can't do anything.
*  Whatever herd you have, when you...
*  Wild herd.
*  Whatever wild Tennessee deer you have, you have to grow them.
*  And man, this deer, Joe, when he was two years old, we were like, what in the fuck...
*  What a UFO ship dropped this off in here.
*  He started with huge mass, different looking genetics, and we watched him for...
*  We grew him for...
*  We feel like he's five and a half.
*  And dude, we are over the moon about this deer.
*  Don't say it's stag.
*  I know.
*  That's a huge deer.
*  Over the moon.
*  How big is your property?
*  It's, I guess, all together, it's probably 11, probably 1,200 acres in the fence.
*  So that is much more space than a deer would ever travel in its natural life anyway.
*  I'll put it to you this way.
*  We put about 18 red stags in there.
*  There are...
*  We don't know how many there are.
*  That deer might have get fucked by a stag.
*  I think his mom...
*  Yeah, he might have...
*  That might be a hybrid.
*  He might have crossed a hybrid, yeah.
*  Dude, we will ride around.
*  We have too many stags and we'll try to thin them out.
*  Joe, we can't find them.
*  Like...
*  Literally like, we'll spend a day.
*  I'm like, hey, grab the rifle.
*  We're going to pull up here, walk this bottom.
*  Can't find them.
*  There's 60 of them in there.
*  We hunted them for four days this weekend.
*  We killed two.
*  So 1,200 is...
*  I mean...
*  It's much larger than a deer would have in its natural realm.
*  Yeah, and I...
*  Listen, there are a million ways you can criticize me for having the high fence.
*  But I have low fences that we bounce back and forth on the low fences.
*  Because that's fun as hell too, to not know what's walking in.
*  But the main thing is I wanted my boys to have the ability to manage deer and grow them.
*  I grew up...
*  I love South Texas.
*  Big, big...
*  I love South Texas deer hunting.
*  But I learned at least the South Texas place down here.
*  And then I learned having young children in my schedule, man, to go on a South Texas ranch,
*  commit that much to a South Texas ranch, and get five days there wasn't my thing.
*  So my high fence in Tennessee is kind of like my little ode, or my little homage, to my love for South Texas whitetails.
*  So you can keep it close?
*  Keep it close. It's 55 minutes from the house.
*  Oh, that's nice.
*  And it's a retreat. I get down there.
*  You know, Starlink has ruined us because now we have internet.
*  But before that, man, we'd pull in the hauler down there, and you'd have to drive up to the hill to make a phone call.
*  But oh, oh, Elon saved us on that.
*  Yeah, the new Starlink's wild. It's the size of like a notebook.
*  Well, what was funny is the first time we saw the satellites come over, we were at elk camp.
*  And you know, my nephew, Till, he's 21, and we're all liquored up.
*  And my nephew, he goes, guys, I know we've been drinking all day, but what in the hell is coming toward us right now?
*  And we were like, and then we had one guy in the group was like, God damn, that's Elon Musk.
*  And we watched it go over and we were like, wow, what a, what a.
*  It's amazing. We used one in Utah for the first time this year.
*  So easy to set up, set it up like five minutes. And then we're online.
*  You too.
*  I mean, my wife, when I went to elk camp, my wife was like, all right, I'll hear you. I'll see you.
*  I'll talk to you in six days. First day elk camp. Set the Starlink out.
*  FaceTime. Hey, baby. How are you?
*  Crazy. Yeah. My buddy was deer hunting recently in South Texas.
*  And he said on three different occasions in the week, their deer got bumped by illegals.
*  He said it was crazy. He said illegal aliens just moving through the ranch.
*  He said they have, you know, a swarm of them every day.
*  I hunt South Texas every year. And the ranch we went to last year,
*  at any given moment, you can drive and pick up 50 backpacks.
*  They just, that ranch looks like
*  when I, and I hadn't been, this ranch was closer to the border than I've ever been.
*  And there are piles of backpacks and tarps.
*  They'll take tarps and put the tarp out and they're due.
*  Well, they'll wait in the day and then they get, you know, they get picked up at night, typically.
*  But when they get picked up, they chunk their backpack and do the like that.
*  The ranch I was at, they have to have a full time team of people just going around picking up backpacks and keeping trash off the ranch.
*  My buddy, who has a ranch in South Texas, found a dead guy.
*  Found a guy ran out of water, just died on his ranch.
*  It's heartbreaking because, dude, if anybody, dude, I can't imagine having to walk through that brush to get to freedom.
*  Right. Because when I get back. Not knowing where you're going.
*  Not knowing where you're going and probably you have kids. Yeah.
*  Dude, when I leave South Texas, I'm pulling cactuses out of my ass for a month.
*  Yeah. Especially if you do, you know, you got rattle form and stuff.
*  So, man, it's. Forget about rattlesnakes. Forget about everything else that's down there.
*  And when water, yeah, when you think about me and you get your water rations. Yeah.
*  You miss that. Yeah. You could zig when you should have zagged and you're not going to run into water, especially down there.
*  And it was in the summer. So, you know, 105 degrees outside. This poor dude just died.
*  And they found him. Well, every ranch, every ranch, every ranch I've went to, the ranch owner,
*  you know, they're encountering two deaths a year, 15 to 20.
*  Most of the time they come up to the main headquarters needing water.
*  And when they get to you or that's been my experience with talking to ranch managers down there,
*  they're they're very, you know, they're not I don't think they're there to create any problems.
*  They just like, hey, you know, we're right. We need some water and the vast majority of them are just trying to get a better life, get a better life.
*  And we would be doing it, too. Could you imagine if you live in a third world country and you had kids and you realize you can get to America and you get a good job and you got to figure out how to do it?
*  Yeah, I would do it. We would all do it. We would all do it.
*  It's just the craziness of not knowing where you're going in South Texas, which is so vast.
*  I mean, I think it's one of those things where people talk about it. It's almost like talking about space, you know, like, oh, the galaxy is 200 million stars or 200 billion stars.
*  It doesn't make sense because it's like it's too big for you to understand. If you had to walk through South Texas, it's South Texas.
*  Well, Texas itself is bigger than like multiple countries in Europe. Yeah.
*  Well, I think, you know, and even imagine before, like the old booms and all ribs and stuff like now they have a little bit of visual right lights to walk to.
*  Right. Right. I mean, man, I couldn't imagine. Yeah.
*  Just striking out, just taking a chance, hoping, hoping or maybe you'd gone with someone who went through it before and they have a vague memory of what's the best way to get to a creek.
*  I don't know. I mean, I, you know, we we've been there and, you know, the guys, they open box blinds, you know, the deer hunting towers and there's a family sleeping in the box blind.
*  Man, you just got to you got to feel so sorry for them. I mean, how bad.
*  Look, I mean, I thought I mean, dude, I remember when I was 15, 16 years old processing Cubans where it's so bad that you're going to fucking piece together a raft and you're going to you're going to give it a you're going to give it a go for Miami.
*  Right. I remember being 16 going, how bad must that be? How bad must that be?
*  Pretty fucking bad. Pretty fucking bad.
*  Their case is a little different because they're running from a communist dictatorship and they're like, we got that's why the most Republican motherfuckers in this country are Cubans.
*  Cubans go hard. They're like, we've seen, we've seen what all this socialist horse shit comes down to.
*  And it comes down to government control over every aspect of your life.
*  And they enforce it with violence. They enforce it with guns.
*  It's not as simple as everybody just gives up whatever they have.
*  And now everybody has an equal amount. That's all nonsense.
*  That's the that's the hook. But the reality is the government controls everything and you are fucked.
*  And they always live in big ass houses and they eat great food and everybody else.
*  It's everywhere. It's from from Africa to Cuba to the whole African.
*  Yeah, that that whole. Have you ever hunted in Africa?
*  I haven't, but I know I will. I will.
*  I can go on this show and say, man, I'm not like a I'm not one of those guys that's like thinking about an elephant or lions and all that.
*  I just I love to bow hunt and I love I'd like planes, animals, you know, your kudos and all that stuff, man.
*  I, you know, to build when my boys get a little older and we can do a proper two month.
*  Currently, sports and my children have ruined my hunting life or my well, because my boys are going to play all the sports.
*  But when we can get a I'd love to do them a gap year and let's go do a true safari.
*  Yeah. And when I say so far, that doesn't mean I want to go like hunt 60 days.
*  I want to do like your I want to see the all of the Serengeti's and all of the animals and take in the animals for a month and have like the the wives and the girls and the girlfriends.
*  And we sit out there and do the safaris. But then I want to carve out two or three days with all the boys go, you know, go get the true planes game.
*  Yeah. And I would look it's me. I tell you, it's pretty cool story.
*  My my pilot, my lead pilot is South African.
*  And during covid, man, he couldn't his mother was dying and he couldn't get down there to tell his mother bye.
*  And at this point, I just I just kind of got to know AJ and man, I've always heard that South Africans are pretty bad ass dudes.
*  And at the time I was learning that AJ is a pretty bad ass dude.
*  I didn't know all together know it. But well, he caught he got with me and he goes, Luke, man, it's still I cannot get into South Africa.
*  It may have been his mother or his wife's mother, but I called some local guys, some local congress guys in Tennessee and they granted him permission to get down there.
*  And they got to tell either his wife's mother by way comes back and he's like, Luke, I now owe you a Cape Buffalo.
*  And I was like, what?
*  He goes, my family has a big ranch. We're overrun with Cape Buffalo and you now have one of my Cape Buffalo.
*  So, dude, he is going to fly me down there. And I'm like, and that's just kind of way he's he's he's wired.
*  But, you know, he's going to help us with some safari stuff.
*  Don't they call them the Black Death?
*  Yeah, now they are bad. Yeah. You don't just go running up to them.
*  Yeah.
*  Like with with your not your shit together.
*  That's a big animal.
*  It's like a 1800 pound animal, right?
*  Maybe bigger and like all muscle.
*  So Cam and Adam Green Tree, they went up to Australia.
*  You know, Australia has like an infestation of Asian buffalo.
*  They have I forget which type of buffalo it is, but invasive.
*  So someone introduced it like all the animals in Australia.
*  A lot of the mammals were introduced and they have no natural predators.
*  So they have these buffalo up there everywhere.
*  Cam said he shot one and he they, you know, they went up there with no food and they went up there to live off the land.
*  They're drinking out of fucking crocodile lakes, like literally bathing in that shit, filtering water, filtering water, eating whatever fish they caught.
*  It's Cam's new version of pushing himself. Now he's going to.
*  Now he's going to. I think it was Adam's idea.
*  Oh, I got you. He's a psycho, too.
*  So the both of them are perfect together.
*  So he said he had one piece of buffalo in his mouth for half an hour just chewing on it.
*  So that's how tough they are.
*  He said it took forever to eat that thing.
*  It's the true form of like, you know, that's even a whole nother level of true organics when it takes you.
*  Oh, yeah. You know, when you're jerky's jerky right out of the right out of the, you know, right in the field.
*  Yeah. Well, there's no dry aged buffalo out there.
*  Do you say I was a taste of it?
*  I mean, because most plains animals in Africa, historically, they say are far beyond our plains animals as far as the meat, like your kudus and your I mean, your I'm drawing a blank on all the plains games.
*  And like I said, this is stuff that I'm like totally elementary in because I don't I just don't know much about that whole African thing.
*  It seems like the things that the big cats want to eat are all delicious.
*  Right. Yeah. Like I shot a Neil guy a couple years ago and tigers eat them.
*  Right. Did you ever eat the Neil guy? Yes. Delicious.
*  And the meat is like even more vivid, a more vivid red color to it than even our, you know, our elk and stuff.
*  Well, it's all delicious.
*  My favorite is still elk. But another one is access deer. They get hunted by tigers and they're some of the best tasting animals alive.
*  Access deer are delicious.
*  Well, I think cats are smart, just like bears are smart, too. Salmon's delicious.
*  Sit there and pick them off.
*  They know what they're doing.
*  Well, have you done Africa? Are you going to do it?
*  I would like to. I'd like to go over to Africa.
*  So you're you you really got it.
*  Cam, was he kind of your catalyst?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And God, I mean, you pick it's like you had it's like you had Michael Jordan teach me how to play basketball.
*  Yeah, Michael Jordan teach you how to shoot free throws. Yeah.
*  It's so fun, though. But, you know, even with God, I tell you, man, I dove hard into duck hunting and you talk about you talk about, I mean, learning to blow a duck call.
*  And when you think you know how to blow a duck call and you get next to somebody that blows a duck call and you blow yours in the room starts laughing at you like like ridicule, like take your duck call off and put it in your bedroom and leave it when we go hunting.
*  And I'm like, dude, I've been working on this fucking thing for four years.
*  And they're like, and it's so funny, but like elk bugles.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone who sucks at bugling like you hear me like what the fuck was that?
*  I mean, it's like you walking in with a with a tutu on.
*  Yeah.
*  I love duck hunting, too.
*  I've never done it, but I love the idea of it because you're sneaking.
*  You're hiding.
*  You got fake ducks.
*  You get the whole deal.
*  So listen, some people have ducks that even have like floppy wings.
*  We got listen, man.
*  Let me tell you something, dude.
*  Dude, I got given a chocolate lab about eight years ago, and here comes this wormy ass chocolate lab into my home, you know, scrawny.
*  And since then, oh, my God, that damn animal has thrust me into duck hunting just so I could take him duck hunting.
*  And, man, it is that sounds like the same excuse used with the kids.
*  Right.
*  My kid.
*  Yeah.
*  I have to go for the dog.
*  I need some duck.
*  And my wife is this dog, man.
*  This dog can open every drawer in our house.
*  He can open Frito Lay's with his peek and smack Frito Lay's open and eat him.
*  He can he can he is he's he's pushed a porcelain pound cake, a pound cake on a porcelain island off onto the floor.
*  The pound cake and the porcelain dish and like x ray, 100 shards of porcelain in his stomach.
*  That's like put that fucker out in the yard because there's and if he makes it, if he lives, call me back.
*  He lived and now I have duck hunting properties and my boy, you know, so we're in the house blowing duck calls.
*  My wife's like, you know, I mean, my wife's like five or four boys in the house, all of them blowing duck calls.
*  She's like, man, one day.
*  Yeah.
*  So do you have one of them setups where you're like hiding in one of those shacks that's on the ground?
*  We have we have elevated blinds that are brushed in and some brush and then we have pit blinds that are, you know, when you get down in a pit blind, you're right along the water level.
*  And then, you know, we have, you know, there's experiences where you wait in the woods and they come down in the woods and man, it's just and it's the thing.
*  The thing that really makes duck hunting kind of like when you're in a blind with your with your let's just say you got your buddies from way back and there's five of you and you're sitting there smoking cigars.
*  And, you know, you're you're in the blind together and you're very it's very social to drink and coffee.
*  It's, you know, 15 degrees coffee cigar, you know, and everybody shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
*  And you work the ducks. They light in front of you.
*  Kill them. Dog gets them, brings a duck back.
*  You look at the duck and you're just like, just have a big old toke on your cigar.
*  And you're like, yeah, this is pretty good shit right here.
*  Are you good at cooking them?
*  Yeah, man. You know, the thing about it when you do, you know, your grain ducks, your ducks that feed on your rice and your and your your corn, you know, like a diver duck that eats essentially minnows.
*  Yeah, you know, you don't want to eat that.
*  But and geese, geeser, you find somebody that can cook a goose.
*  You know the story about how to cook a goose?
*  No.
*  Well, you get a big pot and you put your you put a you put a bunch of water and then you put a concrete cinder block in there and you boil the goose and you pull the goose out and eat the cinder block.
*  But some people can make.
*  I thought goose was like a thing.
*  A speckled goose speck. Speckled bellies are good.
*  But like a mallard and a wood duck.
*  Oh, man, a wood duck with jalapeno and cheese and bacon wrap, which nothing, nothing's bad when you do that.
*  But my friend Jesse Griffiths, he runs this restaurant out here called Die Due.
*  It's fantastic.
*  And he serves a lot of wild game.
*  And Jesse came on this hunt with us with Steve Rinella down in South Texas.
*  And Jesse cooks some diver duck.
*  And was it good?
*  It was fantastic.
*  Whoever the hell Jesse is.
*  He's a wizard.
*  He's a real chef.
*  Well, that so so Ryan Seacrest.
*  He's like, hey, man, Ryan Seacrest, the radio guy, my guy at American Idol.
*  And Seacrest goes, hey, I've got a you know, like he goes, dude, I booked this at EMP 11 Madison Park, number one at the time, number one restaurant in downtown.
*  You know, Adam was Ryan was taking me and Katie and Lionel to dinner.
*  And I've never been to the certainly the number one restaurant in the world.
*  Well, they take us to tour the kitchen and do they have ducks, walls, because all of your your French cuisine, the really the centerpiece is duck.
*  That's like the duck fat.
*  The ducks are the real big part of French cuisine.
*  Well, dude, I see these.
*  I see all these ducks and I'm like, what are you all doing here?
*  He goes, man, we're aging them.
*  So they get these now they're getting probably there.
*  They're getting farm raised, organically grown ducks, and they age them with with the guts in them.
*  Yeah, I've heard of that.
*  People do that with like pheasants to hang by the neck.
*  The enzymes of the guts pull stuff out of the meat.
*  Well, it adds a flavor to it, apparently.
*  And dude, man, I don't know.
*  It's catches me.
*  Well, here's the tricky part, because, dude, I don't even know if I enjoyed my meal because I picked the chef's brain because I wanted to figure out a way to take my mallards in all my ducks.
*  I killed an agent properly.
*  But what you do got to worry about is when you shoot them, you know, you're putting you know, you're shooting.
*  It's the guts are going right through kind of in the meat a little bit.
*  So that gets you shoot them.
*  Yeah, that's different.
*  You know, I didn't get that good where I all headshot them yet.
*  But when these guys are ageing them, what's the temperature in the room?
*  I think it's I think it's like a you know, just above they're not freezing them.
*  I think it's however you would dry age a cow.
*  So like 40 degrees.
*  40 degrees and 1315 days with the guts in them and then 15 days with the guts in them.
*  I've heard that people hang their pheasants until their their heads fall off.
*  And that's when they that's when they cut them up.
*  Who figured that out?
*  Who was the bold bastard?
*  It's the guy that ate the first oyster.
*  Right.
*  You know, Drake out of the puddle.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. And you know, it is fascinating and pheasant.
*  And when you look at pheasant and quail and chuckers and, you know, Hungarian parcher.
*  Now you're talking about the you're talking about the end all of a wild game, in my opinion, the top of the.
*  That's what you like the most.
*  Well, I think when you look at the pheasants, you know, they're you know, they call them prairie chickens and they're beautiful.
*  The meat's a little wider and less gamey or so.
*  Have you had Sandhill Crane?
*  Yes.
*  I have it.
*  But it's crazy to look at it.
*  It does look like steak.
*  It's a red meat, a deep red meat.
*  And it's a bird.
*  And, you know, they're they're wild little creatures, too, man.
*  You know, when you when you take your lab Sandhill Crane hunt, you got to you got to fit them with goggles because of poker.
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  And then we I just got in a golf course property down in Florida.
*  And we sold our beach house and then we're kind of migrating to this place.
*  And I fly down to the tour of the property and I'm like, dude, what are what are you all doing with all these Sandhill Crane's?
*  And they're like, what do you mean?
*  It's like a golf course guy.
*  And I said, dude, that's the real by the sky, bro.
*  He's like he looked it up and you can't shoot Sandhill Crane's in Florida.
*  What?
*  I do.
*  They are somebody called the governor everywhere.
*  Really?
*  Everywhere on this property.
*  You can't shoot Sandhill Crane's in Florida, but you can shoot alligators.
*  I unless they're lying to me because they're scared I'm going to go like I'm going to like, you know, have a psychotic episode and go running out there the golf course with a with a gun.
*  Maybe it's just the area where you're at.
*  You could say they may be protected in certain counties.
*  But, you know, even in Tennessee, for the center, none of the federal protected under Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
*  Look at that shit.
*  Wow.
*  State rule, blah, blah, blah.
*  Intentional feeding of Sandhill Crane's is prohibited.
*  So you can't hunt them.
*  Wow.
*  They're protected.
*  Well, in Tennessee, we have in Tennessee, there's a couple of guys that got them.
*  And I think it's a draw tag.
*  You can draw.
*  You can put in to draw a Sandhill Crane tag.
*  And then, man, they make a they make a very distinct.
*  Something like that.
*  And, dude, you can hear them and I'll hear them coming over my farm.
*  And, God, if that's the wrong noise I just made, I'm going to get.
*  Sounds good.
*  I'm going to.
*  You got it.
*  Whoa.
*  I love this guy.
*  I need me one of.
*  That's them.
*  Wow.
*  Now, that's.
*  All of them.
*  Yeah, that's.
*  Yeah, hear that.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  That's a good one.
*  All of them.
*  Yeah, that's.
*  You hear that?
*  Yeah.
*  What a fucking cool animal.
*  They sound like something from Avatar.
*  See those beaks?
*  Yeah.
*  Those are Labrador blind Labrador retriever blinders right there.
*  How do you fasten the goggles on a dog?
*  Man.
*  Oh, God, here he goes.
*  Oh, my God.
*  This is like the.
*  You'll find it.
*  Sandhill Crane goggles for labs.
*  This is going to be great.
*  How does it secure on?
*  I'm thinking about a dog's face.
*  I guess you've seen those dogs in those side cars on the.
*  Motorcycles.
*  On the motorcycles.
*  Probably that rig.
*  But.
*  I mean, I Googled something and that's not there.
*  I don't think that's the same.
*  Yeah, that's like.
*  That's an Aspen.
*  That's two dogs being silly.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But the.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah, so in Tennessee you can hire a guy and he'll take you and they'll kind of get them
*  coming into an area and I think you.
*  Yeah, there you go.
*  Oh, there you go.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Oh, that's crazy.
*  Now those look like I think those are snow geese.
*  Snow geese are probably the same.
*  Look at their goggles all scratched up too.
*  Yeah.
*  Crane hut.
*  No, those are.
*  Yeah, those are sand hills.
*  Wow, that's crazy.
*  Look at that.
*  Dogs need to have their eyes protected.
*  Yeah, so when you get.
*  Yeah, well, you've got your gold.
*  But man, if you get your lav and oh man, beware of that because you will get hooked.
*  Oh, I'm sure I would be.
*  Also, I love duck.
*  Duck's delicious.
*  Oh, on the grill, marinated and marinated properly for a day or two, plan on it.
*  That's what Jesse does.
*  That's the difference.
*  You got to plan on it.
*  That's what he does, the diver duck.
*  I'm telling you, this diver duck was sensational.
*  Well, but when that and that's the that's what you got to watch in all wild game is,
*  man, plan it.
*  Preparation.
*  Get it marinated.
*  And man, you just can't beat it.
*  Yeah, you got to know what you're cooking, how to cook it, especially if you're cooking
*  something that has low body fat.
*  You got to make sure you cook it nice and slow.
*  Right.
*  You know, that's one of the great things about things like a Traeger.
*  You can just set it for $265.
*  Best thing in the world.
*  Leave it.
*  The new one's fantastic, too.
*  It's just everything comes out so smoky and delicious.
*  If you know, my dad, Fourth of July, he was I think he was drunk and hated us on Fourth
*  of July because he stayed up smoking the Boston Bud every night.
*  You know, I remember my dad, man, he he had that old char broil out there and he'd get
*  up with his vinegar and all this shit.
*  And he would wake up all night, night before the fourth and smoke them butts, man.
*  And now you just walk out, put that thing on 220 at about 8 p.m., wake up at 8 a.m.
*  and the app tells you if you're low on pellets.
*  I know it's like, what are we doing here?
*  It's crazy.
*  So much easier.
*  There's something that men are attracted to like cooking over wood, though, like an actual
*  fire charcoal in Texas, you know, right here.
*  I mean, these guys take a damn, you know, they they they glue four propane tanks together
*  and have a smokestack and the guy that what's our guy that does our charity event?
*  Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm I'll come up with him.
*  But Mark, text me.
*  Meat Church. Have you met the meat church?
*  I met that dude. Yeah, he comes and he's got some awesome rubs.
*  He's got all that. But then what's funny is, yeah, he pulled up to our charity event with his big
*  smoker. And man, I'm like, this is like Elon Musk style engineering on this thing.
*  It's pretty, you know, and man, you know, they get out there and yeah, they'll look at me and you doing Trager's and we're
*  that's about like us. That's our version of having a tutu on.
*  It is funny because people want to do it all themselves.
*  The offset smokers like if you ever gone to Terry Black's here, see the lines of the offset smokers.
*  Terry Black's is the number one barbecue place in the country, probably in the world.
*  They cook more volume of barbecue than anywhere else on the country.
*  And they have just line after line of these giant propane tank smokers and they just briskly and ribs and spare ribs.
*  See, when I when I moved to Nashville being a South Georgia boy, I'd never even heard of brisket.
*  Really? We there was we only knew pork barbecue.
*  And it's just so when I moved to Nashville and then like there's some dude there with a Texas brisket restaurant in Nashville,
*  I'm like, what are they talking about brisket?
*  And this was 2001 I moved to Nashville. This is how insulated you could be in your own.
*  You know, as we talk about the ways of the world changing, I mean, it's like, dude, I lived in a section and everybody North Carolina,
*  Georgia, Alabama, they didn't brisket was like, I think brisket was originally a German thing.
*  I think it's like with the sausages, like there was cuts of the meat.
*  Well, the smoker thing came certainly from German immigrants that came to Texas.
*  That's where the origin of the barbecue out here.
*  And then the whole and then the brisket was like cuts that nobody else wanted.
*  Right. So they figured out a way to take these cuts that nobody else wanted and turn them into something delicious.
*  They just had to do it over time. And now it's like a preferred cut.
*  You know, if you go to Terry Black's, the brisket sensational.
*  And they're probably cooking.
*  Yeah, the preferred cuts of like which cut of the brisket would you like?
*  Not the not the old flank meat down there.
*  You know, probably you can probably get the rib eye and all that.
*  It's all just how long you cook it for.
*  How do you how you do it? What temperature?
*  And they they wrap it and they unwrap it and they spray it like they have it down to a science.
*  And then at the end, it's like the key is you want to be able to fold it over your finger and not have a break apart.
*  Just get it to just where it folds over.
*  And so our deal was just always smoke a big pig, you know, smoke a pig, you know, you know, not not the not the ones big as this table, but you know, about that.
*  100 pounder. Yeah.
*  And walk up there on the family reunion and all the women were grossed out because, you know, you're just pulling the big pig.
*  You know, the big you know, you can pull that meat off a pig.
*  It's like that. So we're getting hungry, Joe.
*  I know that's the good thing about wild pigs, too.
*  So they're always available to hunt like the one of the great things about Texas.
*  It's it's not good if you're on a ranch or if you have a farm.
*  But if you're a person who wants to hunt, you can hunt wild pigs.
*  So five days a year and always have sausage.
*  Our place and me and my best friend, we've got a like a quail hunting place and down in the heart of South Georgia, tons of swamps.
*  Did we were. Which, you know, all the math and I'm sure you've brought it up on how many sow pigs.
*  You know, they'll kick off 30, 30 pigs a year.
*  And then we would have we would have them roll through our front front yard.
*  Thirty thousand dollars of damage a night. Yeah.
*  And the most for anybody out there listening, if you have this going on, we mounted we mounted lights in all the trees around our whole lodge.
*  And you flip them lights on and we had one wild hog root up our yard since they will not come around those lights.
*  They don't. They it's a great tactic.
*  That's interesting. Yeah. And when somebody told him, you know, some good old boy told him and he was like, man, we'll try anything because you would walk out there and it looked like 300 landmines went off in the night before our yard looked like Augusta.
*  Yeah, it's crazy, isn't it? I mean, they are they're bad little dudes.
*  They do a lot of damage. I mean, in Texas alone, it's millions and millions of dollars of damage of crops every year.
*  They shoot them out of helicopters here. You ever seen you ever done that? Have you?
*  It is. Man, it is. It's the most unfair type of hunting that's ever existed.
*  Man, if I don't know, you know, my children, I took my boys and somewhere there's a, you know, I hope he doesn't hear, but there's a Navy SEAL Marine recruiter because my sons are ready for warfare after doing that.
*  I'm like, but you know, my the guy that we took, you know, he's got a big, beautiful high fence and me, you know, you get you fly around and man, you can, you know, you just he has to thin them out every year.
*  Yeah, you have to. But it's so fun doing it out of a helicopter. You don't want to send them all out because you keep wanting to, you know, you keep wanting to do it a little bit.
*  But, but it's you hadn't done that yet. No, no, I'm still I just mostly bow hunt him.
*  Well, you know, the our pig stuff in Georgia, man, it's fun because you can go on a deer hunt and shoot some deer with a bow and then we'll take a rifle and late in the evening, the hogs will come out and and you know, a lot of guys shoot them at nighttime too.
*  Yeah, yeah. And then we thermals, we have guys with the big, you know, with the big, you know, trap doors that trap them and stuff like that.
*  So, I mean, they're they're they're probably the number one, you know, wildlife.
*  I never will forget, you know, right when like maybe iPhones come out and you get your iPhone news updates and then I never even knew what the magazine like the New Yorker was or like the Guardian and all those things.
*  Well, the New Yorker I'm scrolling through and I see feral pigs and it was this huge article done by a guy, maybe the editor of the New Yorker.
*  Man, he did a great job with that article and just went through and this was 15 years ago.
*  I read that article about, you know, the feral hog problems and, you know, you would think I would I don't know.
*  I would think the New Yorker leans quite leans quite left with the fact that this guy wrote the article from a perspective of huge problem need to be need to be dealt with was pretty pretty badass take on it.
*  So, well, once people see the sheer numbers, they're so overwhelming that you go, wait a minute.
*  How how are you going to stop this? How are you going to stop it from multiplying continually every year?
*  Well, you're not you're not.
*  Well, then places do not going to get to what is Georgia and these these swampy deals you can't you know you can't you can't helicopter them there.
*  So that's when you get you know that's when you get these old boys with their with their dogs and they run off in the runoff and that'll help.
*  But even then, here's another thing you think about this.
*  So when I start my high fence with the year that I that year that I started it, our turkey population in Tennessee, which it's been going through hell.
*  And you'll hear this.
*  The turkey population in Tennessee was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.
*  I mean, eastern turkey hunting, one of the most beautiful things in the wildlife that the state of Tennessee has.
*  And in my turkey population was like is amazing and still is.
*  But we hired a guy and he put one hundred and ten traps out.
*  One hundred and ten.
*  And night one had a hundred over a hundred varmints, coons, possums, armadillos in the traps.
*  Night one. So they're just killing all the turkeys. They eat the eggs.
*  You know, they're you know, a turkey lays twelve to fourteen eggs.
*  Now, listen, I found this out this year. This is going to I hope I if I can get a couple of nuggets that you hadn't learned yet.
*  That's that's kind of the goal for the day. So and turkey does not lay their eggs all at the same time.
*  Really? They lay their eggs one day at a time.
*  They will they lay it next to a water source.
*  They go to the water source, hold the water in their mouth, drip the water on the eggs periodically, using the water to hatch them at the same time.
*  Because a hen turkey, if she had to hatch all the eggs hatch at the same time.
*  But if she had to hatch them for twelve days, she could never keep them corralled properly.
*  So she manipulates with water.
*  And if I'm wrong, now this is a biologist that told me that I heard this this year totally blew my mind.
*  So in the nest and I've walked up on them, they got twelve or thirteen of them sitting there beautifully.
*  And whatever that hen does, she manages those eggs to hatch at the same time.
*  And maybe maybe now like a tortoise, I guess, or a beach turtle or whatever.
*  You know, I think they they spit them all out that night.
*  But a hen a hen turkey does not. Well, so one armadillo rolls by that nest.
*  And that's a wrap. That's a wrap. She just lost them all.
*  And so there was a big study that went on in Tennessee about the decline of the turkey population.
*  So what do they do about that? They try to hunt the varmints?
*  Well, you know, trapping now is so rare.
*  Trapping, the art of trapping has gone down quite a bit in the arm of the.
*  Oh, and I'm not even bringing up coyotes in Tennessee.
*  So, yeah, if you can, if they can loosen up, Tennessee can loosen up their trapping laws and make it more available.
*  And you just got to thin out those, you know, armadillos in Tennessee, you would have never.
*  Man, we woke up and we can ride around and shoot 30 a night.
*  Really? Armadillo is 30 on a.
*  Don't they carry like crazy? Man, I wouldn't recommend touching them.
*  You know, they they, you know, they say they do.
*  But that's that may believe them.
*  I've never heard of that, but you probably can find.
*  Definitely raccoons. They definitely raccoons and definitely.
*  I don't know about possums, but if you if you're eating a possum, you're you're you're you're as hungry.
*  So hungry. But raccoons, I mean, in Georgia, where we grew up, had several old timers, man, they get them a coon.
*  And it was always a kind of a party deal.
*  You know, what does raccoon taste like? I never had.
*  I never. Well, we got an old buddy down there.
*  He's like, you know what bald eagle tastes like?
*  Ow. So I guess you could say, you know, I had a buddy of mine tell a game more than that joke.
*  It didn't go over well. So but there's a lot of shit that people eat that people would go, what?
*  Yeah. I mean, when you're talking about.
*  Yeah, I saw somebody do the pig deal with a full gator.
*  Oh, I've seen that before. And I hadn't done that.
*  I've had Gator tail, but I had a giant smoker and put a Gator in there.
*  Put the whole thing on. Yeah.
*  And they skin, you know, skin it and all that apple in its mouth.
*  Yeah. You know, it's crazy in Georgia.
*  There's a there's a place rural.
*  So all the chicken farms down there, huge chicken farms, all of them.
*  Well, what do you do with the chicken carcasses?
*  Well, I mean, there's a lot that used to grind them up and feed them back to chickens.
*  But some of them get well, they feed them to Gator farms.
*  Oh, wow. They put them in a put them in a limb, a limb shredder.
*  Oh, wow. Now you talk about the most foul smell on the planet.
*  Go into a Gator farm warehouse.
*  Joe, buddy, just rot.
*  Nothing can replicate. Maybe the Sustramen challenge can rep, you know, the the whole Sustramen joke thing.
*  But what's that? You've seen where the guys pop the lid on the Swedish fish?
*  No. Oh, Joe, Sustramen.
*  What is it? Oh, we did it at our at our deer camp.
*  It's like an aged Swedish fish that's rotten in a can.
*  It's aged for years like a sardine.
*  And so, yeah, the Sustramen challenge.
*  Please, gosh face.
*  Dude, we pop that thing.
*  So people fish with them. They use it for bait, like for catfish.
*  Look, people eat that. Oh, foul.
*  And if you can stay in the room with it.
*  Have you tried it? Dude, no one.
*  I know I was outside 15 yards from it, throwing up in the flower bed.
*  All right, we got to order some, Jamie.
*  Or order some. I'm glad I didn't get you.
*  I might eat it on Fight Companion.
*  But, um. Well, Denver's on the verge of passing a no fur law.
*  So if Denver passes a no fur law, what are they going to do about cowboy hats that have beaver skin lining?
*  And then if you're going to say no fur, how are you going to say no fur, but you're allowing leather?
*  So skin is OK as long as you take the furry part off.
*  Is the furry part what's offensive?
*  You know what you'd fucking the chaos that would ensue if you outlawed leather?
*  Everybody's belt is illegal. Everybody's shoes are legal.
*  Air Jordans are calling it illegal. Illegal.
*  Yeah, they're trying to pass a law.
*  They're trying to pass a law where they ban fur.
*  Sorry. They've done it before.
*  I mean, they've done it. Where is it?
*  Like I said, where does it?
*  Joe, I'm out with it. It just keeps going.
*  That's the problem. I'm an American idol. It never fucking ends.
*  When I'm in America. No, it never.
*  It's never going to end. They're going to keep pushing.
*  It'll get to you can't eat meat.
*  It'll get to it has to be lab grown.
*  It'll get to it. It could get as crazy as you could ever imagine.
*  There's animal rights people that would like to push it in that direction.
*  And you would have never thought this would be possible.
*  But you would have never thought that you would have biological males competing against females in high school sports.
*  And that's everywhere. And if you complain against that, you're a bigot.
*  You're seeing the craziest of crazy thinking.
*  There's people that think the pedophiles are minor attracted persons.
*  And they'll they'll talk about this as university professors teaching classes.
*  It's been recorded. People have seen it.
*  It's not everywhere, but it's enough where you go.
*  I see where this goes.
*  If it keeps going because none of this shit existed 20 years ago.
*  You go back to 2004, there was none of this shit.
*  Nothing. A transgender person was a rare person with gender dysphoria.
*  It was very rare. And there wasn't a lot of hatred towards those people.
*  Wasn't the thing that people worried about.
*  Now there is because everybody's like, what the fuck?
*  Why is this in schools? Why are you having them?
*  There was a recent pool tournament where it was a women's pool tournament in the semifinals.
*  It's two trans trans women may be against each other, two men, two biological men that wear lipstick competing against each other in a women's tournament.
*  It's fucking crazy. So I would have never thought that would be possible.
*  So it can get to a point where there's no meat.
*  It can get to the point where meat there's this demonization of meat.
*  You keep hearing about it all the time.
*  Meat is the number one source of carbon. It's fucking complete total horse shit.
*  It's not even number two. It's not number three.
*  It's not even fucking close.
*  Cow farts.
*  Yeah, it's the dumbest shit ever.
*  And by the way, all of that is factory farming.
*  Regenerative farming is actually carbon neutral.
*  If it doesn't, if they don't sequester carbon, it's actually good for carbon.
*  There's a whole reason why there's a balanced ecosystem of cows eating grass and the grass fermenting in their stomach and then creating manure.
*  And that regenerates, regenerates.
*  It's carbon neutral.
*  It's actually good for the environment and everything feeds off everything.
*  There's a system that nature has evolved for millions of years.
*  That's that's the normal way it's supposed to be done.
*  And, you know, we're just living in a crazy time.
*  Yeah, when you think of Denver and Colorado and the outdoors, man, you got to appreciate everybody's opinion of, you know, you know, the growth.
*  I mean, it's a it's a so old term, the granolaist.
*  Yeah, it ain't granola no more.
*  I mean, it's it's it's getting a lot further than granola.
*  Granola used to be normal until they see.
*  The thing is, those people were weird and rare and they were tolerated.
*  But then they got online and say if there's only 10 of them in this town, five of them in that town.
*  Well, now there's hundreds of thousands of them collectively in the country, all as a group.
*  And then they think that they're activists.
*  So they think that they're doing something good.
*  So then they start saying things like no fur in Colorado.
*  Pass this bill.
*  You start saying no meat, no more meat.
*  No one should have meat.
*  All right.
*  What are you going to do with these cows?
*  What are you going to do?
*  You're going to go around castrating all those bulls.
*  What are you going to do?
*  How are you going to control the populations?
*  You going to let them go extinct.
*  You're going to castrate all the bulls.
*  Are you going to let some of them breed?
*  How are you going to make this distinction?
*  Are you going to bring in wolves to handle them?
*  What are you going to do?
*  What the fuck are you going to do?
*  What are you going to do with all those people that work at the butcher shop?
*  What are you going to do with all those people that work at the meat processing plant?
*  What do you do with all those people that have been transporting meat back and forth?
*  We do all those jobs, all those families, all their income, all their businesses that they've had for a hundred fucking years.
*  What are you going to do with that?
*  that these people have like the most minimal understanding of the system
*  they're trying to influence they don't know what the fuck they're doing by
*  releasing wolves they think wolves are beautiful
*  yay see the governor he's releasing the wolves like yay he's like so happy yeah
*  they're gonna be saying yay when they're when they're damn I don't know dude the
*  whole dogs getting eaten dog everything let me tell you so well now that they
*  brought in wolves that had a history of killing cattle the wolves they brought
*  into Colorado it's no different than the grizzly focusing on the on humans and
*  man we I live just south of Nashville we got 180 acres I've got neighborhoods all
*  around us man about every nine an email goes out little Fluffy's gone coyotes we
*  put six coyote traps out on my farm one night six for six Wow and let me tell
*  you what else is a little vicious son of a bitch a fucking otter oh yeah
*  otters will fuck you up let me tell you buddy those things are I mean Joe I'm so
*  like but I mean that week like I said my brain is bass fishing and all this stuff
*  man we'll have otters come up into my bass pond I'm talking about they're
*  fucking gone the fish in three nights the fish are gone and the otters eat one
*  and play with the other ones that they kill Wow and like you go by my lake like
*  I have an all-female bass like at my house which you're gonna this is a whole
*  another fun deal they will roll through there and eat my all females and just
*  throw them up on the bank there's carcasses how many oh you get four
*  otters in your pond on a 17 acre lake they'll eat 20 bass a night and you the
*  problem is you don't know you been got until you've been got Wow and so Joe a
*  tit to grow a ten pound bass is about $3,000 and think about I've been loving
*  on these damn fish I've been walking out there making sure they're happy so my
*  we can all catch them and yeah and then damn them damn otters wrote so they'll
*  if you have an overflow a spillway on your farm and it runs through your farm
*  and dumps into a major river body of water and that otter swims by that water
*  dumping in that river he is up that river he's up that spillway into your
*  lake and he is he has gotcha wow and we'll put traps out dude and man they
*  just keep coming Wow keep coming and I'm talking about otter pelts I mean like
*  the prettiest thing you've ever seen so do you turn them into coats or anything
*  you I mean we've got enough where you know we can we've got them skinned out
*  in freezers and rolled up in our freezers and my farm guys I mean I think
*  you know the sad part is there the market for that should be an amazing
*  market but I don't I think because everybody's scared to say they got a
*  damn otter pelt yeah you know but yeah fur it's first got a bad name if it's
*  got hair on it leather's fine none of it's fine but leather's fine with people
*  no one has a problem with you wearing cowboy boots nobody gets mad yeah see
*  leather nobody gets mad at leather all that is is fur with no no fucking hair
*  on it it's the same thing it's weird but damn otters man them little rascals you
*  know they um I got I'm building a lake at my place in Georgia and it's right on
*  the Flint River running wildlife management I love it man it's it's so
*  fun it's so damn fun like it's it's four hours of my day and it also cleanses
*  your mind right totally it's totally and it is not for myself you can't my
*  enjoyment is to watch the kid my front my buddies my children's friends come
*  enjoy it too you know my sons will bring a buddy home from school and next thing
*  you know Tate and his 13 year old buddy are shooting bows in the front yard all
*  weekend and this kid who doesn't have a dad that hunts or has the ability next
*  thing you know we I got one kid my buddy James his eighth consecutive weekend at
*  my house hunting just loving live shooting bow and arrows did you show
*  him how to shoot correctly got it all got him dialed in he shot his first doe
*  this weekend nice just so fun and so so you know when you meet these guys that
*  they don't let anybody else enjoy it I don't like those guys either yeah and
*  and you know I love to love to enjoy it with people but you know bass fishing
*  things a blast but my lake in in Georgia it's gonna be about 35 acres and I think
*  we'll do an all-female lake down there why all-female so that way they can't
*  breed your females are your trophy bass right the big fat ones the big fat ones
*  don't they have to get pregnant to be really big and fat you put them in and
*  if you don't they don't have to be pregnant well they just have to have the
*  big eggs and when they lay them they just have to have oh I get it not
*  fertilizer that's right of course so if you get a male in there then the male
*  then you have a natural thriving he'll eat the babies too though right they'll
*  bass will forage on themselves yeah and but male bat now I have three lakes that
*  are naturally their own ecosystem where we have to you know I've got an 82 acre
*  bass lake that we have to catch 3,500 pounds of bass a year just to keep them
*  from not choking themselves out really oh yeah it's 35 hundred pounds so how
*  do you do just call your friends do we have bass roundups and we get out there
*  and we catch them and we'll load up coolers and take them into the little
*  towns and give them you know we have given to people and I mean it becomes a
*  problem it's a weird thing with largemouth bass too because a lot of
*  people don't eat them and yet they're delicious they're good they're great
*  yeah great they're basically the same as bluegills well bluegills bluegills you
*  know like all the bluegills at my lake are we feed them pellet food so they'll
*  get big so the bass will eat them so the bass will get big and you don't want to
*  go eat a bluegill that's been parked under a pellet yeah but a little wild
*  bluegill stream or a little natural creek where I grew up in Georgia like
*  shell crackers and bluegill that eat like a cricket or that are eating live
*  stuff you fillet one of them real small creek or river bluegills and fry them up
*  oh nothing better in the world yeah and then bass is similar to that oh bass if
*  you like you white meat flaky white meat get you a three or four pound bass
*  fillet it like a red snapper but people like catching them so much they want you
*  to release them we we spent our whole life my dad would catch bass we would
*  fillet them he put them in a Pyrex dish saute them bake them and then broil them
*  on top and we'd eat largemouth bass you know you could either have
*  salmon croquettes that stink up the whole house you know where you knew your
*  mama was cooking them or you can have fresh bass you know so we grew up but
*  isn't it a weird animal or weird fish rather that a lot of people don't eat
*  but it's good to eat you know you wouldn't want you wouldn't want your you wouldn't want
*  everybody fish fishing your big reservoirs like Texas is the best big
*  bass lake reservoir state right in the country you wouldn't want everybody out
*  there keeping them you know you want to practice you want to practice catch and
*  release on your big public reservoirs right but you know when you've got a
*  private impoundment where you know you know you'd want you you want to you want
*  to keep your bass because your bass you'll wake up let's just let's just say
*  you've got a nice brand-new bass like you built ten acres you stock it you
*  spend 50 grand to put your bluegill you're all your fish in there well you
*  know then you just don't ever catch them well then in five years you've lost it
*  you have to manage it yeah you're done your lakes done your your your your
*  three-pound bass didn't have enough fish to get to four pounds and then he missed
*  a year growing or she missed a year growing and then you just put a
*  fifty thousand dollar investment in your bass lake and then you're out you might
*  as well drain it start over you know what I'd really like to do get a place
*  in the north and have a lake with pike in it I think they might be my favorite
*  thing to catch because they're so ruthless that's such a ruthless fish
*  animal fucking dinosaur a killer those are dinosaurs first time I caught a pike
*  I'm like why isn't this like the most exciting thing to catch they fight hard
*  or a musky cheese I've never caught one of those me either that's the fish out
*  of we got a little thousand casts yeah see I'm not a dude I'm not that dude now
*  I'll wait and hunt it you know I'm not a arm like I don't have to have the
*  biggest best animal my whole life like I don't roll you know some people they're
*  like they get into numbers or size Queens site yeah or score I'm not that
*  guy I'm an experienced let's have fun let's see a lot of animals let's catch a
*  lot of fish let's keep a lot of action yeah let's keep the kids engaged yeah you
*  know like when when my boys were you know when my boys were four and five I
*  take them you don't want to take them out there on their first three bass
*  fishing trips and you burn them in the hot Sun and they catch one fish right
*  you want them engaged engaged and get them get them going but uh yeah pike and
*  all that that you know still heading that northwest still heading catching
*  one man I don't that's just I hadn't done that I can't do that that's a
*  release fish too right those are those are the yeah those are high on the list
*  of especially like a sea run steelheads mm-hmm you know you have you have some
*  that are kind of locked in you know locked in the reservoir locked mm-hmm
*  but you get those those big sea run steelheads and they really hold them and
*  they should hold them in high regard you shouldn't you need to leave those alone
*  and let them you know let them come and go yeah but then why you catching them
*  you know said why you fucking with those fish I get it it's fun I'm not opposed
*  to it I get it but if I catch fish I like to eat them that's the whole reason
*  why I'm catching fish say that yeah you know what it's why I like to catch wall
*  I would still say you're in the majority yeah yeah you're in it should be I mean
*  imagine if you just run around shooting deer with tranquilized darts like I got
*  them well weird little weird yeah I've proved that you did it yeah you know
*  and then they make bumper you know they make bumper tips on bows you can doink
*  don't deer in ass and run them off and not yeah you know and then like why you
*  don't get a deer in the ass you know it's a little weird looks like they make
*  those club heads so you can shoot squirrels and birds yeah well you know
*  man listen dude I grew up you know my little town of Leesburg man I mean every
*  year I got a pellet gun for Christmas and I got a I got a full camo onesie or
*  a cover all and dude I put my new pair of Chippewa hunting boots I put my new
*  set of I put my new set of coveralls on with the camo pattern I'd hit the
*  neighborhood walking around with a pellet gun shooting the neighbor squirrels
*  and you know we we'd eat them you know we'd eat them every night and this little
*  lady Mabel Coxwell she we'd skin them and she'd fry them with some wild rice
*  and it tastes good if you cook a squirrel do it right man it ain't
*  nothing wrong with a squirrel isn't that crazy that most people don't know that
*  right squirrels are delicious squirrel honey is like very popular squirrel
*  dumpling squirrel dumplings yeah it's instead of chicken chicken and
*  dumplings squirrel dumplings you know you get a squirrel and clean it right and
*  brine it for the night and cook it with dumplings and put some onions and celery
*  and all that and you're off to the races people think of them they have like
*  fluffy tail privilege rats with tails because you see a rat rats have those
*  slimy tails and people like that's disgusting and they see that fluffy tail
*  like oh so cute not much different you know well the the fact that you know the
*  fact that yeah I could run rampant with a eight year nine years old through the
*  neighborhood riding my Honda 50 motorcycle you know through people's
*  backyards you know chasing squirrels and everybody's like thank you that damn
*  thing's been in my attic chewing up my my pink panther insulation for that's
*  rural life right yeah people well that's people that understand what's
*  going on yeah that's the difference between you did that in a neighborhood in
*  Manhattan people like what the fuck is this guy doing we need these squirrels
*  if you they caught you in Central Park with a pellet gun you go to jail first
*  first round ticket first yes you not do not pass go do not collect breaking to a
*  store and rob it nothing will happen to you they'll let you right out yeah but
*  if you get caught in Central Park shooting squirrels and eating them you're
*  gonna get in real trouble it's wild we live in a wild world it's a very strange
*  distorted version of what human beings have been experiencing for most of
*  history no I mean nothing is wrong with hunting a little bit especially when 95
*  percent of the world eats meat it's a stupid argument well and I think you
*  know I think it's all treated to I think now the beauty is now the education of
*  you know I mean you look at you know you look at the how great you know
*  carnivore diets are being you know I've never done like a big old Connor have
*  you ever done a big carnivore oh yeah yeah they change your life oh yeah that's
*  mostly how I eat great I eat fruit and meat great 99% I fuck around like my
*  daughter likes to cook cookies I had a big-ass cookie the other day I mean I'm
*  not ridiculous yeah I'll eat other things I'm not religious about it but
*  most of my diet like 90% is just meat and occasionally fruit fruit before I
*  work out fruit sometimes after I work out but mostly it's just meat well you
*  know like I said the best thing about what you do here is you give everybody
*  their platform to talk about their their way yeah and and you know your platform
*  is enlighten me I mean you know dude I've never you know I was around some
*  dude that was talking about you know microdosing mushrooms and all that do
*  I never saw a drug I never saw a drug until I was 30 saw moonshine a lot of
*  drug well that is a fucking drug well you're right I mean you drink you drink
*  a half jar of Mason you know oh yeah yeah that's the crazy thing about alcohol
*  is we get some ass put thing yeah we are having nicotine right now this is a
*  drug and when I have these a nice cigar by the way it's perfect it's very good
*  very mild and man when I was 39 years old before I did any tobacco really
*  never dipped my dad kept Levi Garrett Taylor's pride you know the only time he
*  wasn't chewing meant he had a life insurance policy he had a he had a he
*  had to get blood work and didn't want to fail his life insurance policy but I was
*  39 my mom you know my mom's a my mom's a character sheep you know but um never
*  did tobacco never dip I put one dip in one time and threw up outside the
*  outside my high school this old boy threw me a dip in and dude big old Kodiak
*  and I threw up outside the high school gymnasium and missed my fifth and sixth
*  period and I was like dude I don't need that remember those bricks little squares
*  of chewing tobacco you bite a chunk off oh yeah although and well what I was
*  getting at is I was sitting we were celebrating of album release I was 39
*  years old one of my best buddies brought a nice davidoff Churchill cigar in any
*  cigar I'd ever done I had smoked a cigar like in Vegas and most time back then you
*  know I didn't drink a handle of crown and smoke cigar you wake up the next
*  morning you're like you know your life's over essentially well it's probably the
*  handle of crown right well we smoked that cigar and I sat in my rocking chair
*  and just smoked that cigar and I was like man this is kind of it's kind of
*  nice this is kind of like therapy right here people smoking cigars aren't stupid
*  it's got to be something to it and they're chilled out yeah there you know
*  nice conversational they are chilled they are universally chilled out but it's a
*  drug oh it's a drug yeah let's don't we're drinking coffee that's a drug this
*  this is a problem is there's a lot of drugs and some of them are really
*  fucking bad for you here's the deal and and I'll call my buddy every now and then
*  that and he was my buddy that bought me the cigar he was a lifelong Copenhagen
*  and cigarettes here and quitting and I called him I'll call him periodically and
*  I'm like you asshole I'm stopping at a grocery I'm stopping at a random cigar
*  shop I've gone four days without a cigar and I'm riding down the road and I
*  determine right now I need one you know you weave across four lanes of traffic
*  find a you know and then next thing you know you're smoking a grocery store I
*  mean a gas station cigar to just but well hey it keeps you keeps you keeps the
*  head clean I like them like I said I think it's one of the best things and I
*  don't think you need to smoke 12 of them a day yeah no I don't think so either
*  but I know people who do I know people just go one to the other there's chain
*  smoke cigars now my mother dude Salem ultralight 100s three packs a day whoa
*  for four Bud lights a day her whole life for Bud every day is she still with us
*  she's with us damn that's the thing that always gets people day they're like
*  maybe I should quit hold on well listen my mom man dude she Joe she she's curved
*  the bit she's curved the beer a little bit but she'll drink her a couple of
*  doles but she's gonna have a one or two Bud lights every day every day she's
*  gonna at three packs my she's but she's like you know it's like if she's walking
*  into the to the Dillards or to the TJ Maxx she's like oh my god I'm walking in
*  take a couple of take a couple and hit you know litter the parking lot but she'll
*  like sure pan fry a rib eye in butter pan fries a rib eye that's probably
*  what's keeping her alive pan fries a rib eye fries some shoestring French fries
*  and that's her damn meal four to five nights a week for 76 glorious years
*  that's probably why she's healthy and is ready to chew my ass out at any moment
*  and how many cigarettes do you think she's down to a day I hope she's
*  probably at a pack and a half but man when you do the math when I used to sit
*  her down and do math you know her and my dad were married 32 years and
*  divorced and so when she went out kind of on her own I'd sit her down and do
*  the math on four Bud lights two and a half packs of salums and four pan-fried
*  rib eyes it becomes a damn number annually I think the rib eyes are fine
*  leave her alone with the you know what but through the years I've gotten
*  Miller Lite endorsements I would get Miller Lite like a I'd be like mama
*  there's a Miller Lite truck pulling up to your house it's gonna deliver you a
*  palette of Miller Lite just try fall in love with Miller Lite right no no Bud
*  Lite I'd get home for you know get home two months after the palette got there
*  you know there the palette sits calling my buddies hey boys a lot of people had
*  like a personal crisis when there was that Bud Lite boycott there was a lot of
*  people like I don't know what to do I don't know what to do when Kid Rock shot
*  that Bud Lite and then he kept selling it in his bar we drank some on the podcast we did together
*  yeah and I love him he's been he's been a damn good buddy of mine and has has
*  come to my charity event he's a wild boy he's awesome I love that dude he's he's
*  he's a lot of fun he's awesome but when I saw him do that I was like
*  Imagine being the CEO of Bud Lite and seeing that like oh no Kid Rock just shot our beer
*  with a fucking automatic and was like fuck Anheuser-Busch like no and I mean
*  that alone probably cost them billions of dollars just having when our beer
*  yeah when our beer when our beer is is political political we're like not just
*  our beer but Bud Lite the Bud Lite the beer that sponsored more boxing matches
*  more sporting events more people been drinking Bud Lite I mean think about all
*  the people swear by Bud Lite Post Malone's always drinking Bud Lite you know my wife's dad is a
*  is a Budweiser fucking 12-pack a day dude man and you know he had to he had to
*  hear a little shit from his buddies about it but people getting fights and
*  bars I have a friend who owned a bar we we stopped carrying at the mothership because nobody was
*  buying it we stopped carrying Bud Lite because nobody was buying Bud Lite have
*  we checked on where it it's come back fully no I don't think so I think there's a bunch of
*  holdouts that are always gonna go fuck those liberals forever but the lady who
*  came up with the idea is gone like the whole the whole marketing team behind
*  they're all gone Anheuser-Busch is an American company that it's employed
*  American people forever it's a great company they just fucked up they get caught up in the
*  mind virus Anheuser-Busch taught us that beer is wonderful for Christmas and Clydesdales and
*  Dalmatians are the equivalent of of Jesus and Christmas remember those Bud
*  Lite guys the real American genius guys yeah American genius they had great commercials dude
*  I would cry over the Dalmatian Clydesdale commercial you remember the little the little
*  puppy yeah he's riding on the Clydesdales find that Jimmy oh shit it's like a friggin
*  hallmark you would never think that that company could get taken down but that just I think that
*  was good it was bad for Bud Lite but I think it was good here it is let's see it we're gonna
*  get all sweet here we go hold on oh the little puppy listen to that music oh a little puppy got
*  out oh poor puppies lost this is for beer yeah poor little puppy wow what a commercial who we
*  need to find oh god wolves they're in Colorado the horses saved the puppy from the wolves have
*  a bud very effective commercial you know real quick you're happy yeah and then there's the
*  one where that it's a Dalmatian too they grew up and then got to the the old Dalmatian and the
*  little you know they're riding the in the young Dalmatian sees the old Dalmatian and I think the
*  old Dalmatian kicks the bucket and then the new Dalmatian takes its place and then you're like
*  oh my god it's the best thing ever yeah well and that company got taken out by having a transgender
*  woman on their cam but it just shows you how prevalent this whole mind virus is that it even
*  got into Bud Lite which is just bizarre but you know the lady who's responsible for it all basically
*  shit on the entire customer base you know saying that they have a fratty sense of humor and we need
*  to update it make it more inclusive and like do you know what you're saying you're alienating all
*  the people that buy it and love it and counting on people who don't buy it and love it to start
*  buying it and loving it and maybe that'll work but you just alienated everybody who buys it love it
*  the dumbest poker move of all time the worst the worst move well you know when you look at country
*  music too I mean with country music I mean it is what it is there's things that it is and you gotta
*  you gotta love on what it is and then you got to grow it too I mean there's there's sensible ways
*  to grow it and but it has to be up to the artists just express themselves honestly and if the artist
*  is a country artist that has a different perspective let that be but leave all the rest of it the way
*  it is too buddy the with every successful music artist that's ever lived it they may have faked
*  you out that any any genre but country is even country's tough because once you show any on
*  on on authenticity yeah buddy you're you're done you're done I could imagine like dude I mean yeah
*  like dude my biggest like when I what man you know I got my thing was tight jeans you wouldn't
*  imagine me wearing tight jeans on stage how much that piss pisses people well it's cuz you're
*  handsome but that's part of the problem good-looking guy up there tight jeans shaking shaking that
*  ass showing that bulge get out of here dude and then I'm like bring back Merle Haggard what the
*  so Joe you know one thing you know my biggest my biggest hurdle ever in my my career and it
*  still breaks my heart to this day I you know back when I my only way to your only way to make it in
*  music is you've got to stop people's eyeballs on you you got to grab them vocally visually
*  musically different you got to get them to stop for two seconds go wait what is that what is that
*  fucker doing right there and when I came out with country girl shake it for me on the on the CMA
*  shaking my ass I mean I had to do it that way in my opinion I had to go this is my moment to show
*  country go shake it for me and I'm the guy that dances and and don't give a damn and let's have
*  some fun and come along for the ride and it was amazing it was amazing you know the fact that I'm
*  a Georgia boy at the time and I was talking to Texas people I was talking to everybody well then
*  at some point a label for me came became bro country did I did because of you yeah well so
*  I heard it and I'm like well bro country well then I started seeing the people making fun of
*  bro country and I'm like this is kind of fucking pissing me off and then and then me and some
*  other artists start getting looped into this bro country phase well I when I was in my form of
*  coming up as an artist and I don't even know we can we don't have to live on this long but you'll
*  be amazed dude so I would go play I made my way by going to Georgia and play in Georgia college
*  towns in the southeast and even I played Auburn a little bit Auburn Alabama and that that school I
*  never I always wanted to break into Auburn and Tuscaloosa because I was always a Georgia artist
*  well I started branching out well dude I'd get done with a college party I'd walk off stage the
*  first thing that would happen is you know three six nine damn she fine give it to me to give it to me
*  one more time get low get low I mean and right when my set got done hip-hop the the the vibe
*  went to a nightclub and I'm standing I'm at the I done walked off stage went to the bar ordered
*  the beer and watched everybody that just let me play Merle Haggard Johnny Cash all the classics
*  my couple of new songs and I was like well man this is nobody's got a fucking problem with this
*  this is we're all together in this good time so when I did country girl shake it for me that made
*  that tie crossover it crying them it made it tie to a little bit yeah and then Jason Aldean had
*  his she's country fucking biggest song when I heard I mean at the time when Jason and I are
*  buddies he does she's country I do country girl shake for me and hit me and him are like we're
*  like this shit our lives are I mean I toured with Jason one year and he broke all of Elvis's
*  indoor records we did it for two years I was the opener and Jason was the headliner and people
*  and and rap was we were playing rap before the show and and everybody was in well then broke
*  country comes along dude I wake up on the bus one morning and I got this interview sitting there
*  drinking my coffee in my fucking underwear and this dude calls me with hits magazine and he goes
*  well Luke you know man this broke country thing and I said well hold up buddy here's what this is
*  and I said and man I did this and I made one fatal error and at the time Joe no one hated my
*  ass I believe that I mean I did because I was coming to Billy Bob's playing in well I had Texas
*  I had the I had though I had oh yeah I'd go to I'd go to Bozeman Montana and play country girl
*  shake it for me I'd go to everywhere well and I said man I don't know how to be an outlaw I'm not
*  an outlaw that ain't I'm a I'm a college dude that played frat parties country music I play I was
*  like I fucking did not go sit in a prison cell right like Merle Haggard and write songs about
*  guys going to death row and I didn't go to Folsom prison and man I listed all the I was like I'm not
*  like Willie Nelson I don't do Willie Nelson they're outlaws and I said if it's broke country and
*  that's what I'm labeled as I said and where I fucked up as I said I haven't well I haven't
*  spent the night like sleeping on the street and I didn't say like Johnny Cash's song Sunday
*  Morning Coming Down that's what I meant I just didn't tie it well that dude took that article
*  and said Luke Bryan says outlaw country people are they basically drug addicts that sleep in
*  the street and man I pissed that whole that the way they manipulated that story I lost that whole
*  crowd right there why broke my heart and wait like I think Waylon Jennings daughter went real
*  public would be in I mean she's fucking mad at my ass and dude she went on there going you know
*  Luke my dad never laid and I never meant that I just meant yeah Waylon was in there too but we
*  all know what all those guys are because we got to watch all the documentaries about those guys and
*  we got to be students of those guys that's the problem with interviews is first of all they're
*  trying to get you what your interviews are the beauty well and you know one's no one's gotten
*  pop more than you because they'll take our man I hope we sit here and bullshit for three hours
*  but they'll take your five minutes right out of context and now they'll AI you so well the so what
*  happened man that thing started growing and man I had motorcycle gangs wanting to burn my house down
*  I had when you get misrepresented in that type of deal and then the the subcategories of articles
*  then the article of the article of the article what year was this man I don't know we I don't it
*  was probably 2012 or 13 so this was when social this was that was not as impactful it was becoming
*  was YouTube even around them yes and clickbait the world of clickbait was was getting just start
*  getting rocking right and but what so what I did is man I called Waylon Jennings daughter and said
*  I said ma'am I just forgot to say like this like the Chris Christopherson song Sunday morning coming
*  down that's all I meant by that and I think she accepted I called what I text Willie he sent me
*  the best reply he goes he goes it's okay to step on your dick just don't stand on it I called
*  Jesse Waylon I called Jesse Colter and she goes Luke what did you mean in the interview and I
*  told her and she goes Waylon stopped doing print interview and and it was and then but by then the
*  the the narrative started and since then I can all I can always tell that if that one little thing
*  I probably would have kept that whole base and then the oh my god he wears tight jeans and he
*  must you know he must homosexual on the side you know as I'm as I'm posing with my you know
*  my all-american family I think it's probably a thing also they think Hollywood has invaded
*  country music which is always a big threat because there's so much money in country music that they
*  think these Hollywood executives that don't understand or appreciate real country are gonna
*  come in and make something inauthentic so then they hear you saying that get misrepresented and
*  then they take it as a part of all that right Joe laugh so my album came out I put a worked on
*  an album for three years it's called mind of a country boy and I put it out like first of
*  October and I didn't want to put the damn album out because the reality is this I'm not at the
*  height when every artist hits their peak every you know it I mean I sold out I was selling out
*  football stadiums first day three or four years I did it I know that's my peak probably I know it
*  is fuck I'm not gonna even say probably I'm a realist well so we put the album out and I said
*  you know what the albums no album sale nothing sells anymore so I knew there was gonna be a
*  negative take on the album I knew something negative would come by me putting the album
*  out based on it may not sell and it sold what it did it didn't do it did what I thought it'd do
*  as me being the artists where I'm at my life I've seen this world of streaming right nothing's
*  buying nothing's buying well dude I did 2040 I did 40 hours of 40 hours of you know all the
*  stuff the what's happened is because of online advertising being the primary source of income
*  for news they have to do clickbait shit they have to distort things and then they have editors that
*  don't give a shit about anything other than the bottom line so you get a writer even if the writers
*  a good person I've had writers that I know have written about people that I know and they told
*  me that their editor came in and changed things they're told me they told me their editors because
*  the editor's ass is about to get canned yeah exactly because they his company just got
*  bought by big conglomerate exactly that that's why artists should just stay away from that shit
*  well and I you do and I knew it what sucks yeah is dude you know you know it you know when you're
*  getting baited yeah you can see it coming a mile away you have to film everything you do every
*  conversation you have with someone you should film them all so that no one could take you out of
*  context and then if anything goes wrong so that guy's full of shit this is what I said I did and
*  then I did even make a video I did and those people should be shamed it's a terror it's a terrible
*  evil ugly thing you do you crush people's perspective you change how the world looks at people just for
*  clickbait and it could it could genuinely affect someone's life and listen you know the deal I mean
*  I grew up in South Georgia and you know we've raised our dang kids like colorblind it's so
*  awesome so proud of their colorblindness isn't it funny that that is a negative thing to say today
*  that people don't like that I just say something negative yeah there's a lot of people that don't
*  think you should be colorblind they think you that that's a lie say I don't think that way that was
*  what we were all working towards until about 2012 have you ever seen like the numbers I'm
*  sending this Jamie because this is what people need to understand a lot of what we're all
*  experiencing is manipulation and a lot of this manipulation might not even be from our own
*  country a lot of this manipulation is what happens when you have foreign entities that are
*  manipulating people oh yeah that's it thank you look at that Jamie you're the best yearly
*  mentions of prejudice and popular US news media outlets now look at what happens look at this
*  crazy spike so you have everything from 1970 until you have like 1990 see what's going on in 1990
*  between 80 and 90 you have cable okay so now you have people that need more eyes on their shit so
*  you have Fox News you have a lot of this you have people get a little bit more jazzed up look at
*  transphobia you never even heard what the fuck that was until 2010 look look how it just jumps
*  up in 2020 in 1990 didn't exist 1980 didn't exist Islamophobia same deal anti-semitism scroll all
*  the way up to the top though Jamie so look at racism racism is essentially fairly steady until
*  around 2012 and then it goes on this wild ramp straight up the New York Times from 2010 to 2020
*  it goes up 712% Los Angeles Times 756% it just skyrockets all the mention of racism why because
*  no one wants racism no one wants to be racist everyone's scared of being called racist and all
*  the race hustlers love to call people racist so it becomes a commodity so people start trading
*  in racism and this idea that you shouldn't be colorblind and then you should recognize race you
*  should recognize color and stop we were on a we were on a good path to Martin Luther King said
*  judging people but based on the content of their character we were on that path and social media
*  and manipulation fucked us and hopefully we realize what happened now and I think there'll
*  be a downward trend and people sort of like wake up and I think that is that's one thing that is
*  balancing out right now with the internet is enough people realize they've been manipulated
*  so starting to like calm down a lot of woke shit started to die off as people are coming to their
*  senses like everybody's woke up from a fever dream but as far as your situation and dealing
*  with the media don't oh I just don't yeah you're so dang you know the deal you're naive a little
*  naive because you're a nice guy but it's because you're a good person that's why you're naive
*  you assume what's amazing is when I'm at on American Isle that desk and I've been doing it
*  for nine damn years and I have cried with everybody when those kids come in they are
*  everybody walking through that door is a microcosm of America and man I've sat there and loved and
*  learned do you enjoy doing that like seeing new talent pop up nothing is more amazing than watching
*  a broken kid with with with that's been told they're not good and they come from everywhere
*  they it could be the man then the craziest thing is the is the is the kids that were raised in the
*  doctors that the doctor family can't wrap their head around my child wanting to go try this fucking
*  music thing what well you're you're doctors we're doctors and man when they branch out and the
*  family gets behind them and then they go and follow their dreams and man it's really yeah it
*  doesn't get old I mean listen I mean it's a fun chair to be in it's a fun chair to be in because
*  that door opens and it's a it's a life that comes in and you don't know what the hell you know we
*  have a note or two like you know just lost their father to cancer three months ago you know from
*  a small town but other than that man we don't know what they're gonna do and how they're gonna
*  react and it's pretty cool I mean you know when and and when I just moved to Nashville when American
*  was just I mean 40 million viewers a week and the you know the the tone in Nashville is that's the
*  cheap route to get famous because I came up through you got to play a thousand nightclubs you got to
*  go you got to go through you got to meet the record labels you got to do the radio you got to go meet
*  everybody at radio so with the whole town of Nashville was like what's not totally fair that
*  just pop on TV and and and sir you know and skip all the but now I mean now now that's gone which
*  is great well here's an example Oliver Anthony totally Oliver Anthony has one song he releases
*  it's the most pull up that song because this fucking song this dude when I heard it it's just
*  a camera and him with his guitar when I heard it I was like holy shit that's fucking amazing
*  and holy shit that guy better have some songs to come behind it yeah well he's a talented motherfucker
*  he is I mean I'm very very bright man it's what life shit listen to that
*  damn shame listen to that this dude was selling equipment he'd never even done a concert first
*  concert he does is like 18,000 people at a state fair and he's as genuine as you had him on here
*  correct I had him on here and I actually gave him advice how did he do he did great because I gave
*  him advice before I met him because he was in the middle of all this and he goes hey man he goes can
*  I talk to you so we talked on the phone I'm like what's up he's like man I'm getting all these
*  offers from all these people they want to buy this and buy that and they want to give me seven
*  million dollars if I do this and sign that I said stay independent I go you have talent everyone
*  saying I have to act now I go fuck those people I go you don't have to act now that's famine
*  thinking I go you're talented man that I had heard a couple of his other songs as well he's
*  fucking talented and he's genuine and I go you can't fake that just stick stick stay independent
*  man because they're not gonna offer you anything those people are just gonna they're the reason
*  why they want to give you a lot of money is because they're gonna make way more than they're
*  gonna give you that's the only reason why they want to give you money they want a piece of you
*  before you become one of the biggest stars in the world and then they own a chunk of you forever
*  because they gave you seven million dollars we didn't have any money I go just bank on yourself
*  yeah and got you know the beauty of idol is is and guys like this there's so many avenues now you
*  can go the old-fashioned route you can go the quick route you can go the idol route you can go
*  stream on you know you can go video yourself on all your social platforms and the right song can
*  blow you up but then and then you got to go do the real work you got to do the next one we tell the
*  kids other other bullets in your chamber that's what we tell the kids on idle now I think when
*  Idol was really really obviously when Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood won and even people
*  after that they went they still they went their ass to work too and it's an insane opportunity
*  it's insane yeah and you know these kids on Idol now they love seeing their their social media
*  platforms go up a thousand percent and it's worth it and you know we you know and and there's gonna
*  be bumps in the road and it's you know it's still you know it's still you know there's gonna be a
*  you know a group of people saying you know American Idol may exploit these kids man I'm
*  in the back I'm behind the scenes on everything and man we we won't you know they won't when we
*  get a kid that we love man we sit around we go to dinner and we talk about that kid and love them
*  and these I think you know these kids leave it going man that was a great experience for them
*  I hope so but you know I'm sure they do and it is an insane opportunity if you want to be a
*  professional musician and you want to make a career out of it it's one of the most unbelievable
*  moments you got to do your path yeah you got my path was my path and it was unique to mine and
*  because yours is different that don't mean I need to hate you for it there's a lot of that shit with
*  today too oh cuz a comedian will have one clip or he's doing some crowd work or one clip of one
*  bit that everybody loves then all of a sudden he's selling out and everybody's like that guy he only
*  had one good job he's only been around for three years but so what he let him run with it let him
*  run with it you know it's it's we're living in a new world it's like the song it is a new world
*  why wouldn't we all want someone else to win right what is wrong what's wrong with people
*  winning it's like you have figured out how to feed yourself with a guitar yeah you figured out
*  how to tell jokes yeah and make a living and and you know all like man like I said dude I won't
*  even post my damn dear I killed cuz I don't want to I don't want to get online and be there
*  with a glass of wine at 3 a.m. and start motherfucking like dude I want to kill them
*  yeah like I said you get over it you get over it but man it pisses you off I don't read anything
*  I tell everybody don't read anything don't read anything about you just don't don't read the good
*  stuff don't read the bad stuff I do good with it and I mean hell I mean I'm sitting out a 48
*  year old man my shits in the bank but it still makes you mad it still makes you mad it doesn't
*  matter even if you're undeniable it doesn't matter it's a human it's a human instinct to
*  read negative things get upset because humans always had to worry about threats and if the
*  threats were other tribes or predators or whatever you had to attack that so we're always
*  we're mentally conditioned to look for what is a fighter fighter flight yeah well it's also it's
*  like if you have a hundred people who love you but one that hates you that one is the one you're
*  gonna think about you're not gonna think all the people that think they say you're awesome you
*  think about that one that hates you and then you have to think about the kind of people that post
*  comments most of the people who post comments are miserable people not positive comments but the
*  negative comments I started a thing you know and I know you got people in your world where man you
*  know there's assholes and you'll huddle up and you'll spend an hour talking about how you can't
*  believe how big an asshole that person is yeah and I'm like guys we're 15 minutes in on talking
*  about this person being an asshole 15 minutes 15 minutes on us trying to figure out yeah why
*  can't they stop being an asshole you basically wasted one one hundredth of your day on somebody
*  that sucks you only get a hundred of those 15 minutes in a day you wasted one talking about
*  a shithead it's a mess but it's a normal thing that people do you just got to not do it you got
*  to realize this is a new world when I see when I see other buddies doing it I'm like whoa whoa whoa
*  out of there yeah man I recognized it when I was on television before social media there was a
*  thing called the there was these Hollywood magazines like variety and the Hollywood reporter and I
*  would always call them the devil's rag because I would get to the set of the TV show and everybody
*  was reading the devil's rag they were like oh I can't believe they're number two we should be
*  we should be right after friends oh they were everybody was upset and I was like you guys are
*  I'm on TV I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you people I'm on television I can't believe I'm
*  on TV you guys are upset that we're number 30 instead of number two or whatever the fuck it is
*  can't we just appreciate the fact that this is back when there was only like five networks can't
*  we appreciate the fact that we're one of the luckiest human beings that have ever lived we're on a
*  fucking television show and yet you're reading these magazines and it's like is it Thomas
*  Jefferson who wrote that quote comparison is a thief of joy but whoever was that was it Jefferson
*  I know we know who we've read it before but that quote is so accurate comparison it's that's why
*  billionaires I I know a dude is worth like a billion and a half dollars and he thinks he's
*  broke because he's friends with like Jeff Bezos I do not get into that you cannot get into that
*  world there you can't win you can't win because you're in a crazy fucking numbers race and it
*  doesn't mean anything you're not even enjoying what you have so my wife for her 40th birthday
*  man I surprised her and I rented her never done anything we went rented like a hundred twenty
*  foot boat and took all our college friends down to st. Bart's for New Year's have you ever heard
*  of this scene no is it crazy Joe so first of all I mean this boat that we got is a 120 foot Westport
*  beautiful we get the same but I didn't know what the fuck we were doing oh you're in the yacht
*  world okay so you're entering into these worlds of 200 foot boats 250 the oligarchs yeah okay yeah
*  I've seen that and it's in st. Bart's and they all they all float there for New Year's uh-huh and
*  it's all dick measuring contest dude and my captain of that little boat which that boat looked
*  like our boat that we were on looked like their shuttle boats right and I my captain I said did
*  you ever pilot one of those he goes oh yeah he goes I said what what that what were they doing
*  on there he goes looking at the other boats wondering I said that dude is on a fucking
*  billion dollar yacht and pissed at the other billion dollar yacht yeah that's real they're
*  all in competition with each other and they're all hating you know and and I'm entering in yeah you
*  just got to get your little world like my little world now my little Tennessee hunting world I
*  tell people all the time they're like come on down to my ranch oh man I got I got my little deal
*  yeah it's enough stay sane keep it tight what are they doing on that boat cat in that nuts
*  imagine being a 250 foot yacht looking at the dude on the 300 foot yacht going god damn it I
*  got to upgrade I was talking to a dude who pilots yachts and he was telling me that they they always
*  want to sell them they always want to sell them and get another one he goes all these yachts are
*  always almost for sale I go how come he goes because they're always want another yacht they
*  always want a bigger yacht it's a trap it's a giant trap imagine having all that money you're
*  not even appreciating it because you're worried about making more remember we were kids if you
*  said do like what would you do if you had a million dollars but never work again I'd fucking
*  just well you know I remember dreaming did you lay in bed and just be like I remember dreaming
*  about trying to do it and how I was gonna go you're gonna get rich how am I gonna get I
*  wouldn't say rich how am I gonna be able to have my own little my own bass pond right because I
*  would have to call other people and get permission right and that did the anxiety of calling old
*  farmer right going hey you know farmer John said can I go fish your bass lake I don't know Luke
*  not today and so I remember doing that and then when you start achieving it man I still I mean I
*  don't I don't think it's I don't think I'm living in that world of like the other right digging you
*  know I think you can for a minute yeah I think it can I think you can for a little bit like it's
*  a trap it is a trap and the problem is it's all numbers no it's like you know dudes are crazy
*  with deer like I want a 200 inch deal 200 inch I want a 400 inch elk they get crazy with numbers
*  you know I talked this dude who worked on a ranch and they have big elk on this ranch and he said
*  sometimes the countries are really happy with an elk and then they'll put a tape to it measure it
*  and it's 396 and they get bummed out because it's not 400 I'm like those people are sick you should
*  never have them here again you should boyk ban them they should never be allowed to be here again
*  that's a sickness but that's what happens with these people with everything man I never had a
*  dream of being wealthy it was never a dream it was never even an never even in my imagination
*  did I ever think I was gonna be rich I never even thought about it I when I started doing stand-up
*  comedy my dream was to be a professional because I always had jobs my dream was to be able to pay
*  my bills with comedy I looked at all that was yeah that was now my dream yeah let me make sure
*  I didn't steer you wrong on that my dream was to to do these things out of being driven like right
*  enough I mean when I moved to Nashville I wrote on a chalkboard write a number one song you know
*  when a when a CMA award you know I had a little vision board nice but I didn't understand I
*  didn't really comprehend the money after that because I didn't know it and I didn't know like
*  like people are like I'm a big Georgia Bulldog fan and they're like did you go to Georgia and
*  I'm like buddy me going to the University of Georgia when I was 18 years old I mean I barely
*  my dad barely got the money for me to go to the community college 12 minutes down the road so
*  going to Georgia didn't wasn't even I didn't even put it in there right so go ahead well I'm just
*  saying that when I see people that that's all they care about is the money and then they're
*  always thinking about the richness and the money I just think it's a trap and it the problem is if
*  you're always comparing yourself to other people you're not gonna enjoy what you have you know
*  enjoy this experience temporary experience of life right you know because it is temporary it's so
*  quick I'm 57 years old how the fuck did that happen all of a sudden you just keep getting
*  older and then you know one day you're dead and I bet on your deathbed you're like how did it
*  happen so quick how did it happen so quick what are you doing with your time and are you enjoying
*  it and I think you need things outside of what you do that you love and like for you and I I think
*  it's hunting and got in the out there because I think it balances you I think there's something
*  very spiritual about it I think there's something just being in the woods is it's a very spiritual
*  experience like a real spiritual experience like there I think it's like a vitamin that you don't
*  know you need until you get it and when you get it you feel better when I'm out there I feel better
*  I just feel better I'm like the air is cleaner I feel more in touch with being alive it just feels
*  better and I think I'm not thinking about anything else when I'm if I'm elk hunting I'm not thinking
*  about jokes and I'm not thinking about podcast guests I'm not thinking about jack shit I'm just
*  thinking about what I'm doing that's it it's and it's it's very difficult to do and it's it's you
*  have to really focus and you're thinking about it you always trying to improve and this that
*  alone is good for your brain it's good for you know I lost you know I lost my brother and my sister
*  and my sister's husband passed away and man when and then yes I lost my brother at 26 my sister at
*  39 and her husband died at 45 and man it is present the daily appreciation of this deal
*  yes visually present isn't that crazy about people though it's like they almost need to lose something
*  to be able to appreciate what you have well and I tell people man you know you you meet I tell people
*  man really be careful because if you make it to 80 you're gonna get you're gonna get popped with
*  something I don't think you can get through this thing like some kind of a disease or something no
*  no I don't what I'm saying you're gonna lose something you're gonna lose something dear you're
*  not gonna get through a to Z without really a hard a hard loss no that's and it's a part of life
*  and but some people man they're just delusional and then a lot of people are medicated too so that
*  they don't even know what the fuck is going on while they're living this life they're living
*  this life under the influence of the pharmaceutical drug companies and they're just floating through
*  life in a haze and they don't even know what's happening while it's happening and then they get
*  to the end and then what'd you do what'd you do did you help people did you make people feel
*  better did you inspire people did you enrich people's lives what'd you do you know and then
*  then you have to realize like god damn I waste a lot of time reading comments thank you thank you
*  for doing this a lot of time get mad at I don't do it bad that's what's funny everybody says
*  they don't look at their phone let me see you screen time six hours Jesus bitch oh
*  yeah man I mean well we're all this is a new world too in terms of that I keep saying this
*  is a new world but this really is a new element to our lives is this social media element and
*  I think there's not a lot of stuff that's written on it where people understand yeah we're learning
*  yeah we're the lab rats we really are especially our kids our kids really are the lab rats that
*  we the kids really are and not just that also access to violence they see so much violence
*  they see so much online that's horrible think about I think about this all the time I would
*  go stay with a buddy at his house and he go man I rented faces of death remember those I
*  wouldn't watch them I'd be like man my parents told me not to watch that he go what you don't
*  watch this guy get electrocuted and I'm like fuck no I don't want to watch a dude get electrocuted
*  we're watching people we're watching people there it's yeah if you're on Instagram you're
*  seeing people dying every every day every day I have friends breaking oh yeah I mean I remember
*  Joe Thiesman when Joe Thiesman broke his leg dude it's like shut the country down yeah I know now
*  it's like that's nothing I watched a dude on a diving board and his foot fell in a crack in
*  the dive dive more had an opening in it and he went forward and his knee stayed in the same place
*  and just snapped his leg the wrong way and he's screaming hanging from a broken leg that's just
*  one thing I saw today I thought you don't do that I watched things on Instagram I just don't read
*  comments but me and Tom Segura we send each other the most horrible shit every day it's
*  ridiculous but some days that he sends me things I don't even look at them I'm like no I can see
*  it coming but I do love I do love the funny comical aspect of it that gives me and a cup
*  of coffee dying laughing at some person being a goofball or memes oh some memes they got us
*  yeah memes are some of the best comedy out there and it's just random people create these funny
*  things there's a lot of funny people what's amazing is we've gotten to where we can see
*  the meme happen and predict the meme and the means on your phone yeah the next day and you're like
*  within hours oh yeah they're so quick and memes are weird because a lot of times you don't even
*  know who made it you're sharing it somebody sends it to you you send it to other people like who
*  got who made that who's the wizard that figured this out it's fucking hilarious like a meme
*  factory well it's like jokes remember jokes like you know two guys walking to a bar those jokes
*  who fucking wrote those we don't know but some of them were bangers and they spread they just
*  spread spread across the whole country but somebody had to be the guy that sat down and
*  tells the story two guys walking to a bar and then you know you know it's everywhere well I mean
*  there's a million places we can go but it's you know you look at yeah I mean the damn children
*  my kids I mean we're yelling at them every day get up get off the phone yeah get outside and they
*  do a good job but man I think it's just it's a part of that's part of their deal they're being
*  influenced by things far beyond our control you know way different than anything that any other
*  generation has ever experienced before like my son he's a 16 year old quarterback and man he
*  watches all these other quarterbacks on on you know hell there are 14 recruiting download sites
*  from that that and my son's like that dude right there is the greatest quarterback in the country
*  I said well how old is he Bo? He's 15 dad I'm like Bo we don't know what that little shit's
*  gonna be what are you talking about he goes well dad he's a five star and he's 15 I'm like Bo your
*  dad when I moved in Nashville I was a one-star country singer if I'd had a rating next to me
*  and probability of me making it yeah I wouldn't it would have been a one star I worked myself into
*  hopefully a three star three star recruit and he's looking me like I'm crazy and so one of those kids
*  he played him now my son's not starting he's back up quarterback to a great quarterback and we played
*  him and we beat him we get down he gets home after the game I said what'd you think about
*  your your little savior there he goes he's still the greatest quarterback of all time I said Bo he
*  lost the fucking game he's 15 just son let it let's let life happen before we anoint yeah you know
*  be inspired be inspired by other success but don't take it too seriously and also recognize
*  that kid might start getting laid and throw it all away exactly he ran he don't know what's gonna
*  yeah you're 15 you know what the fuck's coming your way you don't know one yeah yeah you're
*  running some Russian chicken English class yeah some new Russian exchange student that needs a
*  it needs an English tutor yeah all of a sudden you don't have any sperm left in your body you're
*  dehydrated all day long yeah you're you're getting the lecture lights on the sideline and you're not
*  doing any offseason running or lifting you're busy also people just they lose the focus you
*  know and sometimes they get pushed too hard by the parents there's a little bit of that too the
*  kids rebel they don't want to do it anymore anything can happen but that's what's fascinating
*  about life is that it's all open your daughters are how old now 28 16 and 14 yeah the 16 and 14
*  the 16 and 14 are going through a totally different experience the girls are all girls the
*  girls are girls are way I mean I just they're way more in my heart my heart aches for for girls in
*  this in this well there's a there's some alarming statistics about the growth of social media from
*  like 2009 where you see girls with self-harm all sorts of psychological conditions online bullying
*  because girls are fucking vicious to each other online boys will run into each other and punch
*  each other in the face yeah but girls will attack each other's character and they'll have their
*  reputation destroyers and they love to like make up stories about girls and be mean about girls and
*  talk shit about the way girls look and the way girls dress and the guys girls are dating and they
*  do it to each other and it's just it's unfortunate but it's that's what gossip used to be gossip
*  used to just be talking though it's like a normal thing where girls get around and talk but now they
*  talk online and when they talk online then other people read like and you're ruining people's
*  lives you're ruining little girls lives and suicide is off the charts and self-harm is off
*  the charts and you know the young girls are getting affected when you have when when I have
*  my 14 year old go dad I'm anxious about this I'm like I didn't know the word anxious right I didn't
*  know the word anxious until I was 35 years old right right right it wasn't thought when we were
*  kids in high school it wasn't processed as anxiety it was processed as like life yeah I'm getting
*  nervous yeah yeah yeah I got a big test my stomach hurts I gotta go take a shit right right right
*  now it's the thing they think about all the time and the problem with that is Abigail Schreier
*  wrote a book about this you focus on your problems your problems oftentimes become bigger when you
*  think about things like anxiety guess what makes you more anxious so it doesn't help it it actually
*  has the opposite effect yeah it's a weird world but they're gonna be okay we're all gonna be okay
*  we're just gonna have to adjust and figure it out on the fly it's just this this adjustment is bigger
*  than any adjustment than any generations ever had to make before but it's also like look at
*  things like Oliver Anthony good comes out of it too yeah you know jelly roll jelly roll Jesus
