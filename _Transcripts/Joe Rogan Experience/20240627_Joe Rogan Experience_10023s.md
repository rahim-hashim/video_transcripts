# JRE MMA Show #131 with Mighty Mouse
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening my friend? Good to see you. Good to see you too. Good to see you thriving out there in the world. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=10.0s)]
*  Just trying to do my best. Dude, you're killing it. It's beautiful. Beautiful. That comeback win was fucking fantastic. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=18.0s)]
*  Thanks man. It was great to see. Thank you. How the fuck are you still so good? You haven't slipped at all. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=23.0s)]
*  Uh, honestly I think it's just the training. My mindset, the team around me, and just honestly trying to get better every single time I step into cage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=29.0s)]
*  The lighter weight classes though, I've always felt like there's a short window of excellence. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=40.0s)]
*  You know, like even in boxing it seems like it's like nine, ten years at peak form. But you defy that. You know, you really do man. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=45.0s)]
*  You're still like as good as ever. It could be because I'm black. I'll give you my genetics. I have no idea. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=54.0s)]
*  It can't just be that. There's a lot of people that are also black that haven't been able to do that. Yeah, that's true. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=61.0s)]
*  I think what you're saying is it's also technique. Your technique has always been paramount. You know, it's always like the forefront of everything. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=67.0s)]
*  Honestly, I believe it's probably just my upbringing in mixed martial arts. Right? And even, you know, I was talking to people the other day and I said I started when I was 18, like in martial arts. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=74.0s)]
*  If you count, some people don't count wrestling as a martial arts. Oh, you should. Right? I do. Yeah, I do. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=84.0s)]
*  So I started in middle school and then once I got out of high school, I didn't go to college to wrestle. I jumped right into mixed martial arts. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=90.0s)]
*  So I think, you know, Matt, he made me do one fight at MMA. Then the next fight was boxing, mixed martial arts. They kicked boxing back to MMA, shoot boxing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=97.0s)]
*  And then he was like, hey, you got to do this grappling tournament and you need to submit everybody. Don't come back if you don't. Right? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=110.0s)]
*  So, you know, he's a hard man. Yeah. And, you know, at the time when he was doing that, I didn't know what he was prepping me for. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=115.0s)]
*  Right. I honestly didn't like I was working full time and I was still an amateur, but I would do these these things he told me to do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=125.0s)]
*  And then now when I get into my fights or when I do things, I'm able to, you know, go back to my beginning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=133.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, I faced this before and I'm able to just keep keep getting better. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=142.0s)]
*  My foundation is so solid that that's what's been able to keep me on top for so long. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=147.0s)]
*  Well, I think that really helped you in that mixed fight with Rod Tang. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=152.0s)]
*  Yeah. Because that that was a wild proposition. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=156.0s)]
*  I was like, whoa, this is going to be interesting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=160.0s)]
*  And props to him for taking that because he had to know after round one. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=163.0s)]
*  I wasn't getting that ass. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=168.0s)]
*  Well, so when they offered that to me, I was like I was on the couch of the wife. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=170.0s)]
*  Which explained to everybody what the rules were. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=175.0s)]
*  Yeah. So the rules were the first round. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=177.0s)]
*  So if you guys don't know who Rod Tang is, he's one of the best, probably the best Muay Thai fighters in the world. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=180.0s)]
*  People put him at pound for pound. He's a fucking he just walks these people like he's a beast. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=187.0s)]
*  So the first round was Muay Thai. I could not grapple. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=192.0s)]
*  I could not, you know. Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=197.0s)]
*  So right here when they when he broke me up, I was trying to lock him up like a body lock. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=199.0s)]
*  I could take down. Was it a three minute round or five minute round? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=205.0s)]
*  Three minute round. Right. And so the first round was Muay Thai and the second round was MMA. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=208.0s)]
*  Fourth round is going to be third round to be Muay Thai. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=213.0s)]
*  And the fourth round was MMA. So I knew the first round was going to be, you know, very difficult. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=216.0s)]
*  But right there, as you see, I'm trying to hold him. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=222.0s)]
*  I can't like I literally was over my hands and not trying to grab him as I would if it was MMA. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=225.0s)]
*  Were you allowed to clinch? Because Muay Thai involves a lot of clinch work. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=230.0s)]
*  What was the rules there? So you are a lot of clinch. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=234.0s)]
*  But if you watch any of the Muay Thai in one championship, they don't actually I feel they don't give the athletes [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=237.0s)]
*  enough time to actually fight and dominate in the clinch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=242.0s)]
*  I feel the same way because I was watching Rod Tang's last fight and they break them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=245.0s)]
*  They break them immediately. I'm like, stop. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=249.0s)]
*  Like, why do you think they do that? I don't know. I don't. I don't know. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=251.0s)]
*  They're trying to make it more action packed, more action packed and push it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=254.0s)]
*  They push it. Just just the action. Right. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=258.0s)]
*  But for me, I feel like in Muay Thai, if somebody can be very dominant in the clinch, then that's that's part of this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=262.0s)]
*  That's part of the sport. Right. How dangerous did you feel him in the first round? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=267.0s)]
*  Um, he I think the last time I got rocked in any of my fights was probably John Dotson. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=271.0s)]
*  And he gave me that same feeling again. So but it was fun. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=277.0s)]
*  It was fun just exchanging with them. And I think, you know, having this fight was good for my career and good for my confidence. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=284.0s)]
*  And, you know, to come off a loss against, you know, Adriano and then come back and fight another tough striker, striker, it was just right there. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=291.0s)]
*  You see how I'm like this? Oh, yeah. Right. You can't. I can't. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=300.0s)]
*  Like I didn't want to like right there. I would have blown through fucking double leg or I would have done a knee tap. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=303.0s)]
*  So that was the hardest thing. And then, you know, there's a point in time where like. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=308.0s)]
*  But you stayed competitive with them. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=312.0s)]
*  You know, even though the first round was clearly the round that he wanted to turn on the gas because he's you know, that's his world. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=314.0s)]
*  Yeah. And well, the game plan was to, you know, avoid and not take damage. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=322.0s)]
*  But I told I told Matt I was like, dog, I was like, I didn't come here to Singapore to get yellow card like they're not taking 10 percent of my purse. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=326.0s)]
*  And I said, if they tell me action and they're like, I'm going to warn you. I'm going to look at you and I'm a wink. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=333.0s)]
*  I go, it's been a good ride. I'm just going to go. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=338.0s)]
*  So this is where he hit me in the first. I was like, fuck this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=341.0s)]
*  We're going. I'm just going to fight. And if I get knocked out, get knocked out. If I don't, then, hey, we got the second round. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=344.0s)]
*  So you definitely tagged him a bunch. Oh, yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=349.0s)]
*  You know, you you made it a very competitive like right there. One, two. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=351.0s)]
*  But that motherfucker can take a shot like nobody. It's weird. Yep. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=354.0s)]
*  He stands there and lets guys punch him in the face. Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=359.0s)]
*  Who the fuck does that at an elite level other than like Anderson in his prime? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=361.0s)]
*  I think the last person I hit that hard was Ali Bogatinoff. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=365.0s)]
*  Like I remember I was fighting him and I remember kneeing him in the jaw and feeling his jaw shift in the fight. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=369.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not going to knock you out. Like I'm going to destroy my body before I knock you out. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=375.0s)]
*  And I remember going home. My knees were the size of grapefruits from just hitting him so much. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=379.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, Ali was on the sauce, too. Well, yeah, too. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=385.0s)]
*  But yeah, that was the last time I fought someone else. Like, holy shit, you can take a beating. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=387.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was he? He got popped for EPO, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=392.0s)]
*  It was EPO. Yep. Yeah. EPO. I remember my father-in-law, he was back there with me. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=394.0s)]
*  I did my drug test and I walked, walked past Ali. He was sitting there drinking water. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=399.0s)]
*  I take his drug test and my father-in-law goes, I'm telling you right now, no man could take a beating like that and be able to walk away. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=404.0s)]
*  There's something, something that right here. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=411.0s)]
*  And then sure enough, I'm at home playing video games. Earl Hauwani was like, hey, did you hear the news? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=413.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, you're bothering me right now. What do you want? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=417.0s)]
*  He goes, he popped for EPO. And I was like, and? Like, I don't give a shit. I'm playing games. Bye. And beep. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=419.0s)]
*  So, but hey, it is, it is, it is in the past. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=424.0s)]
*  He was good though. He was good. He was strong. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=428.0s)]
*  But it makes sense that he was on EPO because his cardio was off the charts. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=431.0s)]
*  That's, that was the biggest thing we saw in breaking him down in a fight is that if we put the pressure on him, eventually he's going to break like he has in his other fights. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=435.0s)]
*  And then when he didn't, you know, we're like, huh, he's still here. You know, good thing we're prepared, but he shouldn't be here right now. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=444.0s)]
*  But he was. Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=450.0s)]
*  So this Rod Tang fight, one of the things that's very interesting about 1FC is how they're just really mixing everything up. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=452.0s)]
*  They've got grappling matches, you know, Mikey Musa Meche's over there competing, Gary Tonan, the Rotolo brothers. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=460.0s)]
*  It's like, it's very wild what they're doing. They have Muay Thai matches, kickboxing matches. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=466.0s)]
*  That one boxing match, which was for WBC title. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=472.0s)]
*  So, oh yeah, it was boxing gloves, boxing gloves, full blown boxing. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=476.0s)]
*  Like it was a world, a world title fight. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=480.0s)]
*  That's one of the things I love about 1 Championship is that they're mixing it up. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=483.0s)]
*  Right. So when I got the opportunity to go over there and compete, like I knew I had the opportunity to do something fun like I did with Rod Tang. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=487.0s)]
*  Now, was it difficult to make that decision to leave the UFC? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=493.0s)]
*  Because you were, you know, coming off of a very close, controversial loss to Henry Sahudo. Very close fight. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=505.0s)]
*  You know, it was like mostly the wrestlings, a couple takedowns that he got. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=506.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a couple takedowns. And I think I relied too much on the leg kicks. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=510.0s)]
*  Like I, like in that fight, I couldn't get him down to the ground. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=513.0s)]
*  The striking scene on the feet, like with the hands, it seemed like it was pretty even. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=516.0s)]
*  I was, I think I outlanded him. Like when you look at the strike, strike copy box strike numbers. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=520.0s)]
*  But I felt like I relied too much on the leg kicks because I was, I was fucking tearing those legs up. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=525.0s)]
*  Well, you hurt his leg real bad in that first round. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=529.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=532.0s)]
*  He got that drop foot thing going on. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=533.0s)]
*  Yep, yep. He had the drop thing going on. But I was like, I couldn't get there with the hands, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=534.0s)]
*  I couldn't knock him out with the hands. So I was like, you know, I'm going to tear your leg up. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=538.0s)]
*  Kept on tearing the leg up. And when the fight ended and I was like, ah, he probably got it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=542.0s)]
*  I was like, he, he, he beat me. And then they read the scorecard and I was like, huh, it is what it is. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=547.0s)]
*  Like, what are you going to do? So when I was the decision after that, like, what was it like? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=551.0s)]
*  So it was frustrating. But then, you know, at the time I was like, I wonder if I can do something different. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=556.0s)]
*  Right. Because I was going in the back and at the time Maki Maki was in managing me. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=563.0s)]
*  He still is. First time managing is. And I was like, he's like, you tell me what you want to do, bro. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=569.0s)]
*  You know, you just let me know and we'll figure it out. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=573.0s)]
*  And I was like, I wonder if I get on my contract. I was like, you know, try to do something different. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=575.0s)]
*  Because at the time I looked at it this way. If I were to fight Henry Ciro again for the third time, it could have gone either two ways. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=579.0s)]
*  One, I beat Henry, then I'm still stuck in the same situation I am right now when at the time they're trying to get rid of their talks about getting rid of the fly with division. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=587.0s)]
*  Right. Or two, if I lose to Henry, then I'm still stuck in the same position. I just lost to him again. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=595.0s)]
*  So why not see if I can go explore other options. Right. And then that's when the trade talks came about. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=600.0s)]
*  And so the UFC just said fine. Go ahead. Well, there was more to it. Right. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=606.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, Chacha just, you know, talked about it. It was I heard you had something to do with it as well. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=610.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'll get to that point. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=617.0s)]
*  So obviously, you know, they want it. Ben Asking has been one of the fighting UFC for a long time. Right. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=621.0s)]
*  And then so one championship and UFC were talking back and forth between Hunter and Matt Hume and Maki. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=628.0s)]
*  So like, hey, let's do a trade. Right. Like, we'll give you Ben Askren for Demetrius Johnson. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=635.0s)]
*  And then at one point, I heard that, you know, Dana was like, no, I don't I don't want to make that happen. Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=640.0s)]
*  I don't know the full I'm in the room where all the puzzle pieces are being shifted. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=646.0s)]
*  And then I was hanging out somewhere and then somebody said, you know, Joe Rogan had a PC now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=653.0s)]
*  And I was like, really? He goes, yeah. And I was told that you kind of convinced him. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=657.0s)]
*  I'm like, who gives a shit like just get get Ben Askren or something like that. So yeah, I know. Right. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=661.0s)]
*  So that's not really. No, I definitely was trying to get them to get Ben Askren. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=666.0s)]
*  But I was trying to get them to get Ben Askren back when he was a bellator, when he was in his prime. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=672.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like, listen, man, this guy is wrestle fucking everybody. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=677.0s)]
*  I want to see if he could do that to the whole division. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=681.0s)]
*  Like when when Ben was in his prime, when he did that to Koroskov and did that to Douglas Lima. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah. I was like, you got to understand how crazy this is that this guy can do this to everybody. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=689.0s)]
*  And people say, oh, it's boring. It's boring. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's fighting. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=694.0s)]
*  Yep. This guy is imposing his style on these murderers. Yeah. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=698.0s)]
*  I mean, Koroskov was a murderer and Douglas Lima is a fucking savage. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=703.0s)]
*  And he was just ragdolling these dudes and doing it weird ways. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=707.0s)]
*  I remember he he has a funky style about doing things. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=710.0s)]
*  And I remember somebody said he was training with him and he was able to twist and turn a certain way to where a normal human being would do it. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=713.0s)]
*  They would like tear their cartilage in their ribs. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=720.0s)]
*  And he was able to do that and bring him back to where he was. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=722.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, that's that's a freak right there. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=725.0s)]
*  But he's always wrestled like that because he's not like a physically imposing guy. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=727.0s)]
*  I'm sure he's very strong because he's been wrestling his whole life. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=731.0s)]
*  But his style was always like this is weird style that was very difficult for people to understand. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=734.0s)]
*  So they would they would try to like do traditional shit with him. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=739.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden they'd be on their back. Yeah, it just didn't work. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=742.0s)]
*  By the time we got him, though, he was already fucked up. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=745.0s)]
*  He needed a hip replacement. And he was already retired. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=748.0s)]
*  Right. And so that's that's what I heard. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=751.0s)]
*  And so when they were wanting to do that trade, they're like, yeah, we'll take Demetrius over Ben because Demetrius is still active. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=753.0s)]
*  And he's still, you know, still I was looking myself as a workhorse. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=760.0s)]
*  Right. Like I will you're paying me to fight. I'm going to fight. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=764.0s)]
*  Right. And so I think it was a no brainer for them. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=767.0s)]
*  And that's that's how it happened. Well, I definitely would have kept you in the UFC. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=770.0s)]
*  So that's not I'm sorry, sweetheart. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=774.0s)]
*  I mean, if you look at guys like Davidson, Figueredo, Brandon Moreno, there's some amazing fights for you. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And the flyway division has sort of risen up now. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=782.0s)]
*  There's there's a lot of like very interesting contenders now. Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=785.0s)]
*  But I don't have any say in like what what goes down. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=788.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not the guy that negotiating room. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=791.0s)]
*  Why am I saying you're the one who's like, we need to make this happen. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=794.0s)]
*  OK, we need to make it happen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=797.0s)]
*  Like I just heard that you kind of had like some type of persuasion, I guess you can say, when you guys were out and about. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=798.0s)]
*  But that's what I've been told. Like I said, I don't know the full story because I'm just an athlete. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=804.0s)]
*  I'm just hey, this is what I want. Can you guys make it happen? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=809.0s)]
*  Then I'll let the higher ups like Hunter, Matt Hume, Malky, they're doing all the pieces. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=812.0s)]
*  And then, you know, I know that could have been a fucking rumor. Right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=817.0s)]
*  So it's definitely a rumor. Oh, well, there you go. It's a rumor. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=820.0s)]
*  Don't believe it. But I definitely was excited to see Ben Askren come over to the UFC. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=823.0s)]
*  But and also as a fight fan, I was excited to see you go over to one. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=828.0s)]
*  Yeah, because the same way I was excited to see Eddie Alvarez over there. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=834.0s)]
*  And I think we need more events. More competition is good. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=838.0s)]
*  It's good for everybody. Absolutely. And what you're seeing now with one FC is these world class fucking guys. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=843.0s)]
*  Who's that guy that just fought John Lineker and broke his cup for BCO on dodge? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=849.0s)]
*  Fucking beast, man. Fucking he's nasty. He's a nasty man. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=853.0s)]
*  Fucking beast. And I'm like, look, man, these guys are out there. Oh, yeah. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=857.0s)]
*  The thing is, like, there's only so many slots in the UFC. Yep. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=862.0s)]
*  And every now and then a guy like Shavkat Rachmanoff comes on along. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=865.0s)]
*  Where the fuck this guy come from? Well, those dudes are out there in the world. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=869.0s)]
*  They're kickboxers, they're Sambo guys, they're Jiu Jitsu guys. They're out there in the world. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=872.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think Fabrício Andrade is absolutely amazing. That fight against him and John Lineker. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=876.0s)]
*  Bro, he was putting the boots to Lineker. Yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=881.0s)]
*  And he was timing that fucking that hook. Because John Lineker, he throws punches straight, hardly. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=883.0s)]
*  But it's usually the wild winged punches, right? And with Fabrício being so much taller than him, he's able to, you know, have good rhythm. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=889.0s)]
*  Throw that lead punch. I mean, right here, he was just like, boom. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=896.0s)]
*  He nailed him with that knee to the body, but then unfortunately followed up with one right in the cup. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=899.0s)]
*  Yeah, first off, why is John Lineker wearing a plastic cup? I know, right? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=905.0s)]
*  Why doesn't he have like one of those diamond MMA cups? Like I have a steel cup and it still hurts. Oh, you have a steel cup? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=910.0s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, I have a steel cup. They allow you to wear steel cups. God damn right, gotta protect these balls, baby. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=915.0s)]
*  I understand. Yeah. I understand. You're a father. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=919.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, I don't need them anymore, but I just don't want to have them. You're done? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=921.0s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah, I'm done. Absolutely. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=924.0s)]
*  But the steel cup is kind of fucked up. Why? Because it's metal. Because you're hitting metal. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=927.0s)]
*  You're hitting my balls. You definitely shouldn't hit it. Okay. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=933.0s)]
*  But you know, you could accidentally break your foot on metal. I can accidentally break my foot on your elbow. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=938.0s)]
*  I guess you could. Yeah, well it definitely happens. Yep. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=943.0s)]
*  But I feel like it should be, like the diamond MMA cup I think is the perfect balance because it's a compression cup, it's hard as fuck, you can take a solid shot. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=946.0s)]
*  Is it hard as steel? It's definitely not. Okay, well there we go. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=954.0s)]
*  But there's advantages to the diamond cup, or excuse me, to the steel cup that I feel like might be a little unfair, particularly with leverage and arm bars because it creates a fulcrum. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=957.0s)]
*  Yep. Like you've got a steel thing and you're bending the elbow over a steel thing. Yep, absolutely. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=967.0s)]
*  Yeah, you like it. I love it. Kenny Florian told me that too. He always fought with a steel cup on. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=973.0s)]
*  For me, I've been kicked in the balls before. You too. Yeah, and after, I think it was my second E. McCall fight. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=978.0s)]
*  So I kicked in the balls, go home, and you know, you get your balls and you got your testicles, balls, testicles, you have your wires behind it, right? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=988.0s)]
*  And next thing you know I'm like, holy shit, my balls hurt. Like two weeks, three weeks. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=996.0s)]
*  And next thing you know I'm like, something's wrong, babe, something is wrong. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1000.0s)]
*  So I go to the doctor and he's like, you know, checking underneath there, he goes, do you got a hernia? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1004.0s)]
*  I was like, you're fucking lying. He goes, yeah, you got a hernia. So I was about to get surgery to fix a hernia. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1008.0s)]
*  Then my wife was like, let's get a second opinion, right? I go to another doctor and he's checking underneath there and he goes, oh, dog, your wires are just, your wires are swollen. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1014.0s)]
*  You don't have a hernia. And so he was like, you just need the proxen to get the inflammation out of your sack, essentially. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1025.0s)]
*  You need a what to get the inflammation out? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1032.0s)]
*  The proxen. I think it's the proxen. It's anti-inflammatory. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1034.0s)]
*  So I took some of that and that cleared it up. But just from that kick, and I think this time I was wearing a plastic cup, he kicked me there, and my shirt was swollen. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1037.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, never again. I'm not going to wear a fucking plastic cup when I'm wearing a steel cup because you kicked in the balls and you needed the balls. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1046.0s)]
*  It's definitely the best protection. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that's why I wear it. You know, like even now I've been grappling in the gi. Like I still wear my cup when I grapple in the gi. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1054.0s)]
*  I trained with this dude once who had a steel cup on and we were grappling and he mounted me and put his steel cup in my fucking solar plexus with grapevines. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1060.0s)]
*  And I was like, God damn, dude, that's fucked up. It was so hard. It was like, it was just a metal piece just digging into your chest. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1071.0s)]
*  And he was a little bigger than me too, so he was like, all this weight on me. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1080.0s)]
*  He was like, he's basically dick fucking me with a metal piece. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1084.0s)]
*  I guess you could say that. I mean, I don't do that. Thank you. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1088.0s)]
*  I don't do that. And for me, if my opponent wants to wear a steel cup, please do. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1092.0s)]
*  I will insist you do wear a steel cup because I can't promise that my kicks aren't going to make it up there. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1096.0s)]
*  Shit happens. They collide. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1102.0s)]
*  I'd rather you do everything you can to protect your balls. Whether you want to wear plastic. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1104.0s)]
*  Well, a few guys have lost balls. There was a guy who was one of the Miltich guys who he was training and he didn't wear a cup for the last round. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1108.0s)]
*  He was like, last round, just a light sparring. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1117.0s)]
*  That's going to happen. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1119.0s)]
*  And some dude kicked him and his ball exploded. It's happened a bunch of times. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1120.0s)]
*  You see? Now you're on my side. You're going to go home like, I need a steel cup. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1124.0s)]
*  I really like the diamonds, those diamond MMA cups because they come with compression shorts and they really cinch up tight. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1128.0s)]
*  I have to look into it because it's funny because when I do grapple, they're like, why do you have that cup on? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1134.0s)]
*  I was like, I was grappling the other night and a guy tried to kick me over, kick me straight, straight in the balls. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1140.0s)]
*  And I was like, and it went like, dong. And I was like, you see, that's why I have that on. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1146.0s)]
*  Because if he would have hit me there, I would have tapped him like, I need 15 minutes to rest because you hit my balls. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1151.0s)]
*  Right. And hopefully you didn't damage them. Hopefully it's just a bruise. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1155.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1159.0s)]
*  Yeah, balls are fucking terrible design, God. Why did you put them on the outside like that? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1160.0s)]
*  I put two things and let it hang there and don't let them get hit because it's going to hurt truly bad. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1165.0s)]
*  How about some more time in the design and implementation phase of the human being? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1169.0s)]
*  I got all this extra. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1173.0s)]
*  The case with all animals. I was watching a lion kill a zebra the other day because I'm a mess. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1176.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's my algorithm. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1183.0s)]
*  And so I was watching this lion kill a zebra and it was horrible because the lions had the zebra down like a couple lions and one lion just goes right to the sack. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1186.0s)]
*  That's my sack. That's mine. Don't touch it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1194.0s)]
*  And she's just pulling the nut sack off of this zebra. I'm like, God damn it. Terrible design. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1197.0s)]
*  It's a faulty design in all the species, right? All the male species. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1206.0s)]
*  All the male species. Like the whole planet except for crustaceans and fish and snakes and shit. But everybody else, nuts are on the outside. Reptiles. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1210.0s)]
*  Well, you know, maybe we'll evolve and someone happened. Who knows? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1221.0s)]
*  Maybe. Maybe. Oh, Jesus Christ. Jamie, son of a bitch. Jamie goes right to me. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1226.0s)]
*  It's so horrible, man. Look at her. She's just pulling on that sack. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1232.0s)]
*  But you can see more. Oh, you can see more ruthless shit online. I was watching online today. I saw a dude kill a dude with an axe. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1239.0s)]
*  I was just like, my Instagram feed. Some dude is at a store holding on to an axe and he's like swinging the axe. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1249.0s)]
*  The dude is sitting there on his phone and this guy just axes him in the middle of his forehead. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1257.0s)]
*  Just decides to fuck it and just swings and just buries the axe in this dude's head. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1262.0s)]
*  That's fucking horrible. You should even watch this stuff. That's bad for you. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1268.0s)]
*  I couldn't help it. It just showed up. I was like, is this motherfucker really going to hit him with an axe on Instagram? Like, yep. Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1271.0s)]
*  Wow. You see so much shit. You see more mayhem, more chaos, more animals getting torn apart by lions and leopards and shit. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1277.0s)]
*  It's like you see so much. Yeah. The internet is a dangerous place. I try to stay off it as much as possible. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1286.0s)]
*  And the fact that you can see shit like that on the internet with somebody just getting axed in the forehead is absolutely crazy. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1292.0s)]
*  It's ridiculous. The fact that it's on Instagram, I mean, I'm sure they pull it eventually. But someone's got to report it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1298.0s)]
*  I'm sure when it's on there, somebody took a screen capture, reported it, and then it's off. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1303.0s)]
*  And then they put it on Reddit and now it's on 4chan. If it makes on the internet, it's there forever. It's surfing around somebody's mainframe somewhere. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1308.0s)]
*  But on the plus side, if you're a martial artist, your access to techniques is off the charts. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1319.0s)]
*  1000%. When you started, when you were 18 years old, what year was that? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1325.0s)]
*  I'll say 2006. Yeah, there wasn't nearly as much available. There was some. It was definitely better than like starting in the 90s. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1330.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, 2006. But what the fuck, man? There's so much information now on technique and you could watch so many different styles, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1338.0s)]
*  so many different people competing both in Muay Thai and Jiu Jitsu and wrestling and everything. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1345.0s)]
*  Yep. Well, it's funny because when I'm grappling in my gi, I'll come back, I'll see someone on Instagram. I'm like, okay, I see that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1350.0s)]
*  I'll come in general, like, success, it works. And then I'll get them a chokes. I'll learn that on Instagram. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1356.0s)]
*  They're like, shut the hell up. I swear to God, just this morning. But yeah, I think the internet could be a good place and could be a horrible place. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1363.0s)]
*  Well, that's humans. Humans could be good or they could be horrible. 1000%. The internet is just information. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1370.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think there's great information on the internet to get techniques to see how somebody's done a certain move or how they're manipulating or shit to fix a car as well. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1377.0s)]
*  A lot of times when I have a problem, my wife's like, babe, I can't get this to work. I'll hang up, baby. I'll try it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1388.0s)]
*  I'm like, let me go in my office real quick. I gotta go read a book. Okay, come back up like I'm a fucking genius. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1393.0s)]
*  Oh, you just gotta do this and this. She goes, wow, good job. I was like, yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1400.0s)]
*  She doesn't know about the internet? I mean, she does. But in the dark. Well, she just keep her in the dark. Keep her thinking that you're a wizard. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1404.0s)]
*  But the so one is also streaming, right? Stream on. Is it on Amazon Prime? Amazon Prime. That's great. That is amazing. Amazing. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1414.0s)]
*  Like after the TNT deal, I think we did four fights on TNT. I felt like TNT was really focused on AEW, right? Like every single time you go on TNT was always AEW, AEW using us. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1422.0s)]
*  I felt using us as a launch a platform to bring more fans to AEW from my perspective. But like when the deal when the deal happened with Amazon, I didn't know it did. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1435.0s)]
*  And then, you know, there's talks about like, hey, we just landed a brand new US broadcast deal. And I was like, okay, who could it be? Is it is it, you know, YouTube? Who is it? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1446.0s)]
*  And they see it was actually Amazon. Amazon. I was like, oh, this is a this is a fucking game changer. It is if Amazon gets behind it. It is. They are. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1455.0s)]
*  Are they getting behind it in terms of like publicity and 1000%? Yeah, that's good. I mean, because they have so much. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1464.0s)]
*  It's such a weird platform because you also can buy shoes. Yep. You know, you could buy fucking jumper cables. You buy anything by anything. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1472.0s)]
*  Buy a kidney on fucking Amazon. But if you have Amazon Prime, which like most people do, you also have access to all these television show music television show terminal list. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1480.0s)]
*  Amazing ring of powers. I mean, it's now we have live fights. Yeah. What championship? So I love it. I love that they're doing that. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1489.0s)]
*  I just want more opportunities for fighters because I think if the sport is going to grow, I love the UFC. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1498.0s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not working anywhere else, but there's only 500 fighters in the UFC. Yeah, there's thousands and thousands of elite fighters all over the world. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1504.0s)]
*  And if they don't get a shot, guys like Adriano, guys like what's the guy's name that fought Lineker again? Fabricio and Josh. Guys like that. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1515.0s)]
*  Like, where is that guy coming from? You know, I mean, guys like who's the what's the dude that knocked out Giorgio Petrosian? Superbon. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1522.0s)]
*  Nasty. Nasty. Nasty. Did you do that to Petrosian? I mean, Petrosian is like recognized as one of the very best kickboxers of all time. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1529.0s)]
*  And for him to like right kick to the body, right kick to the head like that. Holy shit. Dude, like when I tell people the kickboxing like, yeah, look at this right kick to the body. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1540.0s)]
*  Right kick to the body. Boom. Yeah. To see Petrosian go out like that is wild. Has he fought since? I don't think he has. I don't think he has. Yeah. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1550.0s)]
*  That's one of those KOs that, you know, like when Terry Adam got knocked out by Edson Barboza. Oh yeah, the spinning back kick. You're like, I don't know if you come back from that one. Yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1560.0s)]
*  There's sometimes when dudes get hit, it's like it's so brutal. You might never see them again. Yeah. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1569.0s)]
*  The biggest thing that I love about one championship is like the ever so all man, you know, the striking is unbelievable. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1574.0s)]
*  But I was like, no, dude, like you want to see some high level fucking striking like Suwan, Giorgio, my favorite person to watch that's just pure kickboxing is Hiro Okamoto. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1580.0s)]
*  Like I was there live when he won the belt. I think it was, it was in Singapore. I was sitting there watching and I was like, oh my God, like this man, like his pop pop pop kick and he'll block and then fire back immediately. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1590.0s)]
*  And I'm like, fucking amen. I was like, absolutely amazing. Like just I'm blown away. Well, that's one of the also the beautiful things about what they're doing at one is that you get to see striking with no grappling, no grappling. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1604.0s)]
*  So you get to see what the most elite expression. Exactly. The purest form. Yes. The purest form of striking like these two guys. That's all we do. We don't play on the ground. We don't grapple. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1616.0s)]
*  It's pure striking. And that's like one of the things I love to watch is like when I'm sitting there and people are like, oh man, would you like to watch? Well, obviously I like to watch, you know, mixed martial arts. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1626.0s)]
*  But when I get the chance to watch like high level like kickboxing, especially heavyweights who move fast, like I don't know the gentleman's name. There's a kickboxer one. He's fucking massive. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1635.0s)]
*  And he's got fucking six pack and he's got good packs. He's just he looks like a superhero and he's like pop pop pop high kick uppercut right hand. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1645.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, this is amazing. That's the one of the things I love about with one chip. It's just you get the purest of the form. But then in contrast, you get there is that. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1653.0s)]
*  Look at him. Let me see that again. But like a fucking superhero pop. Look at that. Who is that dude? Roman Crilli. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1664.0s)]
*  Crilli Crilli Crick Crickla Cricklia Cricklia. Like, damn, dude, like, look at that guy. Oh, Jesus. Louisa. Yeah. What has just happened to me? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1672.0s)]
*  And then look, he's got them come right back for some more. Just get right back in there. Pop pop pop. Just is he rushing that dude? I have no idea. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1684.0s)]
*  Sounds Russian. Yeah, but whatever is from that part of the world. Like, that's the thing I love about watching one is like when he fights, I always try to watch because he you know, he and then boom, like you're just exchanging like we were like, I hate watching. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1692.0s)]
*  I hate watching grappling. I was like, perfect. Watch this and don't say anything. Shut your mouth and just enjoy this. Like, like stand up is just I just love it. It's just that's the purest like MMA striking would never get there. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1705.0s)]
*  Well, I can't. You can't. And the good contrast that is your second round with Rod Tang. Yeah, this is why this is striking because you can't open yourself up like that. No, you can't. Go to that second round. Go to the second round with Rod Tang and DJ. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1717.0s)]
*  DJ. So this is second round. You're like, okay, baby. Now it's time to get it back. And you see Rod Tang. Look nearly as confident either. He kind of realizes look at me. He's on the outside now. Different game. It's a different game. Look at him now. Look at the difference. Yeah. Look at the fucking difference. Man. What a contrast. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1730.0s)]
*  My my corner man, James James, I love the man. He goes, look at him. He's running. Look at him. He's running right now. Of course he's running. What's the wild contrast difference between the first and the second round? Yeah. Well, like you say, you can't open yourself up. Right. He really can't even move forward. Yeah. Because if he does, I'm taking you down. Like he's basically resigning himself to being defensive in this round. Look at how his hands are positioned. Yeah. He's looking to just push you away. Yeah. He's looking to get the fuck out of there. And for me, it was like, I just need to make I have three minutes to work. Right. And I'm like, okay, I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1753.0s)]
*  Okay. I got to make sure when I get there, I have to be subtle. So these are one of the things I felt that it's helped me in my in my evolution is becoming better. I know it's crazy to say being 36 years old is just taking my look at that. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1783.0s)]
*  Duck under. Just taking my time. That's a wrap, son. You ain't getting out of this. Yeah. That was the beautiful thing about watching that fight is seeing the difference between these elite strikers when they're just allowed to strike and then seeing the difference between an elite MMA fighter and how he knows he can't [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1794.92s)]
*  implement his game the same way. That's just how it's this is a beautiful example of why mixed martial arts is the best combat sport in the world. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1812.76s)]
*  One thousand percent. I think it's a it's the best art form. Right. Obviously, you're bringing all of them together. But if you if you have somebody who's a great boxer, you know, if you're an MMA guy, you can play in that realm of boxing. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1822.76s)]
*  You can take him to a place where he can't breathe. And or if you have a guy who's a great jiu-jitsu guy, it's like perfect. I'm not going to go to ground. If we do, I'm going to punch in the face and elbow like Matt Hughes. He's like, everybody knows I do arm bar. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1836.16s)]
*  So you punch him in the face and you know, everything, you know, is forgotten. Yeah. You're creeping with that left arm. Yeah. Here I've been focused on in the training camp. I didn't care if I got any through chain. I was working on my squeeze and just try to squeeze the blood out of your head. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1845.16s)]
*  It was amazing. And that dude fucking hung in there. He did. He did. He took it. I mean, he's getting the fuck choked out of him, too. See, he's got a steel cup on. It's actually a Muay Thai steel cup. Yeah. So he went out, too. Yeah. Good for him. No tapping. Yeah. Just tried to hang in there as long as he could. Yeah. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1859.16s)]
*  But that that to me is one of the more interesting things about seeing a match like that. It's like you get to see like it's people that don't know who's going to beat that guy. Look at the striking. Yeah. He's he's going after my emails. One of the greatest of all time. Look how he's beating them up. And then you see the second. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1878.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, that's that's what would happen if they. Yeah, that's what would happen. That's why I love. Like I said, that's why I love that. When they offered me that fight at the beginning, I'm like, hey, we want you to fight Rod's for the Muay Thai World Championship. I was like, guys, I'm very, very grateful and very appalled. But I try to kill you. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1894.16s)]
*  They do show like that over there. They give me when Sarukian when Eddie Alvarez fought Sarukian. That's the dude knocked him out in one chip chip. Yes. Who blew his eyeball up. The dude, the first duty fought over there. Timothy Nasty Nukin. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's right. I'm thinking of a different guy. Yeah. But blew his eyeball up. Right. The name sound. Yeah. I think of Nasty Nukin. Yeah. Nasty Nukin. I call him Nasty. Mr. Nasty. But I think of Nasty Nukin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1912.16s)]
*  But he is nasty. Yeah. So he's another one of those guys like you never heard of him. You've never heard him. But then you watch him fight. Find that fight. You never see him before. But you go before the KO. But when you see him fight you like Jesus Christ. Where the fuck's this guy been? Right. Out of nowhere. And big as fuck too. Yeah. Well Eddie's fighting 170 right now. Right. So it's not 155 when he's fighting in the UFC. So in one chip chip there's no weight cutting. You have to weigh and hydrate it. Right. So that's why the guy looks massive compared to Eddie. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1942.16s)]
*  Think about Eddie's been spending pretty much all his career cutting the 155. He's a big 155. He's a huge 155. So now he's fighting guys in 170. The proportion. You've seen a guy at 155 his whole career. Now he's at 170. It's like oh he's going to look different. Right. Now how how do they do the hydration thing? That's very controversial. Yeah. OK. It's like didn't nine people miss weight in the last event. So how they do it. So when you weigh in first you gotta do your hydration. You gotta do your your hydration test. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=1972.16s)]
*  You go in the bathroom guy watches you pee in the cup. You bring it out. They sit up there and they test the gravity of your urine. Right. So obviously the urine is more. Yeah. Right. Space piss. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2002.16s)]
*  So they test our space piss as you would call it. And they want to see the gravity. Right. So if it's more yellow which means you're more dehydrated. I think it's there's a I think it's called but it's a little almost like a thermometer. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2016.48s)]
*  Right. It's taking it. It's like two. I think it's a two point five. If it's two five zero you're on the cusp. Right. If it's two five one you're dehydrated. You fail. Right. Interesting. If you're overly hydrated. Right. Because if you just drink a whole bunch of water you're going to piss clear. Right. Mm hmm. That means you're overly hydrated. The people have failed that as well. Overly hydrated. So be overly hydrated. So is that because you're trying to mask the fact that you're dehydrated. It could be something like that. Like I remember there was a time in a fight where Shinga Aoki. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2031.52s)]
*  He peed and his shit was like zero zero zero one. And I like dude you're way overly hydrated. Like come back and do it. They might have changed it. Right. But this was back in like I think we're fighting it was in Japan I think in 2019 I feel like. And so you want to be in a sweet spot. Right. You want to be too low. You want to be too high. Right. So I just try to be right in the middle. So how do they make sure that that's your actual weight though. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2061.52s)]
*  So you know you can't really can't. But you what you can do is prevent serious seriously like what Hamza Chmaev does. Yes. That kind of 1000 percent. Right. And 35 pounds. Well here's the thing. If you fight. So my natural walk along way like whatever I want to eat and all that stuff is like 142. Right. So when I started dieting I'll get down to 138 and working out. Right. So I'm three pounds away from the cut off for 135. Reasonable. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2090.08s)]
*  Reasonable. Like I don't like when I was 25 I was fucking like not killing myself but I was cutting weight. So what would you weigh the day before you began your cut at 125. About 128 127. That's not bad. So you dehydrate or you know. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2120.08s)]
*  So I would drink two gallons of water for two weeks straight. So I think a gallon of water is what eight pounds. I think it right. Eight pounds. I could be wrong. Explain how that works. Yeah. So what I did when I was cutting 125 I drink two gallons of water for two weeks straight. And what you're doing is your water loading your body. So you're basically just pissing all day. So your body gets used to having all this extra water on you. Right. And then as you're dieting. Yeah. So eight pounds. See my math is good. So it's eight pounds. So I drink two gallons of water. I got 16 pounds of water in me that I can water. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2138.56s)]
*  I don't lose. So when I jump in the tub to cut my weight I'm not pulling from my organs my kidneys and all that stuff. And then you make 125 you get out and then you I would make the weight. Right. So that's what it does. It keeps it from pulling from your organs from my scientific. I'm not a scientist Joe but I've never missed. I'm not. You didn't know that. I didn't know. Oh shit. Well now you know I'm not a scientist. All right. And I'm not a fucking doctor as well. So people when you hear this don't don't say I said you can do it. But that's what I did. Right. I would drink two gallons of water. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2168.56s)]
*  Do you do distilled water. No just basic water. That's dangerous. Yeah I've heard that too. I heard somebody had a seizure on that shit. Oh Jesus. So I was like no because you're just robbing your body of electrolytes and minerals and you are pissing out your electrolytes and your minerals too. Right. Because when you drink that much water sit me two gallons. Like when I thought killed her Gucci I got like I guess you call it water poison because I was going from Toronto excuse me from Seattle always Toronto. All right. And I'm dieting too. So there's nothing [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2198.56s)]
*  on a plane that you can eat that's going to you know it's all full of sodium. I'm going to hang on to all the water. Right. And obviously cut off the sodium so your body flushes the water. But on the way to Toronto I drank two gallons of water before boarding the plane. Right. Jesus. And so the whole plane ride I need anything just pounding water. I get there and I'm just sick like just as a dog. And next thing you know Matt's like you just want to land. I always get work. I was like Matt I don't feel good. Like I don't want to work out. And he goes. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2228.56s)]
*  OK. All right. No worries. Go to bed. Next day woke up and he goes hey you need to eat. And I ate shit. This right through me. And I just couldn't keep anything down. The next thing you know a couple of days he goes don't train. Just relax. And then the UFC when we do media and he was like no dog he's not he's not feeling good. Then eventually the third day started to feel better. And then when it came to cutting weight I was able to make weight because I was just losing so much from you know being sick. And I remember the first time in the fight when I got taken down I think it was the first time. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2258.56s)]
*  So the second round I was like I don't fucking want to be here right now. Like I am. I'm just not. I'm not here. Like I'm not in it. But then you know we rallied and people died from drinking too much water. Oh I know. I know. So crazy. Like fraternity hazings and shit. Well shit I hear GSP does what a water fast for three days. I was talking to some gentlemen here and they're like yeah we're about to do our our three day water fast man. I'm super pumped. I was like I would get a headache. Like I just couldn't do it. But yeah but he doesn't drink that much water. He just true. Only water. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2288.56s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. He's not drinking two gallons. So I misinterpreted that he's just drinking two gallons of water. Let's go boys. And right. But yeah so that's what I did when I cut 20 125. I drink two gallons water for two weeks straight diet down cut out the sodium cut out. Then I'll cut off water the day before weighing and then sit in a tub boil myself and then why the why the tub and not the sauna. Because the sauna was not accessible to where you're fighting. Right. Like you always got a tub wherever you're fighting. Right. So [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2318.56s)]
*  I mean I remember when I fought Joseph the second time I cut like eight point two pounds eight point two pounds that day to make the weight and we use a tub. So it works good. So what one FC does is how many days before the fight to the tester hydration. So before COVID which is this is what I really like. This is how you try to keep people at the same weight. Right. Like how you have something blown from 180 come down to 140. Right. You obviously can't stop it. It's [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2348.56s)]
*  going to happen. Right. But you would have to win two times. Right. So in the past you would fight on Saturday. So you win Thursday test hydration and win Friday test hydration and win. So if I weighed 135 on Thursday 135 on Friday the likely chance of me blowing up to whatever 155 165. It's kind of not going to happen unless I'm going to put on too much excessive weight. Right. And then now they weigh you after you're done fighting. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2378.56s)]
*  So that's another thing that starts to implement as well. So when I fought Adriano with 135 after the fight I weighed 138 and then the next day I woke up weighing 136. So I don't blow back up you know like these guys do when they cut all that massive weight. So that's the biggest thing is that hydration check the weight. If you feel hydration you're not checking your weight. Right. You might be on weight you might be 135 but you're fucking over dehydrated. They're not going to let you step on the scale. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2408.56s)]
*  Nope. Don't get hydrated. Obviously to get hydrated you drink water you drink water you get heavier. You got to. So it's a fine. What do they do if you miss the weight. When all those people missed weight there's like nine fighters in the car that missed weight. They have opportunity to go back and get their hydration in check and get the weight in check. But if you're missing weight you're too big. Yeah. How are you going to get smaller without dehydrating. That's the science behind it. You have to. So what I've heard people do is that they will they would you know try to get [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2438.56s)]
*  a lot of water get their bladder full of hydrated water right. And then they'll go work out lose the weight in your bladder. So it has a hydrated water. And then what they do is I'm on weight I weigh 135 135. I have this hydrated water or urine space piss in my bladder. Then I go out there and I pee hydrated hydrated and then I weigh in 135. So that's I've heard people do that before as well. So there's like some shenanigans. There's always going to be some shenanigans right. But I think the biggest thing is [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2468.56s)]
*  that weighing after the fight right. Because after you fight you know if I fought a drone I went I weighed in 135 and I come off the scale off the cage I'm like 162 and they weigh me. And it's OK dude. Like that's too big of a drastic a jump between 135 to one to 165. Do you think there should be more weight classes in MMA. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2498.56s)]
*  No no I think you're good. I think 135 125 145 155. I think there could be 160. But here's the thing. Bless you. Thank you. Thank you. I was a wild one. I almost pulled my back out. I was like I think when you have when you have more these weight classes you're going to start seeing people try to get go like 155 to one. It goes 161 50 5 to one eighty five. Right. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2519.56s)]
*  No 70. Oh yes. I think it's fine. I have any day. He has a big jump. So 15 pounds. That's a lot. That's true. That's a lot. Fuck I grab people who are way bigger. I'm not fighting them. So it's different. But the fighting thing is the difference. Yeah. And then 85 to 205 is crazy. Yeah. I mean it could. I mean I don't see why not. I mean obviously more weight classes more opportunities for fighters to make. So why not. More champions more champion versus champion matchups. Yeah. So you can. I can see. I mean why not. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2549.56s)]
*  I think 10 pounds is reasonable. Every 10 is reasonable. Yeah. So whether it 145 155 165 175 185. Yeah. Yeah. One is what I do. And then 215 and then heavyweight call it. Yes. So I mean let's see why not. I mean it's not like it's going to hurt the like anybody's brand. More weight classes. I don't think it would hurt anything but it'll give more athletes opportunity to build and make money and make some more shots. And you won't have people come. You know because when over in Singapore and I see the guys who make 125 like Jared Brooks and then Alex Silva. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2579.56s)]
*  We're all the same height. And I'm like how the fuck are you guys making 125 hydrated. Like I can I do it. But then when I get next time like I'm just more girthier like I'm just bigger. And I'm like but I'm the same height. But so I feel is it because people opportunity to be at certain weight classes where if he was a fight me at 135 then he'd be like you know to be size disadvantage. Yeah. Well especially at the lower weight classes it's a larger percentage of body weight. Yeah. Like a 10 pound gap at heavyweight is not that big of a deal. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2609.56s)]
*  And when it's my weight it's a huge it's a huge deal because you know the percentage of your body fat or body fat but your weight. Another thing that I think is weird is the weight limit at heavyweight. Yeah. I know when they miss it I'm like how the fuck you missed to 65. But the fact that it exists at all. Yeah. They just have an open weight just like yeah. Why do you have a 265 cut off for the biggest fighter in the UFC. I don't know. You know it is what it is. Francis can weigh whatever the fuck he wants. I want to see what he weighs. I was like 308. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2639.56s)]
*  I think he would probably like well I think he'd probably be exactly what he is. Yeah. I think he's like the perfect specimen. Exactly. I don't I don't foresee him cutting a whole bunch of weight. No I don't think he cuts anyway. But he just stays lean. Yeah. Which is perfect anyway. Yeah I totally agree. Yeah. But when you think about the opportunities that would be available if you had every 10 pounds I think I only see positives. Yeah. One thousand percent. No negative. Only positive. Like you said when you said it gives athletes a better opportunity to make more opportunity for athletes and fighters to [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2669.56s)]
*  be able to compete. Why not. Right. Yeah. I only I only see positives. So they came to you and they asked you to fight for the World Muay Thai Championship. Oh yeah. Back in that story. Yeah. We just go on these little tangents little journeys and shit. So I was on the couch with the wife and I was like hey babe. Well they said once you fight him I was like you know guys I'm grateful for the opportunity. I was like I have no interest in being a World Muay Thai fighter. Like I just don't stand on my bucket list. I don't really care. But I was like but I will fight. And I said and I don't want to discourage [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2699.56s)]
*  you from fighting for the World Muay Thai Championship. I mean I mean I don't want to disrespect the other guys who been working their whole lives to capture that dream. Did you ask for MMA first. No I didn't. I said let me let me let me finish the story. I got it. OK. Sorry sorry. Cut me off. Joe was promised you. I mean one round. No no. Let me get there. OK. You're going to love it. OK. I hope you love it. I love it. I'm sure. So I said I said I don't I don't want to take that opportunity for somebody else who wants to be a Muay Thai World Champion. I was like I was like I'll still fight Rod saying we could fight through three three threes. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2729.56s)]
*  We're going to make it happen. And they're like yeah. OK. We'll come back to you. We'll think of something. And they they called me back. And then I hung up the phone. I thought about life and she goes who said I was. Who was one. She was with a one. I was like the one who fight Rod saying she goes. What you fight Rod. Yeah. And she goes well how do you feel. I was like it'll be fun. You see what happens. I was like remember this. But that's what they pay me to do is fight. This is why I fight to make money. Right. She goes yeah. She was OK. Well you know he's very dangerous. So we'll see what happens. They call me back now like hey. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2759.56s)]
*  How would we do a special rules fight. I was like I'm listening and they're like one round Muay Thai second round MMA third round Muay Thai fourth round. I mean I was like and what are the rounds. She's like three minute rounds. I was like still same same contract pay and all that stuff. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2789.56s)]
*  He was like yeah but like send a contract. And then when when it got announced he's like dog. I can't believe you do MMA first. And he was like he was like how can you argue for MMA. I was like guys I'm 35 years old. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2805.4s)]
*  I'm tired of arguing and trying to get the upper hand and do all that shit. I was like if I can't make it out the first round of Muay Thai then so be it. I don't care. Like I just don't care. And that's how I left it. I didn't care about it. It was first round Muay Thai or second round. I didn't care. Right. I just truly didn't care. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2819.44s)]
*  Well we got to see the contrast that way. Exactly. Yeah. If we didn't it would have been over the first round. I would have gone out there. Take him down. Pass guard. Submitted him like OK. Gigi's boy. But you know like I said. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2837.5600000000004s)]
*  Good game baby. Oh. You're doing video game talk. Yeah I am. I am sorry. That's OK. You're a heavy duty gamer. Yeah. Sorry. But yeah. So there was no back and forth. And that's how for me that's how I wanted to be. Right. I'm at the end. I'm at the end of my career. Like I know it. Like there's the end of the tunnel. I see it. I'm smiling looking at it. And the last thing I want to do is sit here go back and forth. But the company the company like I really think we should do everything. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2849.0s)]
*  I'm a mafious like I think I was like you know what. Like if I get knocked out the first round I tried. Did you talk to botang at all afterwards and asking how you trained. I said how hard did I hit you. Was it hard. He was it was OK. No. Hey boys. Hey hey we take that. We'll take that. You know. But the beautiful thing about over there is that it's like a frat house. Like it's like a college house. What I mean by that is like after that fight you know we're all in the back. You see stamp. You see Adrian. You see you walk on my to you. You see. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2879.0s)]
*  You see you rotting. We're all seen or just talking just chopping it up like you know I remember Adriano told us stamp. I was like oh I wanted to win so bad. She fought Angel Lee that Angel Lee that night I believe. And she goes I wanted to win so bad. And Adriano was like it's OK. Today it wasn't your time. You have to learn. You learn from this. Right. So we're all we're all trying to make sure we all eat. Right. And it's not like you're back. You see fucking Leon Edwards and Jorge. They're always cutting each other down. Right. Like that's the biggest thing that I don't like seeing. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2909.0s)]
*  It's like you don't have to cut somebody cut somebody down to make yourself look better. Right. But that cutting down is part of the psychological warfare. Yeah. For a weak minded person. Yeah. I mean you can say all the shit you want when that case goes I'm getting it. You're getting the full you're getting the full force of me. Like I don't give two rats ass. What are you saying to me like you can say whatever you want. But not Kate when that door closes I'm getting your fucking ass. Has anybody ever pissed you off to the point where you fought differently. No nobody. Because it's why are you saying that. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2939.0s)]
*  I'm saying something to begin with like like we're gonna fight. We're gonna fight like you can say whatever you want. Like I'm going to I'm just going to bring it like there's there's two sides to me. Right. There's me who's just chilling and happy go lucky. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2969.0s)]
*  And then there's a dark side of me where it's like we're going to they're paying me to fight. And this is what I provide my family. So you can see where the fuck you want to me. When that door closes I'm going to give you every bit of me. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2982.4s)]
*  I'm going to I fought with a broken hand broken rib broken leg. And then it is they're going to fix me back to 100 percent but I'm going to give you 100 percent of me. Like I tell myself give yourself focus 125 percent meaty on this this task at hand. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=2992.04s)]
*  So when I see people cutting each other down a psychological war and I'm like why are you talking. Shut the fuck up and just fight like the Islam and Charles Oliver fight like them. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3007.2799999999997s)]
*  I get goosebumps seeing them stare down not talk right because I know the gravity of what they to bring what they bring to the table. Yeah. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3018.88s)]
*  All of their so respectful so respectful and that that makes me that turns me on even more to those athletes. Right. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3025.84s)]
*  Like people who talk like I made you do this da da da da da. Who gives a fuck. But in my opinion right. But oh man it's so I don't care. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3033.04s)]
*  I'm watching because I know the gravity of your skill set. That's what turns me on. Right. So but then there's a lot of things where I try to just I try to push my way because I go down like a rabbit hole. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3040.56s)]
*  I'm like I don't need this. It just it's kind of like you when you watch people getting murdered on the Internet. Like for me I'm like I just got to step away for a little bit and push it away. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3051.56s)]
*  Yeah. But the good thing about the shit talking is pay per view buys exactly like what Connor does. Yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3059.88s)]
*  That dude brings eyeballs. Yeah. 100 percent. And part of it is his ability to talk. But yeah but also the fight. Hey I'm not gonna lie. Hey when when Betch Grier-Hara and Ronda Rousey were about to fight and then I remember Betch says on the run a runner was I'm gonna be this bitch. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3067.16s)]
*  I got my pay for you. But you sold me. I purchased it. And you know what Connor I mean he took the sports a whole new level like I never forget I was playing Counter Strike. Right. And I'm sitting there playing shooting people. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3082.44s)]
*  And then I was like you know who kind of a great guy is. Yeah. What do you been living on a fucking rock. I'm like this motherfucker made it to the game world. You play video games like good for you. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3096.92s)]
*  So those people you're playing know it's you know. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3108.12s)]
*  My favorite thing is like when I'm out and about like you know I live in a nice nice place you know Washington and people like someone comes in and say hey man I get a picture and you know I'll take a picture like sure why not. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3117.3999999999996s)]
*  You know they know who I am. You know right. But then my favorite is when people are like you know they're all looking around they're looking at this small five three black guy in the middle of nowhere with like two kids like who the fuck is this guy. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3127.56s)]
*  And I'm like oh my god are you famous. I'm like yeah yeah I'm famous. Oh my god what do you do. So I like to have I have a whole list of lies I like to do. One of them is I am a CEO of a pharmaceutical company. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3140.36s)]
*  And they're like oh what type of what type of you know pharmaceuticals. Oh male enhancement pills you know it's whatever you need. Just go on these you know lies and why do you do that because it's fucking fun. That's why I do it. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3153.6000000000004s)]
*  I do it and then my favorite one was we'll go to a wedding and we're at a wedding and some people recognize me some people don't and they're like oh my god who is that. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3166.0800000000004s)]
*  He's a famous person and they're like oh what do you do. I'm like work for NASA. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3175.92s)]
*  No like just the most outlandish shit ever. I'm like work for NASA and I was like just got back from the moon it's beautiful out there. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3178.84s)]
*  I didn't know he was in the moon. I was like absolutely. You know there's a lot of shit out there. People just go on these stories. It's my acting career. That's what I'm working on. But I just do that. It's fun. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3186.32s)]
*  But my kids are getting older so they're starting to cut my they're starting to cock block me. They're like no no no it's him. It's him. Yeah it's Demetrius. It's him. Yeah. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3194.96s)]
*  I was like time you can't do that. Let me have my fun while it lasts. So yeah that's that's where I get my my jollies. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3203.16s)]
*  Yeah. But so who is the trash talk to you the most before a fight. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3211.0s)]
*  I think I think the two people was probably John Dodson the second fight and Ray Borg Ray Borg. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3217.0s)]
*  I remember when I fight John Dodson he said I was boring X Y and Z. And so that fight I was like I'm just going to take it to you like when you kick me in the balls and like he kicked me. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3226.04s)]
*  I was like no no no no no no no no no no no break. You don't get no fucking break at all. And he goes oh OK whatever. Even though I hurt but you got that steel cup on so you take some of that absorption. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3234.3999999999996s)]
*  But when he said to me it was like being bored and I was OK I'm just going to push the pace like I'm just going to try to drown you right. Obviously I want to get to finish but wasn't able to get it. And then Ray Borg he said [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3244.7599999999998s)]
*  my wrestling wasn't good right. And so I made it a point that I'm going to out scramble you in that fight like every single scramble I may try one that scramble because he said I can out scramble you. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3254.68s)]
*  Bro that finish was one of the wildest submissions I've ever seen. Suplex to armbar in the air. Yeah. In the air you cut it. And then when you told me that you practiced that. Yep. And then you hit that in practice. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3264.0s)]
*  That is why that's one of the wildest finishes I've ever seen. Thanks man. Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. When it got dead to me first. Matt he did it to me and he caught me and I was like what the fuck was that. He goes well you're getting so good now I can't just do a basic armbar like I have to I have to experiment essentially. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3276.6800000000003s)]
*  And so when he did it when he did to me I was like you have to teach it to me. So I would do it and I do it and he says you know what your biggest weakness is. Teach. I'm like what he goes. You think. Stop thinking it just do. And then when I was in the fight. That's some Bruce Lee shit right there. Yeah it is right. Here it is. Let's take a look at it. Boom. That was so wild man. That was so wild. Yeah. It's funny because he said stop. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3295.72s)]
*  Stop thinking just do just let your body do it. It knows what to do. And we just learned how to not was teaching Matt teaching in concept which I love. And he said that if somebody is holding on the way right. If somebody is trying to be extremely heavy you can't. It's going to be a lot harder to move somebody right. But if you can get them to move their weight or shift their way to a certain way then they're lighter. I was like that's where he was teaching at that time. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3325.8799999999997s)]
*  So in that fight I had Ray Borg's back and he's being heavy he's trying to like he knows I'm going to try to get a takedown. He's trying to be heavy. So I said OK. He's in my mind I was like he's heavy right now. I was like OK. I have to make him shift his weight. I don't want to shift his weight. He needs to shift the weight. So I kept needing him and needing him and needing him. And then once he went like. I was like perfect. You just shifted your weight. Go back Jamie if you get to. That's sex stuff. OK. At the beginning he kind of ubbled it. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3354.12s)]
*  He just ubbled me in the back of the face and once he ubbled me he he basically gave me his weight. And once he did that I was like perfect thank you. And it's threw him up and got him. So yeah but that finish and my last Adriano finish was probably like like if I can have it on my not on my wall but if someone was like hey what are your best finishes. I'll say those two because I think that's the pinnacle of technique coming in real time. Well the Adriano too. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3384.12s)]
*  One of the beautiful things was you got him with the exact same thing he got you with. Yes. But in a different way. A different way. One thousand percent. And I think the distance control following him and then knowing the cages coming and then just giving everything I had into it was probably like that's like doesn't get any better than that. That's like picture perfect. If you look at the slow mo you see I'm in south pop position I'm on the outside of the leg lining up my left knee in milliseconds like you're playing with windows of [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3414.12s)]
*  opportunity that are open and closing like that. Those why and then the Ray Borgman is like I'm throwing him up and then I have to make sure when he loses his balance I have to catch it and land and throw. Like I like working with like the windows of opportunity. So those two are like why are they my favorite because it's like when you break down the technique of it it's like. Finally Adriano one because the Adriano finish in the last one was so beautiful what you're saying. Like we like not not. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3444.12s)]
*  And it's funny people like man would you like. I was like Matt he's done it to me my whole career. Not blasting your face but understanding like lining up your knee. Here comes the cage or here comes the ring and then throwing and he's done it to me. I seen him do to rich. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3474.12s)]
*  I seen him do this. Jen's pullover. Spencer Fisher. I seem to do it to all those guys. So being able to do it in real time at a world championship level. It was like perfect. Yeah it was the timing of it was fantastic. Yeah the fact that Matt has like Matt has been your coach and that you you're one of the greatest of all time. It's kind of amazing that there's not more guys from him that are on that level. It takes a special I think. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3489.12s)]
*  Bond I think it takes a special athlete you know obviously injuries play a factor in that winning competing because you can teach you can teach somebody all that stuff but to be able to do it under the light at the right time to make the right. And it's not all the stuff that goes on in the gym it's all the stuff goes on at home as well. Right. Like I live a healthy lifestyle got to have you know at home life's got to be amazing to all that stuff comes in. Otherwise it fucks with you. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3519.12s)]
*  It does right. I truly believe it does. I think so too. So it's yes it's you know some of the some of the stuff you do it in a gym but it's also a lot of stuff you do at the house. And this is when. Yeah look at this timing bang. Oh my God it's beautiful. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3549.12s)]
*  And the walk off. Yeah Olivia cost says I'm so glad that the fight ended there because I didn't want to have to pull you back to go fight more and I was like you did. I would have came back and I would have finished it. I would have I would have came back like all right let's let's keep going. Like this. How did you know that he was completely done when you walked off. I mean it's such a it's a perfect knee. But like watching this lands. We got a stall on the Internet here. Yeah. So it goes down and you just knew you didn't even follow up. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3565.12s)]
*  I threw everything I had in any like I threw everything I had in it and I knew that it was it was it and if it wasn't if he got back up he got up he goes like even that fight like there's part where I shot and then he he defends to take down to so fucking long and he starts neaming ahead. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3595.12s)]
*  Right. And I'm like oh like oh shit oh shit in my mind. And then when he's switching over the dark side I'm not fucking done yet. I got up and then I started I kept on fighting. So if he was the same thing got up and goes I'm not done yet. I'm like perfect. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3611.88s)]
*  I still got more energy to give you. So that right hand was so perfect to the timing of that. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3624.7599999999998s)]
*  And then he on the fucking cheekbone. Yeah. It's a good fight. It was a beautiful fight. And how satisfying was that for you to come back from the first fight that you guys had. It was good. It was good. But [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3630.48s)]
*  That guy's facing the right. I think it's the matchmaker Rick. He's hilarious. For me after the after the first fight I had with him I went through like I think 2019 I think it was 2019 2020 was a huge like shift in my life you know that affected me differently and my mindset. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3642.4s)]
*  And so when I lost that first fight to him I was so wasn't mad about losing. I was mad about I put so much pressure on myself about being perfect. And it just drove me insane. Like everything I want to do is perfect. I still had that in me but [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3669.96s)]
*  In what way. What do you mean. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3686.92s)]
*  So I don't know like I felt like I remember being in the hotel room and we watched the fight and then I felt like it was just have to cope. So my my sister passed during [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3688.4s)]
*  I was getting ready for a fight. Right. This would kind of stem from so I was getting ready for a fight. My sister she she died and then seeing her pass. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3698.7200000000003s)]
*  And then seeing basically the end game of life. Right. Like being there and seeing her just like she's there and then seeing her go through the trauma and then her being gone and then seeing the traumatic how effect on my mom. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3705.76s)]
*  And after you know I remember when everything happened I was in the hospital I was like [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3719.84s)]
*  You guys need help clean up all this blood because I can I can I can help. And she goes honey that's okay. Just just go home. I was like [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3724.84s)]
*  I was like all right mom I love you. I mean if you need me go home. Start a ball and my wife's there. I mean that was a huge movement in my life. I was like that's fucking in game. Like doesn't matter what you've done before. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3729.88s)]
*  That's you gotta go peaceful you go you know traumatic right. So that happened. And that was and then it was pointing me I was like damn like I called Matt I said hey I'm not gonna be I was like hey I'm not gonna be in training today. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3742.88s)]
*  I gotta go bury my sister. Right. And I took a step back and I was like fuck man I'm always training for a fight. Always ready for a fight. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3755.12s)]
*  And my sister just died and I'm I can't go train because I got a barrier. But there was like weird shit on my mind. I was like I'm always getting ready for a fight. Always give me for a fight. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3761.84s)]
*  And then I went to fight won the world grand prix fast forward you're ready to fight Adrian. We go through Kobe 19 right. All the gyms are shut down our gym kind of like we got relocated. So there's only three of us training. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3770.68s)]
*  And then I fight Adriano and I was the game plan was there but I just felt like I wasn't. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3783.76s)]
*  Maddie said he after I came back from the knockout he was like you know when you left I wasn't comfortable where you're at. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3790.44s)]
*  Like when you left I was like you're just gonna have to fight through this you're gonna have to just get through it and then sitting in the hotel room and I was like why am I why am I putting the stress on myself. Why. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3796.96s)]
*  For what. And then. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3807.7200000000003s)]
*  That was like kind of like a snapping period then when I fought Rob Tang I was like everybody's so worried about winning and losing. Why. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3810.36s)]
*  Why. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3818.6800000000003s)]
*  Because you're gonna die someday. You're gonna die someday. Right. So why the fuck do you worry about winning and losing. Are you having fun. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Who cares if you're going to lose. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3819.64s)]
*  So I went there to fight him I was like all right. You know I said I told him I was like I'm not gonna fucking run like I'm an exchange. Like I don't care if he has a hard chain. I'm gonna go out there and give him my best. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3827.12s)]
*  And then there's ASAP Rocky said when has it ever been cool to knock somebody down. It's never been cool. Whoever made it cool to belittle somebody or whatever is not cool. Right. So that's always in the back of my head. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3835.8799999999997s)]
*  So when I fought Rob Tang and then I felt that success not success but I felt like I won the fight and everyone was like oh you did a good job. I was like thanks man. Appreciate it. You know. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3849.7599999999998s)]
*  Go back home take care of wife and kids and then went off by a drone the second time I was like we do the training camp. It was probably the toughest training camp but I started doing things different. Right. Like before I'm like I gotta be perfect. I can't I can't have any beer. I can't go watch concert. I gotta be strict. And I was like I think the last firing session after the a drone fight I was like once a concert had two beers had a fucking chicken sandwich. I'm like I need to enjoy my life because eventually I'm going to die. Right. And I don't want to be in my deathbed. I was like man I was so strict and I was like I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. I'm [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3857.84s)]
*  gonna die. I'm gonna die. I don't deserve to be in a fight taking business and all that stuff. I want to enjoy my life. And so that right there from that traumatic thing in my life just shift my my whole perspective like on my birthday August 13th I [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3887.84s)]
*  was my wife is like We didn't get you any alcohol. We just got you know all water. And I was like No. Give me a fucking glass of champagne like I'm 30. I'm 36 years old. Like I'm doing this for fucking. If I if I train eight weeks and I can have one [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3901.92s)]
*  one fucking beer and it's gonna change my outcome of winning this fight then I [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3912.72s)]
*  don't deserve to win the fight I guess so it is what it is so I feel like that [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3916.18s)]
*  that whole mindset is just made me a better a better athlete better fighter [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3920.12s)]
*  because it's really some pressure from you pressure of being perfect right and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3924.6s)]
*  that's how it is like I remember one day I was like I just grappled that new wave [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3928.54s)]
*  right and I was grabbing a kid who was 18 years old and he was fucking working [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3932.14s)]

*  now and that's been making me... Randy Cote d'Or said that once to me yeah he was [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3964.8399999999997s)]
*  talking about fighting and winning he's like so many people put so much pressure [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3969.54s)]
*  on winning he's like he goes you do your best yeah he goes you're trying to win [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=3974.02s)]

*  so when you went over to one FC like how do they pay over there they pick it is [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4019.34s)]
*  it comparable to the UFC is it better everybody's contracts different [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4025.26s)]

*  fought Chris Cariasso I made fuck I don't know I made let's say I made [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4045.26s)]
*  $150,000 right and then I'll fight the next challenger [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4050.0600000000004s)]

*  because you always get your show and your win you're showing win right right [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4058.58s)]
*  your show might be 150k and your wins $50,000 bonus typically goes up by [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4063.14s)]
*  escalator of 3,000 10,000 15,000 it all depends right but then when I fought [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4068.26s)]
*  Chris Cariasso I made you know let's say 150,000 and then when I fought Kyuji [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4073.14s)]
*  Horiguchi I made less even though the pay it went up I still made less money [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4077.9s)]
*  why? I don't know why right because I didn't get pay-per-view points at the [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4082.18s)]
*  time right and so I was like I'm gonna tell Sean I was like hey Sean can I just [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4085.5s)]
*  fight that guy again because I made more money fighting Chris Cariasso than if I [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4088.9s)]
*  fought Kyuji Horiguchi and he goes no no you can't do that da da da da but did he [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4091.74s)]

*  it was I think it was probably because pay-per-view points bonus I have no idea [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4099.7s)]
*  right it just but I didn't get pay-per-view points so that's the biggest [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4104.98s)]
*  thing and then I remember when it came time for me to renegotiate my contract [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4109.22s)]
*  when I was after I beat Henry Seale the first time like I argued and I not [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4111.9400000000005s)]
*  argued but I fought for pay-per-view points right because that's where you [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4116.58s)]
*  start making that that next wealth right like shit John Jones has a fight what [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4119.9800000000005s)]

*  whatever that's gonna bring in 875,000 pay-per-view buys you make 350k and then [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4145.56s)]
*  you the pay-per-view structure is zero to two hundred zero dollars two to four [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4150.12s)]
*  a dollar four to six you know dollar fifty and six to eight you know two [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=4153.6s)]

*  understand this game and if I can understand what's holding me from [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5065.24s)]
*  passing his guard like I'll be passed I'll be trying to pass on his gun I was [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5070.24s)]
*  like why the fuck am I passed your guard yet like this is absolutely insane [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5072.88s)]

*  my brain and so when I get in my gi and I take my gi off whoo I'm cut through [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5083.56s)]
*  guard like butter baby it's it's just different like my and so when I fight [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5088.56s)]

*  of my damage from my back from spending so much more time in my gi grappling [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5101.4s)]
*  that makes sense it does in a way and it certainly makes you more defensively [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5107.04s)]
*  responsible yes defensive responsible but now as I as I sit back and watch [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5111.5599999999995s)]

*  but how can I be offensive off my back so I mean to have the mindset to be able [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5131.56s)]

*  he's on coumadin I believe it is which that one's reversible because he has a [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5803.7s)]
*  heart defect where his blood needs to be thin so um so the blood clot was from an [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5808.66s)]
*  impact it's fun me just kicking the shit out him in that fight over and over and [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5815.9s)]
*  over and over and he goes he said he was from the trauma and I was like really [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5819.54s)]
*  the one doc says oh it's cuz you're dehydrated now I'm like okay so every [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5823.86s)]
*  time after my fights like when I have my shins be bruised for that long for two [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5828.0199999999995s)]
*  to three weeks I'm like I'm gonna get ultrasound he goes doesn't hurt to get [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5831.82s)]
*  it just because you're susceptible to him because you've had him before in the [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5835.74s)]
*  past so but yeah I should have the only time you'd ever have a blood clot was [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5838.299999999999s)]
*  from that from that yeah there's only time and it's just from the trauma from [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5842.139999999999s)]
*  the trauma of kicking but in the shin yep but imagine that like you have that [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5846.179999999999s)]
*  it's like I can't do this forever right right right and so that's why I have to [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5850.58s)]
*  think outside the box like what do you do for recovery are you doing ice bath [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5854.3s)]
*  sauna are you doing so when I was fighting Rod Tang I was doing ice baths [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5858.66s)]
*  I was doing that and then I'll do the hot tub but then it got super cold my [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5864.5s)]
*  fucking ice bath froze so I couldn't use any more because we live in Washington [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5870.94s)]
*  so it just gets below 40 degrees so it's just a pick of ice so now honestly [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5875.42s)]
*  the only thing I do for recovery is just chill hang out the wife so it became a [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5880.5s)]
*  solid piece of ice one big solid ice like ice skating rink but you need to [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5884.54s)]
*  get one that doesn't get that cold I know I know I know I'm working on it so [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5889.22s)]
*  what kind of an ice bath was it was a trough it was a horse trowel oh so it [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5892.66s)]
*  was just like some primitive thing just primitive yeah okay just fill it up with [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5897.18s)]
*  fill it up with water and then climb in there it got to like I think the lowest [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5900.74s)]
*  we got it was like 47 degrees but that shouldn't freeze no that's what the [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5905.9s)]
*  lowest we got it but that was at a certain point in time in the winter time [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5910.0199999999995s)]
*  then it got lower the temperatures dropped even more like this is probably [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5912.62s)]
*  the most like barbaric thing not barbaric but it's like I put water in it [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5916.74s)]
*  and we get freezing temperatures and so I just stays cold so she's cold so it [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5921.139999999999s)]
*  actually got a big solid block of ice you're an elite professional athlete you [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5925.9s)]
*  need to get yourself a real cold plunge I know I know I'm sure someone will send [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5929.54s)]
*  you one I just bought a sauna from Costco though so we're gonna go yeah so [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5933.46s)]

*  mindset had to change because when you're getting ready to do a Muay Thai [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=5974.099999999999s)]

*  like fuck it nobody's nobody's on the vibe I'm just gonna just do my own thing and do the class [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6636.68s)]
*  but absolutely amazing no he's he's a genuinely unusual human being and it's like that you hear [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6642.08s)]
*  about people like that in movies yeah you know that are like so singularly focused and dedicated [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6650.08s)]
*  but it's rare to actually come across one in real life and it translates to his athletes like [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6657.4800000000005s)]
*  Gordon trains seven days a week I heard so 365 days a year fuck you Christmas fuck you New [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6662.12s)]
*  Year's fuck your birthday yeah yeah you're training when I asked him that I said you know [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6669.64s)]
*  cuz one of the coaches at Grappler Club asked me he goes hey can you pick their brain unlike [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6674.68s)]
*  what like their their training regimen is I was like sure and I asked him he says they train [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6679.96s)]
*  there's no days off they train three times a day two hour sessions one and the second the third [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6685.84s)]
*  session is intensity so he's like I believe in volume right a lot of volume and then a little [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6692.88s)]
*  bit intensity for pure grappling not mixed martial arts he was mixed martial arts you would just it's [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6699.400000000001s)]
*  not feasible you can't even do that right so I can kind of understand how they just grapple seven [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=6705.76s)]

*  have falter right is Henry is an amazing wrestler yeah right Olympic gold medalist gold medalist [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8088.74s)]
*  to Henry is probably the most disciplined person I've ever trained with what I mean by that is that [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8095.299999999999s)]
*  so Henry will look at somebody about okay where can I beat him that okay that's where I could beat [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8102.94s)]
*  him at we're not leaving there we're staying there like when we're talking about the Dominar [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8108.94s)]
*  Cruz fight he was like I'm gonna kick his fucking legs I'm not gonna stop I'm gonna kick his legs [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8112.9s)]
*  and we're watching he's doing his thing his stance and his faint faint low kick he's waiting [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8116.98s)]
*  waiting sometimes he will get off track but he'll reel himself back in back into fighting where [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8123.58s)]
*  me and him train it was good because he was like you're he goes you're a killer I was like what [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8130.3s)]
*  do you mean he goes you don't do anything we talked about like you're just you just want to [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8135.54s)]
*  push push push push I was like yes because he needs to be finished he needs to not die but I [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8139.660000000001s)]
*  wanted to pose my will on him like when I was gonna give me to fight Adriano he goes nobody [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8143.9400000000005s)]
*  kicks do not throw any body kicks kick his legs then the hands will come I guarantee you I [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8150.1s)]
*  guarantee right what's the first fucking thing I do when I fight Adriano body kick body kick [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8156.74s)]
*  and he can hear me says if you throw a body kick he's gonna catch it and take you down and sure [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8162.34s)]
*  enough he did that but that's where me and him thrive because we we question each other's skill [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8167.099999999999s)]
*  set on a humble way that makes sense right testing it right and so I think when he decides to come [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8173.54s)]
*  back he'll be fine against a Joe because he he's just fucking smart well he's a wizard you know [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8181.54s)]

*  champion yep yep remember he's sideways like yeah and now he's trying to transition he's trying [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8191.46s)]
*  to do he's changing it right he's always changing yes right and when I went after true with him [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8196.82s)]

*  time with Henry no very interesting we would probably it's funny we're training and then I [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8261.86s)]
*  did something I did like I was fully mounted and I instead of staying in the mountain and pounding a [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8267.060000000001s)]
*  guy out I went to triangle like I've stepped over and triangle them I went to my back and finish [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8272.02s)]
*  triangle he goes why did you do that I'm like why the fuck not he goes I would have stayed up top [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8277.380000000001s)]
*  and pound him I was like yeah but I just ended the fight who knows he could have turtled he could [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8281.78s)]
*  have did this so we bounce off each other no my dude like your grappling is so good that you need [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8285.140000000001s)]
*  to start finishing people with your submissions with submissions and he goes yeah but so we vibe [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8290.98s)]
*  off each other so we're gonna go I'm gonna go out there and train there's no one right way exactly [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8296.66s)]
*  and that was a biggest eye-opener I had when I train with them and for him to say he's like D [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8301.66s)]
*  he calls me Demetrius he goes Demetrius you're a high volume athlete your conditioning is off the [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8307.939999999999s)]
*  charts you're nine weeks out from your fight and you're already in shape he goes I'm worried about [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8315.039999999999s)]
*  you I'm like I'm fine like I'll take time off to where he is a he's worried about you peeking too [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8319.54s)]
*  early peeking too early but he is a precise he is move very little move move right hand right left [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8324.54s)]
*  kick right hand left hand smoke smoke right hand he's very precise what he does for me I'm just [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8334.34s)]
*  like flowing I'm flowing like one one two up six three two nine nine knee double leg takedown pass [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8339.7s)]
*  and he goes you can do that cuz you had the energy for it and I was like exactly so when he told me [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8345.46s)]
*  that it almost kind for me to come on my own as an athlete you know but he's a different frame than [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8350.019999999999s)]
*  you exactly he's cutting a lot of weight yeah he cut a lot of weight to make 25 and missed it a few [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8356.38s)]
*  times yes yes but at 35 he's a fucking beast yeah now I think he's walking when I was there he's [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8362.06s)]
*  probably at 165 now so he's always been he's got a little tortillas he's got he's got tortillas [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8368.1s)]
*  he's got that he's got that he's got that retirement body that's what that is but not quite [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8373.300000000001s)]
*  yeah he's in the usada pool I believe he's well so I'm super excited for him to come back if he [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8377.58s)]
*  does come back I'm very interested in that fight with him and Al Jermain that's a very interesting [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8384.78s)]
*  fight to me what he needs to do is just go out there control distance throw body kicks well he [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8388.54s)]
*  probably fucking won't cuz I mean you know he doesn't like to get taken down throw body kicks [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8394.4s)]
*  but throw things up the middle because Al Jermain the backpack big he's coming to his own but his [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8398.8s)]
*  stand-up is not rhythm he has no rhythm on his feet what do you mean so rhythm is like you know [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8404.96s)]
*  when I'm here Al Jermain is not like this he's not like he's not a rhythm it's like right it's not [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8411.08s)]
*  flow it's not like smooth like a kickboxer you know what I mean so it's kind of unorthodox right [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8419.68s)]
*  you watch Henry he's here he's moving it's very like he's dancing a little bit that makes sense so [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8425.92s)]
*  I'm not saying Al Jermain doesn't have rhythm I'm saying that his his his stand-up is a little more [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8433.12s)]
*  unorthodox which that's gonna give Henry problems when they fight he likes a lot of front kicks up [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8438.4s)]
*  the middle a lot of front kicks up the middle too which Henry will catch that and they can [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8444.12s)]
*  wrestle and we'll see who's a better wrestler but that's that's what I see when I when I break down [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8447.3s)]
*  that fight I'm like okay well I don't Al Jermain's stand-up is kind of like the last fight was very [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8452.779999999999s)]
*  unfortunate that TJ's shoulder was that fucked up going into the fight but I had heard that you know [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8458.859999999999s)]
*  I had heard his shoulders were fucked that shit has not changed since WC days you know how many [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8463.66s)]
*  times I've been in like line because every single time you fight their doctor checks you like raise [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8468.06s)]
*  your hands squeeze up and down left right check your shoulders your knees I remember I was getting ready to fight in WC and [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8473.5s)]
*  Antonio Buenueles fought with a broken hand he was like yeah I broke my fucking hand I gotta fight [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8479.98s)]
*  because when you fight you get that insurance right and you've you any damages you cure on fight night [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8484.7s)]
*  they cover it 100% with insurance so you know looking at as an athlete standpoint here's TJ [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8491.58s)]
*  he's 36 years old he's healthy he's like I don't know I'm gonna get another shot you know but his [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8497.1s)]
*  shoulders were fucked a long time ago oh yeah I know that I mean he's massive tears and his super [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8504.26s)]
*  spinatus well he said it tore it came out of his socket what 20 times 20 times in training camp but [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8509.7s)]
*  this is how we make our money like who is it Aaron Pico when he was fighting he was like don't stop [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8517.06s)]
*  this fight this how I make my fucking money right well he's trying to put it back in well exactly but [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8521.42s)]
*  think about that mindset this is how I make my money right right like I need to do whatever I can to make [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8526.419999999998s)]
*  that also he's just trying to win Aaron was still trying to win yeah absolutely he missed with a [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8531.419999999998s)]
*  left hook right and it just popped out who Aaron or I didn't see what happened that led to him the [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8535.5s)]
*  shorter pop out I just saw the highlight of him like like trying to get back in he's like don't stop [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8542.419999999998s)]
*  the fight that's how I make my money you know which is the truth so I think for TJ he was like this [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8546.98s)]
*  time make my money I got one opportunity I'm gonna put it back in and fight yeah I just think TJ's [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8553.02s)]
*  shoulders were already fucked up before the retirement before the time off from popping [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8558.300000000001s)]
*  hot oh really yeah no his shoulders been fucked forever see then once again you only can do this [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8564.5s)]
*  for so long yeah right so that's why I tell myself like you have you have to stop like at some point [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8569.9s)]
*  you have to stop like what is the biggest injury that you've ever had oh god um say shoulders like [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8576.62s)]
*  I still have problems with my shoulders just from years of wrestling shooting and filling all the [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8582.78s)]
*  weight mm-hmm going bigger guys because I'm the smallest guy in the gym I'll say my shoulders [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8587.980000000001s)]
*  shoulders are always fucked for for wrestlers yeah cuz you're carrying all that weight right and then [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8594.060000000001s)]
*  you know my main sparring partner is Matt you know so and he's like 170 with 170 175 then next down [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8599.300000000001s)]
*  on this is James he's like 165 and then Tony he's about 190 and then at my jujitsu place the [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8606.94s)]
*  closest person to my size is the women but I don't I grapple with women sometimes but then I'm [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8614.54s)]
*  grappling with the bigger guys so I'm always carrying a lot of that weight on my other reason [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8619.44s)]
*  for you to go down to Arizona that's one thing I say have bodies on bodies but now we have since [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8623.34s)]
*  we combined with Charlie's gym now we have Balal amazing 125er we have a hobby we have some smaller [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8628.9s)]
*  guys but when I went to Arizona holy fuck man there was a two-time national champion AJ Reese [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8637.18s)]
*  uh Gazam Rounds with him you had um Jose like there's probably like from 125 to 155 there's [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8644.02s)]
*  probably like maybe 30 guys don't you think that's better for your career yeah but it could also be [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8653.26s)]
*  horrible for my career because you didn't get injury prone why would you get injury prone if [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8658.02s)]
*  you're training with guys your size because you're training with bigger because you're you're you're [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8661.9s)]
*  competing with those guys all a single every single time I know what you're getting that like [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8665.699999999999s)]
*  if I'm competing with smaller guys I wouldn't have to carry the weight but you're also in a room full [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8669.1s)]
*  of fucking killers that are trying to make it to that next level so they're always testing themselves [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8672.74s)]
*  so you know how they say iron shepard's iron but also iron breaks iron right so how hard are they [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8675.619999999999s)]
*  training down there oh they go they go hard Henry does his own thing right here me way in what way [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8680.779999999999s)]
*  where Henry's like he doesn't train like when we were down there I was like are we gonna spar [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8686.34s)]
*  Henry he goes no I don't need to spar I don't I don't need I don't know I know what hell feels [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8691.5s)]
*  like I don't need to experience that so when Henry's not in training camp he's not training like if I [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8696.26s)]
*  was like hey here is do five rounds he'll get through it because he's mentally tough and you [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8702.06s)]
*  know he's a competitor but my condition will be way beyond his just because I'm like I did [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8706.26s)]
*  always in shape I did you know when I did new wave I beat me and Gary Graf were 20 minutes [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8712.98s)]
*  straight like non-stop just going back and forth back and forth and I was like we can do another [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8718.5s)]
*  20 if we want to right so Henry does his own thing to where the team does their own thing and I think [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8723.66s)]
*  the team they spar three days a week there and so I think if I trained with a whole bunch of [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8729.9s)]
*  killers like that I think I'll be injury prone I think I'll sustain more injuries in my career [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8734.98s)]
*  hmm or it could be wrong Joe maybe you're right yeah I don't know if you would be I mean I think [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8740.26s)]
*  if you're training with Henry he'd probably be very smart and how he approaches your because [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8746.66s)]
*  he would probably want to try to make you the best that he can make you yeah but I don't I like to [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8750.62s)]
*  train I like to push out of camp right where I don't know I don't know if he want if he does so [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8755.62s)]
*  that's that's what the difference I think would come down to when you were talking about his [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8761.44s)]
*  mindset we got a little bit there so his mindset he's like this he was like we sat down he goes if [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8764.92s)]
*  you were to fight John Jones what would you do I was like I'll get all over John Jones he goes you [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8771.16s)]
*  get all over John Jones I was like yeah I'll put the pressure on him I'll beat him up in the clinch [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8775.36s)]
*  I would take him down past his guard and submit him that's what I would do and he goes see I would [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8778.52s)]
*  do you know he has six different areas where he's like okay there's a balance you're sitting there [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8783.48s)]
*  you're not over committing or you're just chilling you're reacting then he has one that says commit [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8790.88s)]
*  you have to take risk right the risk management then there's another category where it's like [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8797.32s)]
*  counter so he has these six categories that he lives in and when he's looking at a person [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8802.519999999999s)]
*  he's gonna fight he'll sit there and look at his his categories in my okay do we take risk with [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8807.48s)]
*  this guy okay if we take risk with this guy here's the here's their pros here's the cons if we stay [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8813.24s)]
*  balanced we were neutral right here's a pros here's a cons and he sticks by that so in his whole [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8819.92s)]
*  training camp eight eight weeks it's by that book he does not deviate from that and when we're this [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8827.2s)]
*  is something he's developed on his own I believe he's developed on his own like when he showed me [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8834.4s)]
*  that like that's where we're two different animals right where it's like yes you he's like and then [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8838.56s)]
*  then he'll switch up he goes sometimes you have to take that risk in order to get that you know to [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8845.08s)]
*  get that reward but how much of that risk do you want to take how much you put your eggs in that [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8849.4s)]
*  basket or for me I'm like nope I'm going out there and I'm getting I'm getting I'm putting the pressure [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8854.279999999999s)]
*  I want to overwhelm you like with my skill set and my conditioning and once once you can't take [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8858.68s)]
*  the overwhelming then that's when you succumb to whatever it is you decide to you picked your [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8865.6s)]
*  poison and I'll make sure you die that way hmm so that's where we're different like when we sit [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8869.84s)]
*  there like I have the same mindset but I just I deviate off that path like I just like nope I'm [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8876.2s)]
*  going I'm gone I'm let me do my thing like when I'm sparring Matt like hey I want you to you know I [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8881.480000000001s)]

*  for you though yeah how could you argue that your approach is bad and that's a beautiful thing he [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=8921.64s)]

*  content on there it's been great so this is a girl I like how the the reverse angle that the [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9516.92s)]

*  they have a big thing I ever was complaining about poker because people will gamble on on [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9535.52s)]
*  Twitch and people were like don't it give me your money and I'll gamble it right and people are [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9540.56s)]
*  like there's some people like oh I that shouldn't be allowed there's some people say should be [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9545.36s)]
*  allowed so all that I was like you know what I think I'm a step away from twitch I'm gonna [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9548.640000000001s)]
*  try YouTube and so far YouTube has been great I've had a YouTube channel for a long time but [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9553.2s)]
*  I've been trying to not post any MMA content right like I don't want to have any mixed martial arts [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9559.400000000001s)]
*  just because I want to be known for something else besides mixed martial arts right so I love [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9565.400000000001s)]
*  YouTube because my channel is not dead when I'm not live I'm only monetizing when I'm live on [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9570.6s)]
*  Twitch oh I see so people can go to your channel watch the old videos watch the old videos and and [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9575.52s)]
*  the algorithm on YouTube is so much better than Twitch so if you're a small streamer on on Twitch [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9581.44s)]
*  you're never gonna get discovered it's very very very very hard so many people on just so many [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9587.640000000001s)]
*  people and there's no algorithm to pick you up I switched to YouTube and people like I didn't know [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9592.32s)]
*  you had a YouTube channel I didn't know you stream I'm like I'm a streamer for fucking nine years how [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9597.64s)]
*  do you not know I didn't stream and so then I read the comments and I comment back on the comments [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9602.0s)]
*  and the on the YouTube channel and then somebody says oh my god thank God for the algorithm cuz I [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9607.48s)]
*  would never find your channel when I see that I'm like ah I then about doing reaction video people [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9611.92s)]
*  send me stuff and I reacted to fake martial arts and I'll sit there and just laugh about it and get [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9617.119999999999s)]
*  my honest opinion about it and people love and eat it up and then it's still getting views and still [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9622.279999999999s)]
*  be able to get ad revenue and monetization on it so that's why I switched over to YouTube but it's [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9626.76s)]
*  all all for a passion like I don't I'm not relying on that money to be to pay my bills right so you're [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9631.12s)]
*  not thinking of it as a job like you know it's for fun doing with twitch for a while for twitch I was [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9637.36s)]
*  like if I want to be good I have to stream all the time YouTube is like I stream when I want to and [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9641.56s)]
*  then I do a couple reaction videos leave it up there and then when I'm not streaming right now [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9647.16s)]
*  people probably watching the YouTube video and be good that makes sense that makes sense yeah [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9651.8s)]
*  YouTube does have amazing algorithms yes if you're doing something like that it makes sense yeah the [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9656.519999999999s)]
*  problem with YouTube for what I do is there's a lot of censorship yes and especially when you [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9660.88s)]
*  talk about controversial things like you know COVID or anything along those lines like they'll [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9666.08s)]
*  they try to cancel you they try to cancel you Joe YouTube didn't they were there I mean they I [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9670.84s)]
*  was already gone I was already on Spotify which Spotify is pretty great about that stuff but if [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9675.8s)]
*  you're a person and you get hit with a strike like YouTube only has like three strikes yeah yeah [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9680.64s)]
*  and they'll pull your whole fucking channel that's the hardest thing so that's the hardest thing I've [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9685.8s)]
*  been trying to get around is me being on YouTube it's like you can't play music right or copyright [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9690.16s)]
*  right so my brother my long-lost brother I just met after 35 years on this planet oh man I don't [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9696.64s)]
*  know how much time we have but we have a whole I have I just met my father five years ago changing [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9704.56s)]

*  kind of like that so he's making me beats that way I can play music when I'm streaming on it's [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9733.720000000001s)]
*  not copyright it's not copyright I own the rights to it right so on Twitch you're allowed to play [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9738.560000000001s)]

*  monetization you're done right so Twitch you can play music and you still get monetized you can [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9752.32s)]
*  still monetize the stream itself so but yeah I like YouTube it's fun so far well it's beautiful [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_rlUox7Ctg&t=9757.0s)]
