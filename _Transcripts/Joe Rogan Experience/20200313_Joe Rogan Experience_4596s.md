# Joe Rogan Experience #1441 - Hugo Martin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzUuvAa2jPY)
*  2, 1, what's up dude, how are ya?
*  Good, how are you?
*  First of all, the game looks fucking- tell everybody who you are and what you do.
*  My name is Hugo Martin and I'm the game director on Doom Eternal.
*  Oh no! They're dragging us back in! Let me tell you something folks,
*  Hugo just played some of Doom Eternal, he showed us the game and ran through some of the first level, holy fuck.
*  God damn, it's so next level. It's so next level. Graphics, it's so next- everything about it.
*  Like the weapons, the demons, the way you kill them, it's the most violent thing I've ever seen in my life.
*  It's awesome.
*  It's so ridiculous. But it seems like it's okay because it's violence against demons.
*  Yeah, totally. And we work hard on that, like you never- there's no cursing.
*  I have three kids. There's no cursing, there's no sex.
*  I do want it to be something that my nine-year-old could play.
*  Don't you think it's kind of crazy that you could rip people's heads off, you could shove their arm down their throat,
*  you could cut them in half. That's fine. Just don't use any of those naughty words, kids.
*  Yes, because I was joking with something the other day. It's like when I'm with my kids,
*  like he's not gonna go up to somebody and like glory kill them.
*  Explain what a glory kill is, because it sounds too much like glory hole and people are gonna get really confused.
*  So in the game when you damage a demon enough, they will glow with like a shader on them,
*  and that means you can go in to do a melee finisher basically, which is like a melee attack,
*  and you'll get health from it, and there are these really, really cool animations.
*  And melee, we should explain, is like with your own hands.
*  You can rip them apart or cut them in half with a sword or a chainsaw.
*  Yes.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Like when my kids see that, they're not gonna do that, but when they hear someone use the F word,
*  they're like, oh, I could use that in everyday life, and that sucks.
*  It's a very interesting rationalization. I'm not buying it. But the game is awesome.
*  It would be cool if you had an R-rated mode that you had to like enter in your security number,
*  social security number or something, and it'll unlock it. It shows you're over 21.
*  That would be funny. That would be awesome.
*  Or over 18. I feel like over 18. Yeah. And then you just hire your brother.
*  Dude, get in here. I'll give you five bucks. Unlock this pitch.
*  That would be awesome.
*  It's cartoonish violence though. You could see it. It's very much like a cartoon.
*  Yeah. And again, you're killing monsters.
*  It's like walking dead when they spike them in the head.
*  You can't do that to a person on TV, but you could do it to a zombie.
*  And they're demons from hell. You're doing God's work.
*  You have to.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  You have to.
*  And we should explain that Doom was one of the very first 3D games.
*  It was Castle Wolfenstein, right? That was like the first one with id Software.
*  We've had Carmack in before. He's no longer with id Software.
*  But who is... is Willit still there?
*  No, he's not there anymore.
*  God damn it. What about Hollingshead?
*  No.
*  What the fuck, bro? How's it id Software?
*  Marty Stratton.
*  Change the name. You got a bunch of new people running it.
*  Listen, whoever's running it, they're doing an amazing job because that game looks sick and I'm scared.
*  I'm scared I'm gonna get sucked into it.
*  It's awesome.
*  The game... first of all, the gameplay and then just the beginning sequence, the in-game like whole sequence,
*  looks like a CGI movie. It doesn't look like gameplay.
*  Like, remember when we used to play games and you used to have that opening scene,
*  there was like a video and then it would go to the game and the game was crude.
*  This game is exactly like the opening scene, which is so crazy.
*  No pre-rendered, that everything, those are the in-game assets. That's how good they are.
*  The team is like insane. The guys are true artists, craftsmen, you know, like they just go crazy on the details.
*  And when you zoom in with the camera for the cinematics, they completely hold up the rigging.
*  Like it's like a feature film. It's nuts.
*  Are you guys... there it is right now.
*  Let's play the... let's play the...
*  The old trailer.
*  This is the old trailer?
*  Yeah, this trailer's good.
*  Just play it for people.
*  This is humanity's chance to repent.
*  Against all the evil that hell can conjure.
*  And if you're just listening, you gotta see this on YouTube.
*  And if you're like, I'm a grown-up, I don't have time for this shit.
*  I have an IRA and a 401k and I have kids.
*  Me too, bitch. Me too.
*  Saving your people will not bring you peace.
*  Only make the burden of your... worse.
*  For millennia we have survived.
*  Made others sacrifice in the name of our prosperity.
*  Who are you? A human?
*  To defile our traditions.
*  Now, if you're just listening, this is just annoying music and noise.
*  But if you're watching, it looks fucking sick.
*  Watch this.
*  Oh.
*  And then it goes...
*  Bam! Right in the head.
*  Angels.
*  Oh, there's angels too?
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh, shit.
*  You see that?
*  Oh, shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Oh, shit.
*  So he's like the boss demon?
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  God damn, this looks good.
*  Doom Eternal.
*  It looked awesome.
*  I anticipate a massive waste of time for people.
*  320, so that's when it comes out?
*  Yeah.
*  That's nine days from now?
*  Yes.
*  Wow.
*  That guy, if you're Bruce Lee, that is your Chuck Norris.
*  Yeah, and you guys are gonna...
*  The whole scene actually, when you meet him, which is a little clip from that,
*  it's really inspired by that scene.
*  Is it Enter the Dragon or Return of the Dragon when he fights Chuck Norris?
*  I think it's Enter the Dragon.
*  Yes.
*  I think.
*  You know, like when they square off in the Coliseum.
*  He comes out and he says some badass shit.
*  You know, like, look at him and you're gonna...
*  Yeah, that's a fucking great scene.
*  That is a great scene.
*  Way of the Dragon.
*  Is it?
*  Way of the Dragon, yes.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Way of the Dragon.
*  Or for the Star Wars fans, we say like, it's like you're Obi-Wan and that's your Darth Maul.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I like the first analogy better.
*  He did a little bit more in our...
*  It feels like, I don't know, Star Wars has become too Disney-fied.
*  It doesn't really sync up with that.
*  That fight is badass though, between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul.
*  Yes.
*  Oh man, it's awesome.
*  Yeah, it's pretty badass.
*  That's before it went to shit.
*  The fights in the prequels were amazing.
*  Yes.
*  They were really good.
*  Yes.
*  I've watched the one against Obi-Wan and Anakin like a million times.
*  Like I love that one.
*  It's so good.
*  Like when they...
*  And the lava and shit and they just go off on each other and like...
*  George described it in an interview that it would be like you would be seeing Jedi at
*  their peak.
*  That really in the first three Star Wars films, they were not at their peak and then in the
*  prequels you would see them in their prime.
*  You know, like Hickson in his prime.
*  So like...
*  Right.
*  That's what's so cool about that fight.
*  They're just going off on each other.
*  Amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, what you guys have done is create something that's going to ruin people's lives.
*  I hope you're really excited about massive waste of time.
*  I mean, we were talking before the show about video games and the addictive quality of video
*  games.
*  I have a real problem.
*  I just can't play them that much.
*  Yes.
*  I can dip my toe in every now and then and then I shake my head and I got to go running
*  or something because otherwise it'll get the grip on me.
*  Yes.
*  They're too fun.
*  Like there's no movie that you're going to watch that gives you the kind of engagement
*  that your video game does.
*  Because you're like in the movie.
*  Yes.
*  And it looks like a fucking movie now.
*  And you see with the glory kills, like you are your own fight choreographer.
*  If you're sick of breaking the arm and shoving it in his head, then swing around from behind
*  and cut him in half.
*  You know, like do anything you want.
*  It's awesome.
*  Now as far as multiplayer, because I'm not really into playing games, the game game,
*  I'm into multiplayer.
*  So you, I promise if you play the single player, what is unique about our single player is
*  the same buzz that a multiplayer will give you because your opponents this time are the
*  AI and that opening level that's white belts.
*  You're messing with like easy dudes.
*  The later on it will continue to level up.
*  And as you saw, like that guy that comes out with the axe, like again, he is he is as tough
*  as you are.
*  So you will get the same feeling from the single player that you do from a multiplayer.
*  That's not really possible.
*  See, because what I like is duels.
*  I like like like in Quake Champions, I like playing duels.
*  You know, that's what's fun for me.
*  Like me and Jamie would get barbecued and would come here and we'd play for hours just
*  one on one.
*  You run around the map and collect your rocket launchers and your ammo and armor and shit
*  and just fuck each other up.
*  We have a multiplayer called Battle Mode that is fucking awesome.
*  Like it's really, really good.
*  And then is it like Quake multiplayer?
*  Like no, no, it's it's different.
*  It's very unique.
*  The last multiplayer we made was not super well received.
*  It was a really competent, good multiplayer, but it was that.
*  I was just doomed 2016's multiplayer experience, but it really wasn't innovative enough.
*  Like fans wanted to see us like do something new.
*  So we basically took the single player experience, that combat loop that you'll master.
*  And then we we give you a way to do it with your friends.
*  It's a 2v1.
*  So it'd be, you know, two of you guys versus one guy gets to be the slayer with all the
*  guns.
*  And it's really, really cool.
*  And then there's invasion.
*  So like you'll play the single player campaign and then someone can become a demon like Jamie
*  could become a demon and then invade you while you're playing.
*  You won't know where he is and he'll just come out and try to fuck with you.
*  Like it's really cool.
*  But is there any one on one multiplayer invasions kind of one on one.
*  But battle mode, the closest we come to the one on one is 2v1.
*  Oh, OK.
*  That's weird.
*  Why decide two versus one instead of one versus one?
*  It's just unique.
*  You know, it's it's the balance there.
*  No one demon can stand against the slayer.
*  You know, the doom guy is all powerful.
*  He's got all these, you know, he's right here.
*  He's got all the guns and the mods and he's got eight cars.
*  Bicep exposed.
*  It seems like a vulnerability.
*  It's like a kind of a badass.
*  Pretty much.
*  If someone comes on, cuts his fucking arm off, it seems like that's a good spot to hit.
*  His arms are like trees.
*  So like they're made out of jelly donuts.
*  They're very large.
*  That shit.
*  They are so big that in one scene he raises like a sword and the bicep just like is absurdly
*  huge.
*  But but that's cute, but it's still made out of meat.
*  That's true.
*  That's true.
*  I forgot what I was saying, but yes, you can compete.
*  Battle mode is really good.
*  You really like it.
*  Yeah, but why don't you have a one on one?
*  Because we just it didn't it just didn't work out that way.
*  Do you think you anticipate anything like that in the future?
*  Like an add on or?
*  You never know.
*  Like certainly we'll see.
*  But but we're really, really proud of this.
*  Like I think what you want to do is you got to innovate if you want to make something
*  that's really going to engage people like that.
*  The whole point is to like give them something to master that they've never seen before,
*  because if you're just asking me to master a new version of a thing that I already mastered,
*  sure, a lot of people would appreciate that.
*  But you're not really going to capture like a large audience.
*  So we really created something that was completely unique.
*  And so we're excited that now is there going to be a death match mode where like all of
*  us can get in a room and fuck each other up?
*  I know that.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Well, what are you doing?
*  We have quick champions for that.
*  I know.
*  We already play quick champions.
*  I want to play that.
*  I'm going to use those weapons.
*  Well, that guy like this is this the multiplayer?
*  This is the multiplayer.
*  Jesus Christ looks crazy.
*  It is nuts.
*  That dude, it's it's kind of based on a couple of core pillars of like we needed something
*  that had a lot of drama.
*  We wanted something that had a lot of pacing, like the variations and pacing in the match
*  and something with deep strategy.
*  So and was primarily innovative, like unlike anything, anything anybody had played before
*  and was from like it's a multiplayer for people who love Doom Eternal.
*  So play the Doom Eternal single player.
*  You'll you'll like this.
*  Right.
*  It looks so incredible.
*  It's fucking awesome.
*  The graphics are so off the charts.
*  I just want to play this right now.
*  I know.
*  I'm looking at this video.
*  Jamie's playing showing the video of this guy playing and it's just it looks incredible.
*  So he's he's the Slayer you're seeing through the Slayer right now and those two demons
*  that he's shooting with the numbers coming out of them.
*  Those are the other guys.
*  Now I don't think most people understand the incredible amount of work that's involved
*  in creating one of these things.
*  Yes.
*  When did you guys start on this?
*  About four years ago.
*  So it's been four years of steady work to make something like this happen.
*  And in nine days we're going to like give it to the world.
*  Release it.
*  Yes.
*  I'm like I'm shaking.
*  Oh my god.
*  I'm so nervous.
*  They just canceled E3.
*  Yes.
*  Everyone's scared of the goddamn coronavirus.
*  I know my wife says I'm going to be in quarantine at the house for two weeks when I come home.
*  Because you come here?
*  I don't think it needs to be two weeks.
*  I think it's four days as you start showing.
*  Look at you sniffling already.
*  I'm just nervous.
*  Psychosomatic.
*  They say that it's four days and you start exhibiting symptoms.
*  So okay.
*  I coughed at the airport and people looked at me like I felt I almost wanted to apologize.
*  I was just clearing my throat and I didn't cover my mouth and everybody was like.
*  Yeah it was.
*  I know everybody's on edge.
*  Yeah.
*  Meanwhile the Comedy Store was packed last night.
*  Dude we went to PAX East last week with the fans.
*  Like lines of fans.
*  And the beginning everybody was touching elbows.
*  That lasted like 20 minutes and we were just high fiving and hugging and stuff.
*  That's how it was at the store last night.
*  A couple guys were trying to give you knuckles and rub elbows.
*  I was like get the fuck out of here.
*  We all go down together.
*  Come on give me a hug.
*  Well they say I didn't watch that show yet with that guy that you had.
*  But 50 and up or something?
*  It's the real problem is people with respiratory issues, people who are overweight, and people
*  who are old.
*  Those are the real problems.
*  Unhealthy people.
*  That's the real issue.
*  That's going to be the real issue.
*  Although Sam Harris did know a guy who's a skier who is 50 who is apparently very healthy
*  and very fit and he is now on a ventilator and he was in Italy.
*  I don't know the specifics.
*  You know sometimes look I've got the flu before and I'm sure you have as well and sometimes
*  what happens is you're worn down from travel.
*  You're worn down maybe from drinking.
*  You're worn down from too much exercise and then it gets you.
*  And then if you're not like and this is just the common cold and apparently the common
*  cold is a type of coronavirus.
*  Google that.
*  Make sure that's true.
*  But I'm pretty I was reading up on coronaviruses last night.
*  I was like what?
*  Like SARS is a type of coronavirus.
*  Is this just here now forever?
*  Like this is a part of the world?
*  Like coronavirus?
*  Good question.
*  Well Michael Osterholm who wrote this book Deadliest Enemy and who was on Tuesday on
*  the podcast Tuesday.
*  He opened up a lot of people's eyes as to like what the issue is and what you can do
*  to prevent it.
*  But those wet markets that they have in China are just bananas man with the fucking bats
*  on the tables and coronavirus are large family viruses that cause illnesses ranging from
*  the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS or SARS.
*  A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
*  So zoonotic or zoonotic meaning they're transmitted between animals and people.
*  So what's happening is these fucking wet markets.
*  He was detailing how they have chickens that are in one cage and civets that are above
*  the chickens and the civets are shitting on the chickens and the chickens are eating the
*  civet shit and it's like it's just a perfect environment to create a disease that's going
*  to jump from one species to the next.
*  That is scary.
*  Yeah and he's like and many of them have jumped to humans.
*  I mean all the major whether it's avian flu that's from birds, swine flu obviously from
*  pigs they jump from farm animals or from these wet markets to people.
*  Yeah and they're not going to stop those wet markets.
*  So it's like I mean that's how people buy their food which is just crazy.
*  Have you ever seen the videos and pictures of what they look like over there?
*  No that seems scary though.
*  What do you think your game is scary?
*  You want to see what a bat looks like when it's laid out on a table?
*  Apparently bats are like a common thing to eat and bro when you see what a bat looks
*  like with its mouth open it looks like it belongs in your game.
*  That would be good.
*  Good reference.
*  We were looking at pictures of them yesterday and they have a table laid out and then even
*  on just on the raw concrete bats laid out with their mouth open.
*  They look cartoonish.
*  They don't even look real and they have no wings.
*  Yeah Jamie's oh my god and over there.
*  Look how big these bats are.
*  These are bats without wings.
*  I want to see.
*  Holy shit dude that looks like a dog.
*  They do look like dogs.
*  Unless those are dogs.
*  Those might be dogs.
*  Oh those are dogs bro.
*  Those are dogs.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Those are dogs.
*  Oh those are bats.
*  So those are bats.
*  So look at the teeth on the bats.
*  Yeah that's really.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at how they all have their mouths wide open like they're trying to bite you.
*  So like they die trying to kill you.
*  And they're going to cook those?
*  Yes.
*  That is how this disease got started.
*  Look at that guy smoking cigarettes.
*  Go back to him again.
*  Let me see a big picture of him.
*  He's triple stacking the behavior.
*  Stacks of bats smoking cigarettes.
*  They're eating bats.
*  That's crazy.
*  It's just nuts man.
*  But this is what happens.
*  We'll see these chickens stacked on top of each other.
*  When you have a billion people.
*  And look at that guy sleeping on top of that cage.
*  That should be in our game actually.
*  It should be.
*  Yeah if you're hungry you eat a bat.
*  You could glory kill that thing and get health.
*  That would be good.
*  But the stars came from bats as well.
*  So don't eat bats kids.
*  I won't.
*  But they have to because they're starving.
*  I mean that's one of the things that China's doing what they have to do.
*  There's too many people.
*  Not enough food.
*  And a lot of what they're eating is just we wouldn't imagine eating it.
*  Are you not traveling because of this?
*  I'm not changing shit.
*  Yeah.
*  That's my wife asked me a lot.
*  Like she was really concerned about me coming here.
*  And I was like dude we got to sell the game.
*  I just got back from Vegas and I was a little nervous while I was over there.
*  But I did everything normal.
*  I went to work out.
*  I ate.
*  I went to the fights which is 20,000 people at the T-Mobile arena all stuffed into this
*  one area.
*  And everybody was acting normal.
*  Everybody was high fiving and hugging.
*  And fighters.
*  I mean Jesus Christ you want to talk about people exposed.
*  Yeah.
*  They're sweating and they're half naked.
*  Tyson Fury is trying to lick that dude's blood.
*  I don't think he's ready.
*  That was before the big outbreak.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm worried about old people.
*  I'm worried about my parents for sure.
*  I'm worried about people who are overweight.
*  I have friends that are not healthy that maybe should lose some weight.
*  I'm worried about them.
*  I'm worried about people with respiratory problems.
*  A good friend of mine has a daughter who has cystic fibrosis.
*  And he canceled his tour.
*  Shout out to Everlast.
*  He canceled his tour because of that.
*  But he's got a real concern.
*  His daughter has a pretty serious lung condition.
*  That is really scary.
*  It's horrible.
*  Yeah.
*  And so look he's got no choice.
*  He has to stay home and play it safe.
*  I think a lot of people are going to do that.
*  It's going to be interesting to see how the government handles it.
*  Because one of the things about love or hate Trump, he's willing to do some shit that a
*  lot of people would think would be unpopular.
*  Like close down traffic.
*  Close down flights coming in from other countries that are infected that have high rates of
*  infection.
*  You know I mean I wonder what they're going to do.
*  And something I think something really radical has to be done to try to start to slow down
*  this fucking illness.
*  But I don't know what they can do honestly.
*  Are we waiting for it to, I've got to watch the show with this guy.
*  Are we waiting for it to go away?
*  Like I read a quote that like when the weather changes it'll stop or something.
*  That's horseshit.
*  Yeah.
*  Michael Osterholm set us straight on that.
*  That's nonsense.
*  He's like it's not going to have any effect on it.
*  What happens is it just runs through the population and people develop immune systems that can
*  handle it.
*  You develop an immunity once you catch it.
*  And for many people it's just going to be like a bad cold.
*  For many people it's going to be like you're coughing and you're and you just you just
*  try to get better.
*  Stay home, drink a lot of fluids, be healthy, do your best and eat healthy and then get
*  out and you're going to have an immunity to it.
*  And that's what's going to happen on the other end.
*  I saw one guy.
*  He had it and it was fairly mild and then they quarantined and he got over it.
*  He was getting over it and getting better and then they quarantined him with a bunch
*  of people that also had it and then he got it even worse.
*  Which is interesting because I was like I wonder how he got it again.
*  And I guess probably his immunity wasn't fully developed yet and then it just overwhelmed
*  his immune system because there was you know he's basically quarantined with a bunch of
*  other people that were really really sick.
*  But he got through it and he was talking about it and all these poor people that are stuck
*  on boats.
*  Oh my god.
*  It's crazy.
*  This is going to kill the cruise ship industry.
*  I guarantee you that.
*  We just went on vacation and I have to say traveling and like we went to this vacation
*  spot there's nobody there.
*  It's actually kind of nice.
*  Oh yeah.
*  You go to Hawaii right now?
*  Woo!
*  You got the whole beach to yourself.
*  We had everything to ourselves.
*  It was amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder.
*  I wonder how this is going to play out.
*  We go like you know you're even at our hotel eating at the buffets and stuff but like to
*  your point I'm just like fuck it what are we going to do?
*  They're closing down buffets.
*  It's one of the things they're doing in Vegas.
*  They're closing down buffets.
*  Those buffets are huge.
*  I haven't been to Vegas too many times but the one time I was there I had a pretty crazy
*  buffet.
*  Yeah I mean all you can eat just fucking pig out.
*  Some of those buffets.
*  But that's also how they do it on a lot of cruise ships.
*  They have buffets.
*  I only went on one cruise ship and by the end I wanted to throw up like oh my god.
*  Because the first day you're like the food's amazing.
*  It's so buttery gross.
*  It's like being stuck on an apartment building filled with drunks but you're all on the
*  roof and if you jump off the side you're definitely dead.
*  Yes and that's what it's like.
*  They're feeding you the fattiest grossest but tasty food.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  Oh if you're looking to get fat that's your move.
*  Some people just fuck it let's go all in but.
*  I just recently lost 20 pounds.
*  Did you?
*  Yeah.
*  What'd you do?
*  Well I was 226 and that was fun especially I mentioned earlier like doing Jiu Jitsu but
*  the my.
*  Fun just because you can pin people down easier.
*  Extra weight.
*  More weight to throw around I guess yeah.
*  Did you get tired easier though?
*  I did like there's definitely been benefits to losing weight that I actually really like
*  but my blood pressure and my cholesterol was really high so.
*  What did you do to lose the weight?
*  Well I went to a nutrition well really I gained that weight just from eating like an idiot.
*  I had really bad eating habits and I had no idea like I didn't know you weren't supposed
*  to eat a shit ton of pasta before you go to bed like.
*  You didn't know?
*  How old are you?
*  I'm 43 I don't know.
*  How do you not know that?
*  I make video games I don't know what's going on.
*  So like I know how to do glory kills.
*  Listen man I woke up this morning with acid reflux not really but like well it felt gross
*  because I ate two tins of sardines last night before I went to bed.
*  Yeah so I'm not smart either.
*  I went to a nutritionist and she just kind of coached me on like basic stuff and it was
*  remarkable how much weight I lost just by not being you know stupid.
*  You gotta just go to bed hungry.
*  Yes.
*  You're way better off going to bed hungry than eating a big meal before you go to bed
*  But I come home from the comedy store and it's late and no one's home.
*  I've just become an idiot.
*  I just start eating.
*  That's exact.
*  And then I go right to sleep.
*  I would crunch on the game and like be at the office late come home and told my wife
*  would make something amazing but I missed dinner and it's like I want to fucking eat
*  it looks awesome.
*  It's right there.
*  Yeah.
*  But that made me super fat and like it wasn't very but I was working out a lot so it was
*  actually and doing jujitsu so it was fun being of a larger size but I'm not supposed to
*  be that big like it wasn't good.
*  My numbers are all much better now.
*  That's great and you're just the nutritionist.
*  What did you change?
*  I basically I kept a food diary and she read it and just laughed.
*  She's like she's like you eat like you're 13.
*  I'm like I work on things for 13 year olds.
*  That's it pretty much.
*  And I just really when I was a kid it was like finish your food clean up your plate
*  Wipe up every last bit watching my dad.
*  He's Argentinian piles of fucking steak.
*  You know like I thought that's how people eat and I supposed to eat.
*  Yeah.
*  But not at like 11 o'clock at night I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  I just don't think you're supposed to eat and then go to sleep.
*  It's just not I didn't do a vegan thing.
*  I asked her that.
*  I was like should I not eat.
*  She's like no it's kind of the basic stuff.
*  I eat the little bit of all these food groups and I just eat in moderation.
*  So when I moved to Texas the Asian food scene there is amazing and really it's fucking amazing.
*  In Dallas.
*  Like what kind of Asian food.
*  Vietnamese food is outrageous.
*  The Taiwanese booth beef noodle beef noodle soup is fucking which is like Chinese ramen.
*  That's interesting that it's in Dallas.
*  Yeah I didn't know that either.
*  Dallas is culturally super diverse.
*  Dallas is a fucking great city.
*  It's awesome.
*  It is a great city.
*  I was just there two weeks ago.
*  The food is so good.
*  And I love it there.
*  If it's bad for you they have perfected it.
*  That's for sure.
*  In my first week there I went to the Texas fair and I had fried pumpkin pie with a scoop
*  of ice cream and hot chocolate and it was like the best fucking thing I've ever had
*  in my life.
*  But it's so bad for you.
*  And so just fried pumpkin pie.
*  It was good.
*  Then I'll play games.
*  No the whole fair is just fried stuff.
*  Well fairs are ridiculous.
*  Just going to a fair is ridiculous.
*  You're going to get fat just walking through the gates.
*  I did.
*  And then honestly the work was so intense.
*  By my own doing I was so into making doom.
*  But I had to balance it out.
*  Like I think I was reaching a milestone of learning how to eat better and sleep right.
*  I was just acting like I was still in college.
*  And how many hours a day were you guys working?
*  Because when I was friends with the id guys, this was like Quake 3 before it came out.
*  Way back then I was friends with those guys.
*  When I was doing gigs in Dallas I'd go to id studios and they'd show me all the stuff.
*  They told me yeah it was pretty awesome.
*  I'm embarrassed that I'm coming here and I'm not good at Quake.
*  So I was like shit he's going to totally give you garbage.
*  No it's okay.
*  But you play with a controller.
*  We should tell people you play with an Xbox controller which is quite embarrassing.
*  Well I'm pretty good with it though.
*  But how do you not use a mouse and keyboard?
*  I do sometimes.
*  But that's probably why you're not good at Quake.
*  Well I Quake, Jamie and I were bonding over this.
*  When Quake came out I was in art school and everybody was using Apple products.
*  Like literally no one I knew had a PC.
*  Like one dude in a dorm had a PC and you'd go there and he'd turn on Doom and you're
*  like holy shit this is crazy.
*  But like I was like an Apple guy hardcore so I just missed it.
*  But I play now and I'm okay.
*  I like playing certain games you have to play, you know mouse and keyboard, like PUBG and
*  stuff like that.
*  Jamie are our computers updated?
*  Is everything updated?
*  We are ready to go.
*  We're ready to go.
*  We'll play afterwards.
*  No I'm not very good at all.
*  Come on man.
*  You're a fucking, you work in the game industry.
*  I do.
*  You have to play a little.
*  You can't say I'm not going to play because I'm not good.
*  No I will.
*  Then you're saying to all these kids out there that are not good don't even start.
*  Oh no I will totally play.
*  We didn't make Quake Champions that was made by another team.
*  Well they did an awesome job.
*  They did do an awesome job.
*  Everything that comes out of id is always going to have a certain level of quality.
*  So it's a different team at id that made Quake Champions?
*  Yes it was outsourced, managed by Tim Willis and then outsourced to I believe Sabre.
*  So is Willis with them now?
*  Where is Willis?
*  Willis I believe is with them but I'm going to probably get that one.
*  Shout out to Tim.
*  How are you buddy?
*  I haven't seen that guy in forever.
*  And he left a couple months ago I think.
*  But he's retired?
*  Drinking a lot of times on the beach?
*  He's with them now.
*  Oh okay.
*  Yeah like doing something awesome.
*  I don't know.
*  Can't tell us.
*  I don't even know to be honest.
*  I just head down making doom.
*  I get it.
*  So how many days a week are you guys working?
*  When you're in crunch time are you working six, seven days a week on this thing?
*  It's not really crunch.
*  It's funny.
*  I prepared for this interview.
*  I watched all your video game interviews and I know that crunch comes up a lot.
*  But like the, this is going to sound hokey.
*  It's like a lifestyle.
*  Like I live and breathe this.
*  No one makes me stay at the office.
*  And even when I come home I see my kids, I do my thing and then I just do research.
*  Like it sounds ridiculous.
*  Not unlike my diet but like my research is that of a 13 year old.
*  Like I play fucking video games and read comic books and just engross myself in pop culture
*  because essentially what we do is make pop culture content for, that's pop culture content.
*  You know?
*  That didn't make sense.
*  No it makes sense.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  I have to like, you know, ingest a ton of it which means that it's 24-7.
*  I mean I get up really early.
*  I try to do the exercise thing.
*  I couldn't really fit in going to do any kind of training or anything in the afternoons
*  because it was just family and stuff.
*  So I try to do that in the mornings and then I come home and put the kids to school and
*  then I have like about two hours where the house is empty and I'll just play games.
*  So you're training real early then?
*  I do, it's horrible but I do the 6am one which is fucking holy shit dude.
*  So you're up at 5, shove something in your mouth?
*  No, not anything.
*  I made that mistake.
*  I drank a protein shake once before training.
*  That was a fucking disaster.
*  Holy shit.
*  So I don't need anything.
*  I drink water.
*  I didn't even know what the hell I was doing.
*  Again, I knew nothing of nutrition.
*  So I was like, it's 5.30 and I gotta be healthy.
*  I'm gonna drink this.
*  Yeah, you can't train.
*  Neon belly, I'm like dude, we're gonna have a serious fucking problem in like two seconds.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's the same thing with yoga.
*  Hot yoga, I've tried to do it after breakfast.
*  You literally can't do it.
*  I actually, I'm tired too.
*  So I'm pretty much just water.
*  It's only an hour so I can kind of get through it.
*  I don't know if this BCAs are helping or not but I sometimes put that in my water just
*  because other people-
*  BCAs, branched chain, amino acids.
*  Is that good?
*  Yes, yes, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Good before you train and after you train.
*  Yeah.
*  Depending upon who you ask, there's different protocols.
*  Just for a little extra juice.
*  I don't know.
*  Like to help, because I get a lot of muscle strains.
*  So I would-
*  Strains?
*  Yeah, like in my calves and stuff.
*  Like cramps, is that what you're saying?
*  I guess.
*  You take it in your electrolytes?
*  They're going away because I'm hydrating.
*  That was another thing the nutritionist said was that I was probably dehydrated way more
*  than I realized.
*  So I'm drinking water and it's actually working.
*  Like I actually feel like I'm getting less of those and I'm also hungry less.
*  One of her things was that probably some of what my cravings are for food is that I'm
*  actually thirsty.
*  So now I like chug a big glass of water and the cravings do kind of- those 11 o'clock
*  cravings kind of subside a little bit.
*  But yes, I try to do it in the mornings.
*  It's just super, super rough.
*  Yeah, over the last couple of weeks, last week in particular, I've been drinking a shitload
*  of water.
*  Just a shit.
*  Like last night at the comic store, I must have drank seven bottles of water, which is
*  great until I got home.
*  I got up to pee three times in the middle of the night last night.
*  I'm like, fuck.
*  I'd wake up, it's like three in the morning, like, God damn it.
*  Can I hold it in?
*  No.
*  Shit.
*  I just kept doing it, man.
*  Three times I got up to pee.
*  So you would agree that just- I mean, obviously, right, just drinking shit-
*  Drink a shit ton of water.
*  But I believe in electrolytes.
*  I think electrolytes are very important and I think you should find a good company that
*  sells electrolytes so you can pour into your water and will make a difference.
*  Do you have one that you would recommend?
*  I use Liquid IV.
*  It's a sponsor of the podcast, just for full disclosure.
*  But I actually enjoy it.
*  And even if it wasn't a sponsor, I would absolutely use it.
*  It tastes good.
*  You pour it in there.
*  It's got like salt, a little bit of sugar, and a lot of electrolytes and it's just fucking
*  really good for you.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's supposed to rehydrate you twice as fast as water itself.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It's twice as well as water itself.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  So I pour one of those into a bottle.
*  I like to do that before I work out.
*  It's also something that gives you a little bit of calories.
*  Not much, but-
*  Do you do anything during?
*  Like, is that-
*  Just water.
*  Just so the electrolyte stuff for the BCAs before or after, but not during?
*  I don't do it.
*  I mean, maybe I'm wrong about that, but I don't.
*  The most I ever do is if I'm training really hard.
*  If I'm doing something really crazy, then I'll drink something with electrolytes while
*  I'm working out, like a Gatorade or a Powerade or something like that, just to try to replenish
*  my glucose levels.
*  Is that good to drink Gatorade while you're doing exercise?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Because I feel like it is.
*  When I'm pretty exhausted, I have to be honest, they have little bottles of Gatorade.
*  I do get energy.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, there's a reason why athletes drink it.
*  They're not assholes.
*  That's true.
*  I don't know.
*  They're always drinking the- the logo's on the cup, but I'm like, is that some kind
*  of special powder?
*  The issue with things like Gatorade or Powerade or any of those sports drinks, air quotes,
*  is if you're not doing sports, you shouldn't be drinking them.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like if you're just laying around drinking Gatorade, there's a fuckload of sugar in that
*  shit.
*  But if you're running hills or if you're rocking with like a 50-pound backpack on and you're
*  goddamn exhausted, well, if you drink one of those things, it'll give you some energy
*  and it'll replenish some electrolytes and give your body some glucose.
*  There's some benefits to that stuff.
*  It's just when to use it and where and why you use it is what's important.
*  But there's definitely benefits to taking those sports drinks.
*  Your facility out there is fucking awesome.
*  It's pretty dope.
*  I love it.
*  The bats thing?
*  Oh, the clubs, club bells?
*  Yeah.
*  That's pretty crazy.
*  I've never done any kettlebells.
*  I need to though, because I don't know that my-
*  I can show you some of the stuff.
*  It's pretty easy.
*  If you have like a lightweight kettlebell, you could learn it.
*  You really should start with a lightweight once you don't hurt yourself.
*  Who's the guy who works for you?
*  He's got the beard.
*  I met him first.
*  Taylor?
*  Taylor, I think.
*  He has a black t-shirt on.
*  Jeff?
*  Yeah, Jeff.
*  And I shook his hand and I was like, my goodness.
*  I think you've been tossing around.
*  It's just corn fed.
*  Seriously, it was like-
*  He's a big old fella.
*  You've been doing something, dude.
*  Yeah, they're big fellas.
*  The great thing about kettlebells or club bells, those clubs, is that you're using your
*  whole body.
*  That's the thing about those things.
*  It actually enhances your athletic ability.
*  It enhances your ability to do sports, particularly jujitsu.
*  Things like Turkish get-ups, you ever do Turkish get-ups?
*  I was joking with my friend yesterday.
*  So no, I've seen them.
*  I think if you put the word Turkish in front of anything, it usually means it's pretty
*  gnarly.
*  Turkish sauna, Turkish bath.
*  Turkish prison.
*  Right.
*  Like, Midnight Express.
*  Wasn't that a Turkish prison?
*  Yes.
*  That is the magnifier for everything.
*  Turkish.
*  That's funny.
*  Turkish wrestling.
*  Yeah, true.
*  But I've never done one, but they look pretty serious.
*  They're legit.
*  Turkish get-ups, one of my favorite exercises.
*  It's not romantic.
*  It doesn't give you big pecs.
*  That's what the one leg, like you have one leg out, one leg.
*  Well, you start off on your back.
*  You start off laying on your back.
*  You press the kettlebell up and then you sit up.
*  And then once you sit up, you get one leg under you and then you go up and then you
*  go all the way up, stand straight up and then drop all the way back down.
*  And you should watch a video.
*  Ideally, you should find a coach and have someone correct all your form so that you
*  have it down and then you can do it on your own.
*  But the beautiful thing about that is you could have a kettlebell and you sit in your
*  office and just for five minutes, just do Turkish get-ups for five minutes and do it
*  a couple of times a day and it'll change your body.
*  That's awesome.
*  It'll change your core strength and your shoulder strength and your shoulder stability because
*  you got this thing overhead at the end of it and then you're dropping it back down and
*  you're resting your body back down and starting all over again.
*  It's a very difficult exercise.
*  I think working with someone is what I need to do because at 43, I'm finding that I injure
*  myself because I'm not exercising correctly.
*  Clearly, I'm not doing anything correctly.
*  I'll try to do some extra stuff outside of training to work on things and it's always
*  something.
*  And then when I get something, it fucks everything up for months.
*  I did something on my bicep and I couldn't do half the shit I needed to do in the morning
*  in training.
*  It was a pain in the ass.
*  So actually, I'm not really doing anything anymore.
*  I do just some basic simple shit.
*  Basic simple shit is fine.
*  Just bodyweight squats, chin-ups, push-ups, stuff like that.
*  That's it.
*  All that stuff is real good for you.
*  The thing is you're doing something right because you got a purple belt.
*  Yes.
*  So congratulations on that.
*  Thank you.
*  But also, you're doing jiu-jitsu.
*  That's a fucking hard thing to do, man.
*  It's like, eat your body up.
*  I got to do something because when I wasn't doing it, I got the kids and the work because
*  it is a lifestyle, but it's also a lifestyle that involves sitting on your ass, staring
*  at a TV screen.
*  Yeah.
*  What kind of chairs do you guys sit in to keep from getting back pains?
*  I don't really sit that much.
*  Do you have standing desks?
*  No, I'm just walking the whole fucking time.
*  Just walking to this thing, walking to that thing.
*  And then we just have pretty basic desks, but a lot of people do standing desks for
*  sure.
*  And I like those a lot, too.
*  I don't have one.
*  Because again, I don't really sit anywhere specific.
*  I have an office, but I'm never in it.
*  You're always moving around talking to different people about this and that.
*  Which is good because when I sit for too long, my lower back, I got like a bulge in the lower
*  back area.
*  I don't know.
*  And if I sit too much, it kind of bugs me.
*  Everyone who does jiu-jitsu has something going on with their back.
*  Yeah, I'm a little worried about that because I found a thing that you get the kids and
*  before it, I was like, you know, roughhousing with them and you're fucking breathing heavy
*  and it's just like, shit, dude.
*  And so I'm like, what can I do?
*  I'm like, I don't fucking like basketball.
*  I think running sucks.
*  Like, I don't want to just work out.
*  Like, you know, so I did this and it became a fun, engaging way to get healthy.
*  It's a game.
*  You know, you're playing a game.
*  It's like it cleans up everything.
*  Like, I can't eat shitty food because I'm going to feel like shit on that.
*  So like, yeah, it had this ripple effect in my life that was fucking amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  And and and a really healthy pursuit.
*  But the back thing, is that guaranteed that like?
*  Well, there's things you can do to mitigate it.
*  And I'll show you some of the things that we have here.
*  A machine called the Reverse Hyper.
*  Unfortunately, this just came up in a podcast yesterday as well.
*  Reverse Hyper machine, which is a great machine for strengthening your lower back.
*  And then there's one of my sponsors is Teeter.
*  They make those inversion tables and they have this thing called the Dex.
*  And it's like you bend over.
*  It's a D-X-X.
*  Is that what it is?
*  Just one X.
*  And you bend over at the waist and it's just like decompresses your spine and relaxes everything.
*  To just set like afterwards.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Because I want to I want to keep doing it for health reasons.
*  Yeah, no, I found something that is a good add.
*  It adds something to my life in a healthy way.
*  Yeah, I love it.
*  It's awesome. But it does beat you up.
*  Are you know if fans are buts about it.
*  I've seen you wearing your gi in some pictures.
*  Are you wearing your gi again and training more with your gi?
*  Did you always train with your gi or like?
*  Well, I trained with the gi and no gi.
*  I have a black belt in both.
*  I know. But like I it seemed I could be completely wrong.
*  It seemed like you were doing a lot of no gi.
*  A lot of no gi. Yeah.
*  But lately it seems like you're wearing the gi again.
*  But I could be completely wrong.
*  No, I think both are good.
*  I think there's nothing wrong with the gi.
*  What the gi teaches you is defensive postures.
*  It teaches you defensive techniques better because you can't pull out of everything.
*  So you have to do everything with proper technique.
*  Because when everything gets slippery and snowy, you just pull out of stuff.
*  Sure. But you can't do that if someone has a hold of your sleeves
*  and they get their fist fully wrapped in there.
*  Like you're not getting out.
*  And then you're just going to get deeper in.
*  You got to use technique.
*  You got to use the proper defense.
*  Do you have a preference or just it's all good?
*  I think both are good.
*  I think both are good.
*  Look, if you live in a place where people are wearing winter coats,
*  learning how to fight with a gi is great.
*  Yeah. You know, you grab a coat.
*  I mean, a coat is like a weapon that a person is wearing on them.
*  You use their own code against them.
*  I saw a great podcast clip with you and Guy Ritchie.
*  And you were staring at his tie and you were like salivating because
*  yeah, like thing with ties.
*  I tell people that if you have a tie, you should have like a Velcro thing in the back.
*  Just take a nice tie, put it on, tighten it up and then snip the back
*  and then sew in some Velcro.
*  So it seals up like this so that if you could just
*  someone yanks on your neck, just pulls that tie off.
*  Yes, that's it.
*  Just put on paranoid.
*  But I mean, your collar itself, right?
*  Like, yeah, good shirt collar.
*  You could choke someone with that.
*  You know, you didn't Ezekiel choke with that.
*  I like the community leaves.
*  You could use your own sleeves.
*  You can mean you could collar choking someone.
*  One of those jokes with a good, like stiff dress shirt.
*  You can get in there pretty deep.
*  A collar choking somebody with a dress shirt on that would be pretty.
*  You totally could. Yeah.
*  But with a jacket, like a leather coat, that person's a dead man.
*  Like if you had a street fight with a judo player
*  and you're wearing a leather jacket, good luck.
*  Yeah. You're going to get thrown in your head.
*  Our head instructor does a lot of judo stuff and his fucking grip is.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  They have crazy core strength, too.
*  Those guys have crazy upper body and core strength because they're so used to just.
*  Yeah. Everything is throwing you in.
*  But you like when they're demoing and they grab your collar
*  and you're just like, what the fuck?
*  Like, I'll never get this off.
*  And strength. Yeah.
*  A lot of them, what they do is they take keys or towels
*  and they throw it over a chin up bar and they do chin ups
*  by just holding on to the towel or holding on to the gi.
*  There's a wiry like every muscle is like taught with those guys.
*  You know, like it's crazy.
*  Even if they look skinny, like you could like they grab a hold of you.
*  You're like, holy shit.
*  Well, you look at their hands and you see their knuckles.
*  Oh, my God. Flamed.
*  Every knuckle sticks out that far.
*  You see a lot of jujitsu guys.
*  That's the truth. Like the ears totally telltale sign.
*  Don't fuck with that guy.
*  But if the knuckles are fucked up, you should just do whatever that person says.
*  Have you seen Megaton Diaz's hands?
*  Dude, holy shit. They're like, I mean, see if you can find an image of Megaton Diaz.
*  Is that arthritis? Is that what? Yeah.
*  So is he like?
*  So he's in he's in pain.
*  Well, I want I don't know.
*  I mean, you'd have to ask him.
*  But goddamn, I do that.
*  That guy will rip your neck right off. Oh, my God.
*  One of them Steven Seagal movies.
*  They could do it for real. Like Roadhouse.
*  I was just going to say that, dude.
*  That's like one of my favorite movies.
*  Like that scene where he does that, that guy, that bad guy is fucking crazy.
*  Like he just I used to guys like you in prison.
*  I remember the kid being like, holy Jesus.
*  God, movie's so good in all the worst ways that it was Megaton Diaz's hands.
*  Yeah, his knuckles.
*  So that's just one image of him.
*  There's a bunch of images of him with his knuckles.
*  Yes. His hands are just gnarly.
*  And I mean, there's a lot of a lot of jujitsu guys like that.
*  You know, what is so it's been said a million times.
*  They are also the community around it is that's another part
*  that I really fell in love with, because it's it's like dad Jitsu where I go.
*  Like we all want to get in shape.
*  And there's younger guys who are really athletic and old.
*  We have a one woman who's 72 because she's her son is there.
*  And her son's a fucking beast.
*  And he fucking did this to me.
*  But the the it's just awesome.
*  Like we're all trying to get healthy and we're learning shit
*  and we're helping each other.
*  Like it's great.
*  That's fucking great, dude. I love it.
*  Yeah, it's an awesome way to exercise.
*  I'm wondering if one day they're going to be able to figure out
*  some sort of a virtual reality learning game.
*  That's one of the things that I talked with Carmack about.
*  And I was like, I see because Carmack has done some martial arts himself.
*  And I was like, I see he's actually very good at judo and jujitsu.
*  And he's really apparently he choked somebody out at the office once.
*  I think the person asked for it.
*  But there's some story of like they wanted to see
*  if John could do it and he was like, OK, and just like like a robot.
*  OK, I'll choke you out now. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I spoke. I worked.
*  I overlapped with him by like a month.
*  And he said one thing to me and it was pretty cool.
*  He told me not to put greats in the game because they don't look good.
*  And I was like, yes, sir. That will never happen.
*  Greats. It's something to do on like greats.
*  He would run on something with greats.
*  When you look at them at an angle, they like do all the tech guys right now
*  are like, Jesus, you go like it's very specific.
*  But yeah, he just told me not to do that.
*  And I was like, I will not.
*  That's all he told you. Yes. He was super nice.
*  You know, I didn't know. I know what to say to him.
*  You know, like I had no reason.
*  I don't want to bother. Look, that's me and him.
*  That is awesome. Yeah.
*  He is the dude's legit.
*  The founders of it, John Romero, that guy like,
*  I mean, I really feel like we're standing on the shoulders of geniuses
*  when we make this game like a lot of what makes do maternal good
*  is is what they did in their game, like the rocket.
*  Launcher is such a well balanced weapon in the original Doom game.
*  And we took a lot of inspiration from that.
*  And the fucking characters are so well designed, the pinky and the cacodemon
*  and the sounds they make.
*  The game still holds up to this day. It does.
*  Like straight fucking legit geniuses, even with the clunky old school graphics.
*  It's still very immersive.
*  It's it's actually adds to the charm, because when you look at it now,
*  it just looks like a fucked up Saturday morning cartoon.
*  Seriously, it's like something they would make on Adult Swim.
*  You know? Yeah.
*  Well, Quake One became a big hit even after Quake Two and Quake Three.
*  A lot of guys went back to Quake One.
*  Yeah, because it was like a faster game.
*  And it was like and a lot of times guys actually cut all the textures out anyway.
*  Yeah, so they could see everything. Yeah, which is really weird.
*  I just last year played through Quake One single player
*  and Quake Two single player campaign with mouse and keyboard.
*  Yes, you would be very proud.
*  But I didn't play the multiplayer.
*  But the I actually am going to just become awesome at Quake Champions.
*  Really? Let's start today.
*  I'm down.
*  Very often part of my research, like when I play is to I have to achieve.
*  I don't want to like I have to reach mastery in a game to understand
*  to find the fun part of the research that you have to do when you're designing a game
*  and when you play other games to remain to so that we understand
*  like how other games are working successfully or not,
*  is to play them long enough to achieve mastery.
*  So you really you feel that addiction.
*  You feel that engagement level and you're like, OK, I know how they did this.
*  I know I know what I'm feeling right now.
*  Do you bring in you take like professional gamers and bring them in
*  for consultation and say, how do you how do you feel about this?
*  Absolutely. We watched and certainly we talked to them.
*  But it's it's dangerous because if you so absolutely.
*  But it's kind of like, would you want Michael Jordan designing the next sports game?
*  Like it's kind of like he can tell you
*  it's sort of like the guy who builds the race car
*  might not be the best guy to drive it.
*  Hold on. Here's what's wrong with that analogy.
*  You're talking about Michael Jordan in a game.
*  I'm talking about game players.
*  So if you bring in game players to tell you about a game is a good idea.
*  Bring in Michael Jordan and tell you how to play a video game based on basketball.
*  Probably not the best idea.
*  No, definitely not. We do.
*  We talk to them. Absolutely.
*  But point I was making was just that like you could fall into a little bit of a trap.
*  It's absolutely part of the process.
*  It's the smart thing to do.
*  Again, like if you're building a race car, you go talk to race car drivers
*  and say, like, how does it feel?
*  What do you think? Like, well, this is loose.
*  That feels odd. OK, we'll go fix it.
*  So how does a game like Doom Eternal start?
*  Does it start? It starts with a meeting.
*  You say, hey, we are thinking about doing this.
*  What do you think?
*  And then how does it get the green light?
*  How does a game like that get going?
*  We have from the very beginning.
*  Yes, we have a green light.
*  I've been there for seven, eight years.
*  So what happens?
*  We have a green light process where we put together an overall idea.
*  Marty and myself, you know, work very closely.
*  Marty is the studio director and executive producer.
*  Shout out to Marty. He's awesome.
*  He's he's the boss. He is the shit.
*  So what you guys say, like someone comes up with a.
*  So what are we going to do for our next game? We talk like it's
*  you know, making games is fucking awesome.
*  Like it's it is. It's the fucking coolest.
*  Like I can't believe that this is my job.
*  Like, yes, that's what everyone wants.
*  There's you stick a dynamite and a crowbar wouldn't get rid of me
*  and fucking in software like I can't get enough of making doom games.
*  But you hit the jackpot.
*  It's like what people want to do for a living is do something where you go to work.
*  You I can't believe this is my job.
*  Oh, so that's why when I go to play and to do the work,
*  I'm like, I'm not fucking working.
*  Seriously, you know, like that's awesome.
*  So that which can get a little out of hand, I guess sometimes.
*  But the the in terms of like balance and like doing other things
*  and like get up and exercise or do something.
*  But yeah, me and Marty, we talk quite a bit.
*  And and it's it's it's commercial art.
*  You know, it's it's business and art and creativity coming together.
*  And we have a schedule and we have to work out the budgets and stuff like that.
*  But ultimately, we begin with like a conversation about like what it is we want to do.
*  We're talking all the time, he and I, about stuff.
*  And then we talk to other people on the team.
*  But essentially, it begins with the executive producer
*  and the director of the project getting together and talking.
*  Then we we work very closely with our publisher and you start to formulate a plan.
*  And we had a plan and a good one for Doom Eternal.
*  And it's cool because we just recently had a meeting with our publisher
*  where we were able to bring up some of the things that we talked about three years ago.
*  And they are working now, which is a good sign.
*  Like you are pivoting a lot during development, for sure.
*  Like, OK, that didn't work. Let's try something else.
*  And what do you base it on?
*  It didn't feel fun to do or it didn't look cool.
*  We call it just steering into things.
*  That feels good. Steer into that.
*  That feels good. Steer into that.
*  You're always steering into the fun.
*  Like you let the game tell you what it wants once there's enough of it on the table to,
*  to, you know, to judge.
*  So what are the first processes like when you say, OK, you got the green light.
*  It's time to make a game.
*  What's the first things that get done? Is it design?
*  Do you sort of design what the players look like?
*  Is it the coding?
*  Yeah, it's like everything.
*  I mean, they begin the engine, all the different process.
*  Is it a unique engine?
*  Are you using an existing engine?
*  And this is very good questions for Marty, the executive producer.
*  But yes, they they they begin making the engine based on what they want to do next
*  and the goals there. And that has to like the this is the engine of the race car.
*  And we're discussing the kind of race car we want to make.
*  So we should explain to people what we're talking about.
*  We're talking about a 3D engine.
*  Oftentimes, what happens is like, say,
*  another video game can license your 3D engine
*  and use it with different graphics to make other games.
*  And that's a common thing.
*  The 3D engine is what we're talking about, which is every game has a different feel.
*  It's like some people like when during the quick days,
*  some people were really into Unreal, right?
*  The member of that game, Epic Games.
*  And they were like, this game has a different engine.
*  I love the way this engine feels. Yes.
*  You know, because they all have different sort of car mechanics.
*  Made some good fucking engines. Yeah. Oh, my God.
*  He's a smart guy.
*  Well, he recognized the balance of speed to like like real world
*  physics versus this sort of cartoonish shit.
*  Like, what's what's the fun balance?
*  It seems like Quake three was like a really fun balance,
*  whereas Quake two is a little slower.
*  Quake one was way crazier, way faster, but was didn't look as cool.
*  What is your favorite?
*  Champions. That's awesome.
*  Champions is the best. Tim is happy. It's the best.
*  That's awesome. It's the best.
*  It's everything. It should be. Yeah.
*  It's everything in Quake, but ramped up.
*  I don't like all that stupid shit like when lizards spit on you and it's poison.
*  You run through it like that's weak.
*  But but the the weapons are really well balanced and the maps are amazing.
*  And the graphics are off the charts.
*  The graphics are so cool.
*  Like while you're playing it, you're like, what the fuck?
*  It's crazy. And the artists are so amazing.
*  I mean, the work they do is so inspiring.
*  That's the coolest thing.
*  Like you you love what you do. You love the medium that you work in.
*  I feel so fortunate because and I speak for all of us at the team.
*  We fucking love the type of game we make.
*  I mean, you just saw it, dude. It's so it's fucking absurd.
*  It's like an R rated psycho cartoon.
*  But it's not it's not mean spirited.
*  That's what I really like about it.
*  Like it's it's it's kind of it's cool. It's like fun.
*  It's fun. Fun.
*  That was actually our main focus.
*  Again, you're killing demons.
*  That's it. Fine. It's just like walking dead.
*  You're allowed to kill the zombies.
*  The whole feel bad.
*  The whole purpose is to make something we talk about quite a bit,
*  like the emotional response of the consumer, like how you feel when you play something.
*  And we want you to smile like certain games.
*  They want you to be scared, which is good.
*  Survival horror games.
*  I'm on I'm on my heels.
*  I'm like, oh, my God, you know what's around the corner in doom?
*  We want you on your toes smiling, like just fucking barreling forward.
*  Like, when am I going to murder next?
*  Like, where is it?
*  You know, and but it's it's it's it's frivolous and it's fun and it's junk food.
*  But as we say, there is quite a bit of nutritional content in there.
*  Like it's it's a smart game.
*  Is there any pushback against these kind of games?
*  Like when you guys produce a game like this or create a game like this?
*  Is there any where people are like, this is too violent.
*  This is awful.
*  This is not really because it's not against humans like we.
*  And it's not.
*  There's no agenda like it's not.
*  I guess, yeah, we don't really deal with that because you're murdering
*  cartoonish looking fucking demons, you know, and and do believe me,
*  like we take full advantage of that.
*  Like like I said, you straight up Steven Seagal, these motherfuckers right in the head.
*  Like it's awesome.
*  And I don't think you should say Steven Seagal anymore.
*  And definitely don't use it as a verb.
*  It's way more violent than any Seagal movie.
*  That is true.
*  But but like I always got a kick out of his hyper extending of the limbs.
*  Breaking of the arms.
*  Yeah.
*  And that one in particular, that glory kill to we were like, there's a there's a
*  there's one pose in the animation where you hold out his arm and he's like,
*  because that's like what guys always do.
*  What I'm holding out hope for is some sort of Oculus version
*  of Doom or Quake or something like that, where you have like a unidirectional
*  treadmill and you're locked into it.
*  You've seen those things, right?
*  Was it omnidirectional?
*  Is that what it's called?
*  Yeah. Omnidirectional treadmill.
*  There is Doom VFR, which is pretty cool.
*  Like they made it and it did really well, actually.
*  And yeah, yeah.
*  Where is it?
*  I love that.
*  Yeah.
*  VF.
*  Have you heard of it, Jamie?
*  I was telling him I have it, but I haven't not played it because it came in my little
*  cycle of like getting where I could stand up for a long period of time.
*  Oh, your back issue.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He broke his butt.
*  We kind of care.
*  We removed those things from the office.
*  The thing that he hurt himself on.
*  Oh, the hover boards.
*  Oh, my goodness.
*  Yeah.
*  So the one minute people are laughing.
*  Check this out.
*  Next minute, some dude's ankle is just straight fucking hanging off his legs.
*  So this is the VR version of Doom?
*  Yes, it is.
*  Oh, that's pretty goddamn good.
*  And so how are you moving around?
*  You're teleporting just like he.
*  Yeah.
*  But how are you walking?
*  I think that's it.
*  I think just teleport.
*  You stand still.
*  I didn't I didn't work on this.
*  So I don't know.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Do you know, Jamie?
*  Like, how are you going through all this?
*  There's a little line that shoots out.
*  That's like where you're teleporting to.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so you stay.
*  This is work.
*  You can't move.
*  I mean, that's how they had it.
*  That's this is a couple of years old now.
*  So they've figured out some new things.
*  Oh, OK.
*  And stuff.
*  Well, the graphics look dope.
*  But if you just teleporting to each spot and then standing still and punching people,
*  that's ridiculous.
*  There.
*  That's how you do it.
*  Huh?
*  And then you go forward.
*  Well, I'm not doing it justice to because I didn't work on this.
*  So I can really tell you how the movement.
*  Actually, it's obvious.
*  Pretty it's pretty obvious that that's what you do.
*  You're teleporting with that green bolt.
*  Have you ever you know what sandbox is?
*  Have you ever fucked with that?
*  No.
*  Sandbox VR?
*  No.
*  That's really cool.
*  There's there's a company in Woodland Hills or there's a studio in Woodland Hills.
*  And there's another one.
*  There's a couple of them around the L.A. area.
*  But anyway, you put a haptic feedback vest on.
*  You put a helmet, VR, everything, plastic guns.
*  And then you go and fight things.
*  And there's one where you go and shoot.
*  This one's great.
*  This one is called.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Something Mansion was it called.
*  So they have one of these in Texas.
*  Zombies.
*  Yeah, I want to do it.
*  It's the shit.
*  Yeah, that's really fun.
*  Rats come out.
*  You got to gun the rats down.
*  So you are in this room.
*  And like this is see, they keep cutting back for what what is actually happening
*  and what the people see.
*  When you're there live and you see it, it's fucking killer.
*  It's really cool.
*  That is awesome.
*  And they're getting better at these things.
*  They have like sort of the characters.
*  Cool. That's the boss that comes and gets you.
*  Deadwood Mansion. That's that one.
*  I love that one. That's awesome.
*  There's a Star Trek game.
*  There's there's quite a few of them.
*  I think they have four or five different little experiences that you can do.
*  That's awesome. Really, really fun.
*  I have a Star Wars one.
*  Perhaps the void has that.
*  Yeah, OK. Oh, that's right.
*  The void's different. Yeah, I've done the Star Wars one.
*  That's at Disneyland and Disneyland, downtown Disneyland.
*  Before you get to the park, you could go and do the void ride,
*  which is actually better than any of the rides in downtown Disney or in Disneyland itself.
*  Is that the one with the avatar flying the Necron or whatever the hell those things
*  are called in Avatar world when you're flying on the thing?
*  That is in Disney World.
*  OK, not Disneyland.
*  Disneyland is L.A. L.A. for land.
*  But Disney World in Orlando has this thing called Flights of Passage,
*  which is fucking amazing.
*  It's the greatest.
*  They're called absolutely the greatest ride.
*  Ecrons, I think. Yeah.
*  You ride one of those dragons in Avatar.
*  That's all incredible.
*  I would love to do a VR thing where you're like one of the colonial
*  Marines from Aliens 2 like running through.
*  That'd be fucking awesome.
*  And they're coming out. They're going to the goddamn walls.
*  Yeah, you could do something like that.
*  Hudson. That's my.
*  That's my hope for the future is that games are like that.
*  And you're actually going to be able to exercise doing that.
*  Because I think that if you had a game where you're in a warehouse
*  and you're actually running for your life, you know, and demons are chasing
*  you and shooting down things like your heart rate would be jacked.
*  You could do that for an hour and get a sick workout in and have an amazing good time.
*  That would be awesome.
*  You can get in great shape running from demons.
*  You would. I wouldn't have to get up so early in the fucking morning.
*  Think about this game.
*  If you could play this game, but you could play this game in a warehouse
*  where, you know, you have all of the boxes and all those stairs.
*  They're all real stairs and real boxes.
*  Yeah, you're running around this pre-designed map
*  and you're actually engaging with these VR demons with a haptic feedback.
*  So fucking glory killing them.
*  Yeah. Ripping out their parts.
*  You're really into this glory killing.
*  But the really problem with this calling it glory killing is it sounds too much like glory hole.
*  It really does.
*  And right, Jamie.
*  Yeah, they agree.
*  They have a new ride that got announced today for, I guess, out here at Disneyland.
*  The new Marvel Avengers campus is going to be opening up in the summer.
*  They have a Spider-Man ride where it sounds like you put on a 3D headset,
*  I think just goggles, and somehow they're tracking your hands.
*  So during the ride, you shoot things for points.
*  And then there's a spider web.
*  Then there's a leaderboard outside the ride for like weekly, daily
*  and monthly stuff so your family can get track to be like,
*  oh, we're the best at this ride.
*  Oh, you're going to get addicted.
*  That's how they get you.
*  The the that sounds so awesome.
*  The level of sophistication going on with the games,
*  whether you're mouse and keyboard or controller, though, it would be hard to achieve in VR.
*  I think VR offers like a very specific, unique and fucking amazing experience.
*  And I would I would just like separate the two.
*  Like, you know, when when when we're making VR games,
*  we're definitely trying to do something else, which is cool in and of itself in and of itself.
*  But there's like not only just in our game, but in a lot of games,
*  like there's just resource management.
*  There's like high level skill meta shit happening.
*  I mean, you know, you play fucking Quake.
*  So like, you know, that that's hard to reproduce in VR in certain ways,
*  at least at this time.
*  But but I think that's the thing.
*  Like they want it happens a lot in games where people want to take
*  how you feel or how a movie engages you and apply it to a game.
*  And I think it's like, let a game be its own.
*  Let a game be a game.
*  Let a movie be a movie.
*  Let VR be its own fucking experience.
*  Like that looks fucking awesome.
*  Like, yeah.
*  But yeah, if we just yeah.
*  So so still, though, yeah, I would love to kill, you know, Dean.
*  I we have the VR game.
*  I should just play it.
*  But what I what I'm saying is like if someone made a doom warehouse
*  where you guys take a 14000 square foot warehouse, just outfitted specifically
*  for doom, you got to line around the block of psychopaths
*  waiting to play that thing for one hour.
*  I mean, seriously, especially somewhere like Texas,
*  where there's a bunch of warehouses like you can find some warehouse district
*  where you can get three or four of them and set them up for different
*  maps in the game.
*  That'd be fucking awesome. God damn, man.
*  I mean, they're real close to being able to do something like that,
*  where it would be really accurate to where you could have like a laser
*  sight on your rifle and you can see things through your goggles.
*  And that'd be fucking bad ass.
*  Although it's the future.
*  It is the future.
*  Hugo, it's it's it's a lame.
*  I was not lame.
*  You know, Carmack can do anything he wants, but he's doing AI now.
*  Like he's not doing VR anymore.
*  I heard I heard he was just consulting with Oculus, but now he's he's pursuing
*  AI. Well, let's be honest, he's too smart.
*  He is. He's too smart.
*  He's he's from another planet.
*  Him and Elon Musk can get together and share notes.
*  Yes. Yes. They're both super wizards.
*  Yeah, totally. He's I mean, I'm sure he feels challenged by AI.
*  Yeah. And you know, he he likes a challenge.
*  He's a very interesting guy to talk to, too.
*  I really enjoy talking to him.
*  Yeah, he is awesome.
*  And you really think about what he's accomplished in the world of video games.
*  I mean, he's the Mac Daddy. Amazing.
*  Yeah, he is. He's the the guy who started it all.
*  Really, the if you enjoy 3D games, that's the guy.
*  That's why working at id Software.
*  And he totally is the guy.
*  And along with the rest of them, too, like Romero and those guys, like that group.
*  Fuck. That's you know him.
*  Do you know John Romero?
*  I've met him a couple of times.
*  You know, Dycatana game.
*  He took a lot of shit for that game.
*  That was a fun game. Yeah.
*  It took way too long.
*  And there was a lot of bugs in it and all that good stuff.
*  But, dude, I played it when it came out.
*  I was like, this game is fucking bad ass.
*  And yeah, I mean, that guy is all of them.
*  They're like the Beatles, you know.
*  It was like Dycatana was like the physics of Quake 1.
*  But with the graphics of that era.
*  See if you can find a video of a Dycatana in game.
*  It was a fun game.
*  And I was like, this might catch on.
*  But people were down on it before it ever came out.
*  There's so much shit talk about it because it took so long and cost so much money.
*  And they had these giant offices in Dallas with this huge penthouse.
*  Yeah. They're spending so much money.
*  I personally think they they some of the best work that they.
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  This game was made by.
*  That's a little dark.
*  Yeah, it's this is a this image right here is dark.
*  Yeah, this is not the best video in terms of like what you're able to see in game stuff.
*  Yeah, there was a lot of hype and certainly.
*  That is a mother other video because that's like so dark.
*  You can't see anything. Is that it?
*  I mean, it was hard to online.
*  Yeah. On the Internet, bringing up a bunch of other stuff.
*  Oh, yeah. I think the best work that they did was when they were all together.
*  Yes. Like keeping the band together.
*  Mm hmm. That honestly, it's making games is definitely a team sport.
*  And you got to have everybody working together really well if you want to pull it off.
*  You also have to have like division one pro athletes.
*  Oh, yeah. Pro, you know, I mean,
*  rock star division one's on a good idea.
*  Like if you're if you're going to make a game,
*  you need everybody to be the same level of dedication, same level of hard work.
*  This rock stars. Yeah.
*  One of the OK, this is it.
*  This is why they have a sword. I never saw this.
*  Usually it's like.
*  What is this?
*  I don't think this is the game, dude.
*  It's not it's not Katana. No, no, this is not it.
*  OK. It might be.
*  I mean, maybe it's a mod. I never saw it like that.
*  What I saw was a lot of cool rocket launchers.
*  Like this is one rocket launcher that would shoot and it would come out
*  like DNA strands. Sure. Sure.
*  The rocket was like two rockets would twist at the same time.
*  They go back and forth.
*  Yeah. This is what the game looked like.
*  It's just it's just really dark for some for whatever reason.
*  Huh? Maybe like some levels you get a sword.
*  I never saw it.
*  I never saw this either. This looks weird.
*  I think this is the game.
*  Yeah, I think so, too.
*  I've been fucking forever since I played it.
*  I know that Romero likes what we're making, which is a huge compliment.
*  What is he up to now?
*  I don't know. He lives in Ireland, I think.
*  What? Yeah, I think so.
*  And and but when I met him, he was a super nice guy.
*  I met Adrian Carmack at a bar in Texas, which was fucking awesome.
*  And and it was funny because he started telling me like,
*  well, if you guys are going to make it, you know, we were in production on Doom
*  Eternal is like, if you guys are going to make a Doom game,
*  here's what we thought we made Doom and everything he listed.
*  We were all like, that's what we think.
*  You know, like he's like, we just did stuff that made us laugh and made us smile.
*  Like, that's what we say.
*  You know, like it was cool. He was super nice.
*  So it to me, it software is kind of like Disney.
*  Like they invented a genre and we are part of the new generation there.
*  And we have a legacy to live up to.
*  Like, yeah, it's the it's a really special place to work.
*  I've got a tremendous amount of I don't want to say pressure, but
*  we're all motivated.
*  Yeah. Well, it's it's you know, you're working at the highest spot.
*  That's like if you go, I mean, if you think about it, it's like if it's rap,
*  you're at Death Bro Records.
*  You know, I mean, you're like at the highest spot.
*  And the coolest thing is like the type of games that they have always made.
*  Just they they they they are able to get away with things.
*  And a lot of mainstream AAA games struggle with just because of how violent it is.
*  I mean, they are like, again, it's it's Evil Dead 3 with a Transformers budget.
*  Like who the fuck gets to make that?
*  Like, you know, like we we those the shit you see, we spend a shitload of time
*  making that stuff like imagine.
*  Whereas like in a lot of situations I've been in, it's like, yeah, we want to cut
*  this dude in half. Like, I don't have a lot of money for that, dude.
*  So do it pretty fast.
*  You know, like we're like there are artists like craftsmen, you know,
*  working on the entrails like this looks pretty good.
*  And we're and literally the notes are like,
*  I need like the intestine to kind of like flap a little when you get the thing off,
*  you know, like and it's how do you know if you've crossed the line?
*  Is there is there ever been a time when you had a scene and people like dial that back?
*  We we actually tonally, you know, you say, how do you start the project?
*  It's it's kind of like there's a fair amount of brainstorming.
*  And the strength of any creative team is that is at least for a game is how you
*  brainstorm with each other.
*  It's the synergy in that room has to be good.
*  You got to be selfless.
*  You got to show up. You got to be willing to support other ideas,
*  other people's ideas as much as your own.
*  We have a fucking amazing group in that regard.
*  But tonally, we try to establish that that like, look, guys, we're not making saw.
*  We're not making hostile.
*  It's not malicious.
*  It's not meant to make you cringe.
*  And we actually cut together a little video of like what we thought violence wise
*  was inappropriate and tonally felt off.
*  And then we made another video of what felt right.
*  And that was Evil Dead 2 with like it's not a slow trickle of blood out of a sliced
*  open wrist. It is some dude's head came off.
*  And Hawaiian punch just starts fucking shooting out of his head.
*  You know, like that's really what it is.
*  Like it's cartoonish, you know, and it goes so far that you because the thing is
*  you do this so much so often.
*  I mean, you are murdering demons per minute.
*  Like, I don't know what it is, but it's fucking crazy.
*  If it was off putting and realistic and kind of like, oh, you'd be so turned off.
*  It'd be sick. Like you'd make you sick after a while.
*  But so kind of weird way of looking at it.
*  I don't think you're right.
*  What you're doing is like super gory and disgusting.
*  You think somehow or another that will make you less sick.
*  Well, it was more realistic and less bloody.
*  Oh, for sure. I mean, that's totally we could we could twist that where every one
*  of those is mean spirited and really off putting for sure.
*  I mean, I don't want you to sell me some PR stuff to sort of defend your game
*  against people that are anti-violence, because that's what it sounds like.
*  What you're doing is super bloody and disgusting and violent to say that somehow
*  or another that is less off putting than less gory is pretty.
*  It's a ridiculous argument.
*  I don't want you using it here or anywhere else.
*  Well, it's Joseph. It is not.
*  This is no PR. This is this is legit.
*  It sounds like you've been coached.
*  No, no, no, no. Like this is my message to the team.
*  I mean, sincerely, like, OK, we coach them.
*  Well, because they make the content.
*  So like think of this.
*  All right. I good. I like this because this is the fucking truth.
*  So you look at Saw, you look at torture porn, horror movies.
*  They're they're cutting Achilles tendons with a fucking X-Acto knife.
*  And the dude is screaming in pain.
*  And he's a person like this is gnarly shit.
*  He doesn't look like he's having a good time.
*  Like versus on Evil Dead 2 when you flop off the head of that one
*  grandma creature that comes up out of the basement and like fucking buckets
*  of blood start coming out of her head. Right.
*  People cartoonish.
*  So like it's it's critical.
*  Zero PR spin.
*  That is we have to believe that because, look,
*  your design story is going to be exposed to the to the consumer in two fucking seconds.
*  Like they can see through your bullshit in five seconds.
*  If they're like, dude, you're trying to sell.
*  No, like so we have to have an honest, good design story
*  that we can stand behind that is true.
*  And that that is the truth.
*  I mean, we basically looked at like cartoons and like make it over the top.
*  The animation. So every time here's a perfect example.
*  Every time you murder a caca demon, which is those flying balls, you pull out their eyeball.
*  What is it called? A caca? A caca demon.
*  A caca. What's the spell it?
*  C, A, C, CAC, CAC. Oh, CACO.
*  Don't you have kids? You have kids, right?
*  I do. I have three kids. Caca.
*  Well, you're saying caca demon. It's a poo poo demon.
*  Sure. The the the.
*  So every time you pull out his eyeball, you literally hear like a
*  I can't do it. But yeah, sound like a like a funny cartoony sound.
*  And that is absolutely intentional to take the edge off what you're doing,
*  because if it was more gruesome and they're like,
*  it's the Exorcist versus Evil Dead 2, those are tonally two completely different movies.
*  You know, House House was a movie that came out in the 80s that was inspired by Evil Dead.
*  That's like a fucking comedy.
*  I mean, it is a comedy and it's a horror comedy
*  versus the Exorcist, which is fucking amazing, fucking amazing.
*  But really very serious, you know,
*  and that's that's how we're able to do what we do.
*  OK, stop selling it.
*  I'm selling the violence thing. I get it.
*  I see what you're saying. What is this? A caca demon?
*  That's a caca demon. It's caca.
*  That's poo poo. It looks like poop.
*  Like if like if you had a demon shit, that's what it would look like.
*  Like, oh, no. Tearing you up on the way out.
*  What is that? An original one?
*  That is the original caca demon from the original doom.
*  Yes. Oh, cool.
*  So it's an updated version of that, but, you know, just more graphically intense.
*  Yes. So when you do something like this and you release this game,
*  obviously, there'll be patches and some upgrades and some different things
*  that you do. But how long how long do you work on this game
*  before you guys move on to the next thing?
*  We're already moving on to.
*  Well, I don't want to say the next thing.
*  That is a PR answer, because I'm not allowed to say that.
*  But the you have ideas already ideas, certainly.
*  And the pipe and DLC.
*  DLC is guaranteed.
*  Like, what is that?
*  Basically like a small episode of doom that we would sell.
*  Why is it called DLC?
*  Downloadable content, I believe, is what that sounds like.
*  You think that anyone would know what we're talking about?
*  I'm so used to.
*  Jamie would. Jamie would. But Jamie's a super nerd.
*  Yeah, I'm so used to the gaming convention to speak.
*  But yes, it is down.
*  Like it's like an episode.
*  Like we made the movie and now we're going to release like an HBO series of it.
*  Oh, OK. So you'll have this game
*  and then you'll have a bunch of other ones that are based off the same engine,
*  same characters, different journeys, different things that will come up.
*  Well, all centered around the doom guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But yeah, basically the adventures of doom guy.
*  And how long do you do that for before you move on to the next game?
*  It's hard to say, you know, certainly we're always kind of dual
*  tracking things and talking and, you know, always, you know,
*  because you never know when the cool idea is going to come along
*  and you're kind of jotting down notes.
*  I always have kind of my notepad out just thinking about stuff like as I'm
*  I mean, you never know when it's going to something cool.
*  You know, you're playing something or you see something or watch something.
*  So and then we keep those conversations going on the side and see how it goes.
*  So is there any do you guys like keep your eye open for like
*  where VR is headed and things like that and go?
*  Well, not yet. We're not ready for that yet.
*  But one day down the road, we'll have something like that.
*  Kind of a different again, like
*  where like it's sort of like with cars.
*  I went to school for automotive design.
*  And yeah, I went to art.
*  You went up in video games just because I love video games.
*  You know, the the training in automotive design art.
*  Have you ever been Art Center? No.
*  It's dude, you should fucking go. It's fucking where is it?
*  It's in Pasadena.
*  And it's OK. It's like the Harvard of design schools.
*  Like it's a man. They do cars there and products.
*  But yeah, the cars that they have on display, you know, the big clay
*  models about that big. They're fucking amazing and and really, really amazing place.
*  You know, the the the design process that you learn there, you can apply
*  to kind of anything.
*  I would say anything, but a lot of things, certainly a video game for sure,
*  because it's just kind of it's actually the questions you're asking,
*  which is like, how do you start from nothing to something, you know, like
*  that involves large groups of people.
*  And you kind of learn that there.
*  I forgot your original question.
*  But oh, yeah, no, it's like, you know, so I use a lot of car analogies
*  at the office quite a bit.
*  And and it's kind of like we make a race car.
*  And if VR is something else, that's like an SUV.
*  That's like just another kind of car.
*  So like we kind of perfected how to make race cars.
*  And it's been doing it since the 90s.
*  So like Doom Eternal is just another race car and a fleet.
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  I'm just thinking that as augmented reality and then virtual reality
*  become more and more
*  accessible to consumers, I'm wondering, you know, like where video games are headed.
*  I'm wondering if you if you think that's where they're headed
*  or if you think there's always going to be a place for them on an actual video game.
*  I think on an actual computer, rather, I think there'll always be a place
*  for them in the actual video game.
*  I think the the that's where my focus is.
*  Other people like our Mac are looking to see where well, not anymore,
*  but where video games were going to go next.
*  But I am fully focused on where they are now
*  and how to make what they are now better.
*  Well, listen, man, you guys did a fucking amazing job.
*  It looks really cool.
*  Thank you. Really fun.
*  And I'm sure people are going to waste massive chunks of their life
*  and get a tremendous amount of entertainment out of it.
*  I hope so.
*  Anything else to tell us?
*  We can go play now.
*  Oh, really? Yeah.
*  That quick champions. Yeah.
*  Anything else? I don't.
*  I don't think so. I don't know.
*  So it's out.
*  Oh, it's a it's a March, March 20th.
*  Yes. Doom Eternal coming out March 20th.
*  So not long, folks.
*  Get your sweaty little hands ready and we'll be available for PC,
*  Xbox, everywhere.
*  Yeah. All the platforms, everything, you know.
*  Absolutely. Yeah. All right.
*  Beautiful. Full tilt.
*  All right, man. Well, thanks for being here. Appreciate you.
*  Thank you very much. Thanks for doing what you do.
*  It's you've wasted a lot of people's time.
*  It's awesome. Thank you. Thank you very much.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  Is that OK?
