# Joe Rogan Experience #1370 - Brian Grazer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 24, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Zo_FTUNDBI)
*  All right, here we go. What's up, Brian? How are you?
*  Hey, good.
*  Thanks for being here, man. Appreciate it.
*  Yeah, I'm psyched about it.
*  I'm psyched about having you.
*  Yeah, I'm now adjusting to the sound.
*  Oh, in your ears?
*  Yeah, my ears and is it muffled? It has it all sounding.
*  Perfect. Sounds perfect.
*  All right, cool.
*  So we were just talking about your books and I said, let's save it. Let's save it for the podcast
*  because I wanted it to sound fresh. I don't want you to reset.
*  So tell me about, you wrote two books?
*  I wrote two books. And, you know, as you know, I'm a, you know, movie writer and a movie and
*  television producer.
*  To say it mildly. I mean, you made some fucking amazing movies.
*  Wow, thanks. Thanks, Joe.
*  My pleasure.
*  Yeah. And in all this, I think, you know, my whole life and whatever those stories are,
*  the movies are and the successes, I kind of think anyone that's really focused can do what I do. So
*  that was kind of the end product of the first book, which was, it was called A Curious Mind,
*  The Secret to a Bigger Life. And that book is really about, I mean, how much do you want to
*  know about it?
*  Everything. Whatever you want to tell me.
*  Okay. So basically, I couldn't read at all in elementary school. And it caused a lot of shame
*  and then a lot of trauma.
*  Did you have dyslexia?
*  I had dyslexia. Very, very, quite a cute dyslexia. And I think we're out in Woodland Hills,
*  which was the fancy part of the valley. I grew up in the flats of Sherman Oaks, actually, as a
*  little kid going to Riverside Drive Elementary School and then later to Nobel Junior High and
*  then later Chatsworth High School. And in elementary school, I couldn't read it all and
*  they didn't classify it as dyslexia. It was just you're slow, you're dumb, why can't you answer
*  this? And then you'd say, I can't read. And then that didn't make sense. It just didn't, none of
*  those things computed really that somebody couldn't actually read a word. And I really
*  couldn't read a word. So when you can't read a word, then you find ways to survive, cope,
*  and not have the teacher look you in the eyes and say, okay, Brian, come to the board and answer
*  this question, because you're never, it's just going to produce more shame because you're not,
*  you don't know the answer. It's not possible. So I found that as that went on for a little while,
*  for quite a while, around the fourth, fifth, sixth grade, I really looked at people. I really
*  looked them in the eyes to learn. And I found that by looking somebody in the eyes, you could engage,
*  I didn't know this then, but you engage their heart. If you're really doing it with sincerity
*  and interest, you can engage people and move them and evangelize things. Get people to like,
*  play on your team, or you play on their team. They pick you and stuff. Good things happen,
*  except the reading part. But it enabled me to learn a lot just by looking at people and talking
*  to people. And I had this one mentor, this little grandmother, her name was Sonia. And little Sonia,
*  she was like four, 10, I guess, you know. And she would always say to me, she'd see me once a week
*  minimally, always once a week. And she'd say, you're going all the way, you're going to make it big.
*  Think big, be big. And she had all these isms. Because half my mom's side of the family was
*  Jewish, my dad's side of the family is Catholic, the Jewish side, the grandmother was my mentor,
*  and the worst thing that really was the single person that I could kind of count on in life.
*  And she'd constantly tell me how things, I'd go great, you have a gift for gab, she'd say.
*  And every time she said, you're going to go all the way, I'm thinking there's like absolutely no
*  empirical evidence I'm going all the way anywhere, you know. Except my parents were always arguing,
*  let's put him back. The teacher, Ms. Steg, said, let's put him back. So I just wasn't going anywhere,
*  I didn't think. So that gave rise to me, gave rise to the fact that I thought the way I can really
*  learn a lot is have these kind of curiosity conversations. And once I graduated college,
*  I did this on a weekly basis and I still do it to this day, once a week. Sometimes once every two
*  weeks, but never more than once every two weeks. I never, I'm pretty militant, I'm extremely militant
*  about it. Like how do you do it? Like what do you mean? Well, what I do is I think about, it's often,
*  and I know you do something possibly similar to this, but my system would be, I bombard myself
*  with, now I can read, of course, and I was able to start to read like in high school.
*  Can you tell me how they fix that?
*  They couldn't fix it. It wasn't fixable.
*  How do you learn how to, dyslexia reverses words on you, right? It reverses the way you view letters?
*  Yeah. Well, initially as a kid, it scrambles the letters. Then when it gets better,
*  it reverses the words. And to this day, I still start on the right and go to the left. So it takes
*  like really thoughtful discipline to make sure I'm always starting on the left.
*  Do you mean with sentences or with words?
*  With the sentences.
*  With the sentences.
*  Really? So you'll start at the right end of the, you should read Hebrew or something, isn't that?
*  Isn't it go right to left?
*  Chinese or something.
*  Yeah, different languages do that, right?
*  Yeah, I guess they do. But incidentally, when you have dyslexia, it's very hard to learn other
*  languages. So.
*  I would imagine.
*  Very, very hard. So, but I can read and I bombard myself.
*  So how do you switch it around? Like when your brain is making you read right to left?
*  Yes. I started to learn, just create like an exercise, a discipline where I could,
*  like as in college, I was able to read, I could force myself to start on the left and go to the
*  right.
*  Is there a certain mechanism that's causing you to do right to left? Like do they know what the
*  cause of this is?
*  Not that I know of. Not that I know of. Probably something neurological and certainly genetic.
*  I mean, I have no genetic trace, but it has to be a letter within your genome, I have to get,
*  having to guess.
*  So you learned how to read, you learned how to figure it out, and then you said you have
*  these conversations at least once every two weeks. So how do you do this? Like what do you,
*  do you organize them? They're structured?
*  They're structured. They see, there's a randomness to them because often you have to,
*  it's not like getting on your show where everybody wants to be on the show.
*  I say that with a compliment of course, but I'm begging people because even though-
*  Sit down with you.
*  I'm begging them to sit down with me and I'm groveling and I'm calling assistants directly.
*  I still, I have three assistants, but I make all of my own phone calls, always. You know why?
*  Because I have this discipline of getting to know assistants and going,
*  hey, it's Brian, it's Richard around. And I just like, I do that.
*  That's so refreshing from a guy who's as successful as you are because so many times
*  when people get that successful, you insulate yourself with a bunch of other people who do
*  all the calls for you and open all the doors for you and you just kind of, you stay insulated and
*  more aloof.
*  Yeah. Well, thank you. Thanks. Well, I, yeah, they do, people do, I mean, look, there are
*  producers that are sort of, that are, you know, let's say we're in the same category, same ilk,
*  that just do it differently. I made a lot of deliberate choices through trial and error.
*  I saw, I went through the eighties where power guys had desks above the other chairs that are
*  on the other side. The power guys always had black lacquer furniture. They did all these
*  power things. And I thought I want artists to like me, relate to me. And I always did everything
*  to create a democratic environment because not that I was such a cool guy, but more like you just
*  get so much more out of a creative person by not intimidating them. And I just saw, you know, my
*  peers and sometimes often, you know, someone maybe a decade ahead of me, you know, I don't want to,
*  I'm so close to saying names, but just those sort of tough guys, you know. And I didn't think that
*  was effective. I just didn't think it was effective. And I wasn't making these really hardcore action
*  movies. I was doing movies that were, they're designed to ignite emotion and feeling. In fact,
*  even when I do public speaking, I say, oh, Brian Grazer, whatever they might say, but I always say,
*  I'm in the feelings business. I'm not a movie producer. I'm just, I'm in the feelings business
*  because I feel like that's what we want out of a cinematic experience for me, for the movies
*  I'm interested in doing or TV shows. So because I grew up loving those movies of the 70s and
*  I'm captivated by things that move me emotionally and elevate me emotionally.
*  So you make these phone calls and you arrange these conversations. So you arrange basically
*  a podcast that no one's listening to. That's exactly, I never thought of it in those words.
*  You should probably record them.
*  I, so I've done it for say 35 years.
*  Really? And you didn't record any of them?
*  The first 15 years, nothing. I didn't write really notes either. And then the second 10 years,
*  I would say 15 was nothing. I just did it because I felt like that could inhibit somebody or I felt
*  like I was trying to do these sort of down low in a way. Like I didn't want to commodify them,
*  you know, like industrialize my conversations. And I had friends go like, well, can we be part of it?
*  And I tried it once with a couple other guys during my thing and it fractionalized my attention.
*  What I found, the great thing about the conversations, the one-on-one with no one
*  else in the room, which that's all I do, again, I've tried it different ways, is it create,
*  what you're trying to do, I'm trying to do is like create the best date that Isaac Asimov ever had
*  or, I mean, I have so many people, just Margaret Thatcher. I'm trying to, like,
*  I'm trying to be, have no idea of time and space and I want them to have no idea of time and space.
*  Because that is like your best date. And I always think like, what is my best date with a girl,
*  for me, Brian, because my best date is I'm not even thinking about time and it just
*  becomes almost like a biochemical event. It's just things are evolving.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Brian And I felt like I could do this with many
*  Nobel laureates, with Sheldon Glasgow, who converted the four forces of nature to three.
*  And I brought his name up because, well, first of all, I knew that your show, you could do
*  whatever you want. And with Sheldon Glasgow, it's like I usually do an hour or two hours, but
*  I hung out with this guy, shut my whole day down for six hours.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Brian Just because I was so captivated by him and he talked about multiple subjects. So, basically,
*  I always got somebody that I'm really wanting to meet and it takes a year at least, or sometimes
*  years.
*  Pete Slauson To organize this.
*  Brian To get them to say yes or to be in the same city,
*  or be willing to say yes and meet, fly to New York or some other place.
*  Pete Slauson It sounds like you have figured out the benefit that I've experienced from having
*  podcasts and having these kinds of conversations, one-on-one conversations, but you did it just for
*  your own personal edification. It's kind of amazing. But I have gotten more out of talking
*  to people like this and it made me grow more as a person and made me understand more about
*  communication and how to talk to people than anything I've ever done in my whole life.
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Brian Because you don't normally have this completely unfiltered. It's one of the reasons
*  why I like headsets as well because it locks you in. It's like your volume of you talking is the
*  same level in my ears as it is in your ears. We're all on this one, it's not like there's
*  distance between us or in each other's ears. And we're talking, there's no phones, there's no
*  nothing, we're sitting across from each other. How would I ever organize this? I thought about that
*  with so many different people that I've had a chance to talk to. Like, how would I ever get
*  Sean Carroll, the astrophysicist, to sit down and just talk to me for three hours?
*  Pete Slauson You had to captivate him.
*  Brian I would never get him to do that. I would never get him to, hey, let's put headphones on
*  and you just tell me about stuff. Like, explain to me about, no one would ever do that.
*  Pete Slauson Agree.
*  Brian But because of this thing called the podcast, because I can share it with all the other people
*  that are listening, I've had this chance to have these kind of conversations. And it sounds like
*  you've done the same thing but without an audience.
*  Pete Slauson Exactly.
*  Brian That's really brilliant. It's a brilliant way that you've figured out that this is a great way
*  to expand your own understanding of people by being one on one with these brilliant folks.
*  Pete Slauson Yes, exactly. And maybe you do this too, but I've found,
*  I mean, I do meet a lot of people. I reach out to meet people that are, you know, expert. That's
*  many different things that I don't do, of course. But sometimes I just, I become really motivated
*  just to meet somebody because they're so uniquely committed to something. They're so obsessed.
*  Pete Slauson Yes.
*  Brian And I've even found that I've learned a lot from Uber drivers and baristas and stuff where
*  but I do reach out to meet, you know, people that have really had a very intense, committed to a
*  really intense journey and often have triumphed in it.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, that's very contagious.
*  Brian Yeah, it is.
*  Pete Slauson The kind of energy that those people exude.
*  Brian Yeah, it is. It's inspirational too, isn't it?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, yeah.
*  Brian Because like even, who was it? Josh, you might know this guy, Josh Wakenick.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Brian Okay, the guy that was the subject of searching for Bobby Fischer.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, the chess master.
*  Brian The chess master who now is like a martial art.
*  Pete Slauson Jiu-jitsu martial.
*  Brian Exactly. And he was able to like succeed in both templates or formats.
*  Yeah, did we say his last name right? Wakenz? Is that it?
*  Brian I thought it was Wait, I don't know.
*  Pete Slauson It's…
*  Brian Waitnick?
*  Brian He's a student under Marcelo Garcia.
*  Pete Slauson Exactly!
*  Brian One of the greatest Jiu-Jitsu masters of all time.
*  Brian That's right. He's very proud of that.
*  Brian He should be. He's amazing. Yeah, he's excellent. And Josh's, yeah, weight skin.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, weight skin. You have it right. Thank you very much.
*  Brian Want to get it right. But a brilliant,
*  brilliant guy. And he's amazing on, if you ever heard him on Tim Ferriss' podcast.
*  Brian I did.
*  Brian Excellent.
*  Brian Yeah.
*  Brian Excellent episode. I think he's done more than one episode, in fact.
*  Brian Yeah.
*  Brian So, your experience with him? What were you saying?
*  Brian No, I just thought like this guy, he's so committed to excellence. Like, it's just,
*  and it made me, like as you were just saying, made me think about that as a premise, like,
*  just complete commitment to excellence. Because I don't really think of it, you know, that,
*  you know, these sort of creative puzzles that way. Creative puzzle would be like, you know,
*  a movie or a TV show or a documentary and I could go on and, but you, okay. Jay-Z asked me,
*  because I knew Jay-Z because he was very obsessed with wanting to do the soundtrack to a movie
*  called American Gangster, which I produced.
*  Brian Great movie. Loved that movie.
*  Brian Did you think?
*  Brian Loved it.
*  Brian Oh, great. Thanks. I liked that one a lot, too. But so, and I said, as much, you know,
*  as impressive as I am with Jay-Z and his level of, you know, mastery himself, I said, look,
*  we've already done the entire score. I mean, you can't do it. It's been done. He said, well,
*  look, I feel a kinship to Frank Lucas, who was played by Denzel Washington, is a ends up being
*  a drug dealer, like the biggest heroin dealer in America at the time, and head of like his own
*  mafia that he creates. And so anyway, the bottom line is he feels this kinship to him. He wants
*  to do this. He's very dedicated. I say, it's already done as much as, you know, superstar you
*  are and how great you are. And he said, look, I will do a second album. I don't have to be the
*  primary album that's on the screen. I'll do a second album. And I said, but I only have three
*  weeks. He goes, I will do the whole thing in three weeks. And he did it. And I went and saw him. He
*  did the singing. He did the writing. He did, he engineered it. He did every single thing.
*  So the guy that's the king of hip hop, he goes to work. And I was really blown away because he's
*  still, you know, he has that grit in him. And it turned out to be like for real hip hop lovers,
*  they really liked this album. I guess it was. Everybody loves everything he does though.
*  Jay-Z put out something that was shit. He doesn't really, yeah. He's kind of brilliant, actually.
*  He's a brilliant marketer. He says things that are very insightful. So he wanted to do,
*  after that, we got to know each other. And then he said, hey, I'm going to do
*  a festival, a festival with 22 different artists and all different types. And it's going to be
*  in Love Park. And it's called, we're calling it Made in America. Would you produce it? And I said,
*  yeah. And I knew that Ron Howard could get a chance at directing it. And I thought it'd be
*  really good for Ron to be around Jay-Z. That's a good thing for him. He's got a good aura and the
*  right one for Ron. And I thought, well, so we joined him. And I said, what is this about?
*  You know, what's the premise? And he said, it's about democratization of music itself. There's
*  no record stores anymore. And the walls are down. There's the cross between hip hop and
*  trance music and all that stuff. And I thought that was kind of cool. And then I said, have you
*  ever seen this movie called, because it didn't have a story, this concert. Now, did you ever
*  see Amadeus? He goes, I've never seen Amadeus. And I said, well, it's about genius. And he asked
*  about it. And he goes, that's what the premise of this will be. And he immediately thought,
*  had this idea that it should be every artist, every human being has a little bit of genius in
*  them. And he made it very relatable. And that became the thesis of what this documentary became.
*  And he only had that like a week before we were shooting. So it was kind of remarkable.
*  Pete Slauson That's pretty remarkable.
*  Jay-Z Yeah.
*  So you've been doing this for 35 years and you haven't recorded any of these
*  conversations you've had with people?
*  Pete Slauson Okay. In the last 10 years, I've recorded some. And sometimes I do FaceTimes.
*  And they allow me to. Like Admiral William McRaven, who I really wanted to meet, you know,
*  the Navy SEAL that created SEAL Team Six and just recently sort of, doesn't speak out publicly,
*  but had a point of view about the president and the whole Oval Office and stuff like that.
*  And he's a really amazing guy. But I said, can I FaceTime you? Because that was the only way.
*  So if somebody can't meet with me, I now say, would you Skype with me or FaceTime? At the time
*  I started, the tool didn't exist.
*  Pete Slauson Right. So you would fly to them?
*  Jay-Z I'd fly to them.
*  Pete Slauson For these conversations?
*  Jay-Z Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson That's so amazing that you've had this commitment to do this.
*  Jay-Z I have this commitment. Yeah, I do. I feel it's really, yeah. It's important to my life.
*  And I just, it's like a hobby that you're completely committed to doing. And it's for me,
*  I'm a person that gets better. I can get better all the time. I'm open every minute of every day
*  for self-improvement. Like if you said, Brian, did you think, if you gave me a note about
*  this experience or something and you said, you know, you'd probably be better if you did it this
*  way. If I could integrate it or simulate it, I would then do it.
*  Pete Slauson Good for you. That's a beautiful attitude.
*  Jay-Z Well, I know how fallible I am.
*  Pete Slauson We all, all of us. If you're human,
*  if you think, yeah, it's just, that's part of being us.
*  Jay-Z Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jay-Z So you embrace that yourself too.
*  Pete Slauson Oh, yeah. Yeah, you have to. Constantly seeking self-improvement.
*  Jay-Z Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. The big problem is holding yourself
*  prisoner to the mistakes of the past. Don't do that. And just constantly looking to get
*  better at anything you're trying to do. And I think having these kinds of conversations,
*  like you're talking about, will make you a better, more thoughtful person too.
*  Jay-Z Yes.
*  Pete Slauson Because it gives you a level of communication
*  with human beings that it just, it's very rare in this world. Very rare that you get to sit down
*  across from someone. And sometimes I have these conversations with people where there's no one
*  around, like, you know, the back bar at the comedy store. We sit down with a buddy and we'll just
*  sit there. No one's around. Just, he and I will just shoot the shit for an hour and a half, two
*  hours. No one around. Just talking. And like, those are rare moments where you're not distracted,
*  where you could just talk about things, you have ideas and someone brings something up and you
*  consider it and then you add your own thing and they consider that. And then you just go back
*  and forth and you get a better understanding of each other.
*  Jay-Z Yeah. I agree with you. It's amazing that you're able to do it and get away with it.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Jay-Z I mean, see, we're both sounds like open-minded to,
*  as long as we're kind of disrupting our comfort zone, I think, and being open-minded to that,
*  you're then being open-minded to like, the value of human error.
*  Pete Slauson Yes. Oh yeah, the value of human error. That's a great way of putting it.
*  Jay-Z Because sometimes some of the, it's not exactly human error, but human error for sure,
*  but you know, it's often the thing you failed at or the ugly thing that happened that sticks
*  in your head and makes a difference in your life, makes you better.
*  Pete Slauson Fuel for improvement.
*  Jay-Z Yeah, fuel for improvement.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, the feeling that you get when you fail at things is very valuable
*  because even though it sucks and it feels terrible, it does force you to sort of recommit and
*  reconsider, first of all, reconsider the consequences for failure, the feeling that you get when
*  things don't go well, which is a terrible feeling, and then it also makes you aware of the commitment
*  that's necessary to not fail, to do well at things.
*  Jay-Z Yes, exactly. It's enlightening.
*  Pete Slauson Sure, yeah.
*  Jay-Z Because sometimes you think that's as far as, even if you feel like you've accrued all the
*  facts, you've been able to, sometimes you don't know that there's that, going back to Josh,
*  there's this extra level of excellence that exists there. There's still more room to go and
*  you realize, oh, I could fill in those inches. They can be filled in.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, well, something like what he did,
*  chess and also jiu-jitsu, there's so many levels to it. It's such a multi-faceted discipline.
*  There's so many different possible moves with both activities, chess and jiu-jitsu.
*  Jay-Z Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson And jiu-jitsu, there's the physical element as well,
*  which is a big part of it, physical fitness and then also mental conditioning and your ability to
*  stay on task even though your body's physically exhausted and then the discipline to make sure
*  that your body is conditioned so that it doesn't get physically exhausted as quickly or as easily.
*  Jay-Z Right.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I mean, that's a very intellectual
*  discipline that people don't consider. They think of physical things as being like meathead things
*  or grunt things, but there's actually a lot of mental stress and strength that's involved in
*  discipline that you need to have in order to get your body into a position where it can perform
*  like Josh's can on the mats. It's very hard mentally to do that because you have to have
*  all these battles where you want to quit, you want to give up early, you want to take a break,
*  you want to rest, you don't want to go today, but you know you should. All those things must
*  be overcome in order to achieve the level of excellence that he's achieved.
*  Yeah, and probably because you've done this yourself so you know what that feels like when
*  you said you don't want to get exhausted or get in touch. That probably takes a tremendous amount
*  of focus because you get exhausted when you're nervous, right? Because your heart beats faster,
*  you breathe less air, blah, blah, blah. That's when, you know, in like surfing or something,
*  that's when you can choke, you know. That's when you run out of air because you're so nervous and
*  you're scrambling around. But it's the guys that are relaxed, like outside you have Laird
*  Hamilton. He's so trained to be able to be under the water for I don't know how long he can do it.
*  Yeah, he's very, very accustomed to that kind of environment.
*  And it doesn't freak him out. He goes, okay, there's a very good chance I'm going to get
*  caught in the impact zone. I'm going to be taken under and he doesn't freak out. If he freaked out,
*  it would be a problem. Yeah, I mean, that's his business.
*  Business is riding the biggest waves. Yeah. Yeah. You got to be able to keep it together when that
*  water wall comes crashing down at your head. Yeah. So I have to imagine it's a different thing,
*  but in, you know, in Jiu-Jitsu or fighting that you've done, which I think you still do Jiu-Jitsu,
*  correct? Yeah. Those things, those factors, they're just different environments.
*  You don't necessarily get nervous with Jiu-Jitsu that much unless you're in a competition,
*  but what you do get is exhausted. It's very physically demanding. Yeah, I bet.
*  You get very, very tired and you really should be, the more conditioned you are physically,
*  like the more strength and conditioning routines you go through, the more your body is in shape,
*  the more you can perform. It's sort of like racing, right? With a race car, but you can actually add
*  horsepower to the race car through discipline and you can add better tires and you can add a more
*  supple suspension through thought and activity. Really? Yeah, through yoga and different kinds
*  of training. It's like, you know, like you're involved in this thing that's a physical thing,
*  but it's also a mental thing. In racing? No, no, no. In what? In Jiu-Jitsu. In Jiu-Jitsu,
*  yeah. So like your body is the race car, right? Yes, got it. Sorry. But through strength and
*  conditioning, you could actually add tires. Yes. You can actually add a bigger engine. Yeah,
*  yeah, I get it. It can do more. Yeah, that makes so much sense. Yeah, and through repetitive drills,
*  you actually can hone your neuromuscular system to the point where these grooves are cut,
*  so you know exactly how to turn and how to move when you're moving and you're doing Jiu-Jitsu,
*  and everything sort of goes and flows automatically. And that requires extreme
*  amounts of discipline. Yeah, I bet. I bet, yeah. I'm just imagining it as you say it.
*  Because I don't know that much about Jiu-Jitsu. I've gone to some fights, you know, some fights
*  that a friend of mine, Ari Emanuel. Oh yeah, okay, owns the UFC. The UFC guy, yeah. So he's
*  a really good friend and my daughter's obsessed with, she's obsessed with martial arts, Jiu-Jitsu.
*  She trains. It's not what she does for a living, but she trains and she loves the community of
*  people. Yes. She got injured, pretty seriously injured, and then she didn't want to be indulgent,
*  but I said, look, I'll pay for you to start back early and you can just do one-on-ones,
*  which, because she didn't want to. How'd she injure herself?
*  She got like choked off from the back. I don't know how that, and it-
*  Her neck?
*  Yeah, created a stroke in her- Whoa.
*  Yeah. Multiple strokes in her brain, but it didn't affect any part of her intellectual capacity, but
*  it was really, it was very serious. So she got caught in a rear naked choke.
*  Yeah, that's right, yes. And the choke gave her multiple strokes. I've never even heard of that
*  before. I will email you exactly what happened to her. Please do.
*  But she got through it and even when she- And went back to training again.
*  She goes back to training, she is. Whoa.
*  I'm picking, on my phone I'll show it to you later.
*  You would think multiple strokes, I'd be like, all right, that's a wrap, we tried that.
*  She just loves it and she now, people are a little, she does one-on-ones, so they don't do
*  that move, whatever that move would be. Again, I'll get all the information and just for your
*  own curiosity, I'll send it to you. But she's back in it, she loves it, and she-
*  She's fully recovered?
*  She's fully recovered.
*  And did it have any effects on-
*  She had a little nerve damage, which honestly, she had a little nerve damage that is now
*  in her foot, so periodically her foot will become completely black and blue.
*  Whoa.
*  I know. But she'll get through it because she's really strong mentally. She wasn't always that
*  way. But we've, my wife and I have sort of helped her with tough love, like you can do it,
*  that kind of a stuff.
*  Sure.
*  Because she's a therapist, she's a psycho, her name is Sage Grazer on the Joe Rogan show.
*  Everyone loves their kids, right?
*  Sure.
*  And so that's what she does. She's an actual therapist with patients and stuff.
*  Oh, I'm glad to hear that she recovered from that. I've never heard of anybody having a stroke from
*  that before. That must be terrifying.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  So back to these conversations that you've had over these 35 years, the ones that you've recorded,
*  what have you done with them? You're holding onto them?
*  I just keep them.
*  People get so mad at me because I tell everybody they should do a podcast. How mad do people get
*  at me? Because I think so many people can. But you definitely should.
*  Well, I should because I like doing this so much. I just, I really,
*  probably like you, I'm just super interested in people.
*  Yes. Curious.
*  I'm really curious.
*  Part of the title of your book.
*  Yeah. So that was, so Curious Mind, I realized that, geez, I've done 35 years of these. At that
*  time, I might've been 30. And my kids, my four kids don't really know what I'm doing. I'm really
*  spending a lot of time hustling to get Edward Teller to meet me. It took a year and a half,
*  two years. Or Darrell Gates, it was the craziest meeting of all time. Darrell Gates, the LA police
*  chief.
*  Wow. How is that the craziest one of all time?
*  Okay, I'll give it to you very quick. I'll give it to you.
*  Okay. So I really thought this guy, he was, you know, he's one of the most well-known and
*  most accomplished police chiefs in America. I think there were three of them and he was one of the three
*  in a century. And then Darrell Gates, I knew created, was one of the creators,
*  the fundamental curator of SWAT, which was bringing paramilitary tactics to the LA police department.
*  He started out as a bright-eyed, strong-minded, clean-cut guy working for the police department.
*  And because he was sharp, he was the driver to the police chief, which was Chief Parker.
*  And then Chief Parker, the LA, there was a riot called the Watts Riot, not the LA riots,
*  but the Watts Riot. And the police went in and they were not qualified to be in that situation.
*  And they kind of failed at it. They felt they failed at it. And Darrell Gates was like by the
*  chief side the entire time. And he kind of vowed to himself, I'm not going to let that happen
*  again. And when he had the opportunity, because he became later police chief, not much later,
*  became police chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, he instituted SWAT and other,
*  paramilitary tactics and a mind discipline that was pretty, was like creating martial law,
*  people would argue. And then we went, that kind of produced an environment that I think many think,
*  and I think myself, helped an environment that caused the LA riots. Because there was a lot of
*  inequity, I think, human inequity felt. I know I'm getting this kind of political. And you should
*  tell me your point of view, please. On the LA riots? Yeah. Well, I moved here after that.
*  Okay. So I wasn't here while that was going down. Right. It was pretty intense. Yeah. And the LA
*  riots were a direct response to the Rodney King trial. Yes, exactly. And yeah, that was a crazy
*  time. I mean, the reaction, first of all, the reaction to the video, the video was horrible,
*  watching Rodney King getting beaten like that. Then you also heard that they had been on the
*  high speed pursuit with him and that there was more to that video. That was the end of their
*  altercation. Apparently there's much more physical altercation before that video. And maybe if someone
*  saw the full thing, they would understand, well, okay, you're dealing with a wild person who's on
*  PCP and these cops are doing everything they can to detain him. But there's a distrust of the police
*  in these communities in the first place because they had seen so much police brutality. So that
*  reaction, that riot was not just because of that one situation. Correct. Yes. It was an accumulation
*  of different events and different interactions that people had had with abusive police officers.
*  It was a boiling pot. Sure. Yeah. And then the whole Rampart unit and there was so much corruption.
*  Yes. There was a lot of shit going down during that time. So all that just,
*  all of it exploded. Exploded. And so the thing about this story is that I was saying about,
*  that I spent, I took, I got a meeting with Darrell Gates. It was 10 months on the book, 10 months.
*  Wow. And ironically, the day of my meeting with him was the day of the LA riots. So I thought,
*  and it already had happened, 2000 buildings on fire and everything. And my office gets a phone
*  call from Darrell Gates' office confirming my meeting with him. I'm thinking, oh my God,
*  Parker Center is under siege. It's like the whole city is under siege. He still wanted to keep the
*  meeting, a meeting that was on the books for 10 months. And I thought, that's really crazy.
*  So I went down, I had a guy drive me and I went down and they zigzagged through like a security
*  clearance thing where no other cars could get through. That was really bizarre. Like we see
*  this now often, but they initiated this kind of maze that the car would go through.
*  I get to the front door, a couple of police chiefs, police officers escort me in, they put me in a
*  room. I joke, they didn't give me a cavity search, but just about everything. But,
*  took my clothes off, did everything.
*  Did they really?
*  Yeah, I did.
*  Why did they think that you,
*  just a scrawny little guy,
*  a guy who makes movies,
*  I don't know.
*  That you would go rogue.
*  No, I know. Like that, there's no evidence of for sure.
*  That's crazy.
*  So, and then I got upstairs and he is sitting so calmly. He'd already ordered two tuna fish
*  sandwiches, very utilitarian, the sandwiches. And we had the potato chips and he said,
*  you want an iced tea? I couldn't even swallow. I couldn't eat my food because I was so shocked
*  by the whole thing that he had so much, he was impervious to everything that was going down.
*  And the city council was on his TV and on the TV out there. And guys, police officers were running
*  and go, chief, you're on TV right now. And they're yelling. And he goes, he says to me and to them,
*  this is nothing. They'll never get me out of here. He had so much hubris. It was amazing.
*  And I thought, and he's so calm about it. And of course they did get him out.
*  I'm trying to think of the next day, actually, because the city council was really,
*  had very liberal guys on that board, people on that board rather.
*  And it's a long, insane story. But I had my meeting, my lunch meeting.
*  Pete Slauson How long was the meeting?
*  Jared Slauson Normal, like an hour, you know, it was a full hour.
*  Pete Slauson So, you just have lunch and just pick his brain and talk to him?
*  Jared Slauson Yeah, just have lunch and ask questions, you know, and try to act,
*  not be nervous or upset about what's going on in the environment and the TV's flashing,
*  you know, like archival footage that they'd shot days before, you know, or the day of,
*  and buildings on fire and the Korean shop market, somebody getting killed and all that stuff they
*  were showing on television. And he was just kind of matter of fact, like this is just what's going
*  down, it's time, it'll just pass. I know, it was crazy.
*  Pete Slauson Well, it sounds like someone designed for the job.
*  Jared Slauson So, I couldn't record that one.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, obviously.
*  Jared Slauson But so, anyway, I did think that my kids should know about all this stuff and actually
*  Charlie Rose of all people said, you should write a book. And so, it got on my mind, I mentioned it
*  to a couple people and they said, oh yeah, you should write a book. And so, then I thought,
*  okay, I'll write a book because I'm going to write notes on this anyway these 35 years from my kids
*  so that when I pass, they'll have this, they'll know this was a very big part of my life, beyond
*  my career, but my life. And so, that's what the first book is about. It synthesizes many of the
*  important one-on-one conversations I had over the 30 years. And then it connects the synthesis
*  of those stories to narrative storytelling. For example, in 1985, 1984, I met Sting, you know,
*  the lead singer of the police. Because I thought, wow, he'd be fascinating to meet because he was
*  like a school teacher in England and now he's like a rock star? I just thought that's kind of an
*  interesting transition, like the biggest, one of the biggest rock stars. So, I meet him, I get him
*  to say yes, it wasn't horribly hard. And then a year after I met with him, he calls up in 1985
*  and he says, I'm having a barbecue at my house, I think some interesting people will be here.
*  And that was right after the Amnesty Tour and he took a woman named Veronica de Negre in 1985,
*  along with other superstars. She wasn't a superstar, she was held in a Chilean prison
*  and tortured every single day of her life for 18 months. And she went on the Amnesty Tour only for
*  a few days as evidence of somebody that can survive, you know, like she was hopeful, you know,
*  still. Like most people don't survive torture either from the torture itself or they, sadly,
*  they commit suicide because they're just so much trauma, so much PTSD. So, it's just, so she survives,
*  I meet her and I say, how do you survive? And she tells me that while she's being,
*  she creates a story that she's living in the entire time. So, there's reality and then there's an
*  alternate reality. The alternate reality is the story that she creates, that she can live in,
*  that alleviates some of the pain and the unpredictable pain of torture. So, now,
*  that's pretty fascinating to me and I really sat with those insights.
*  Now, many things happened after that that I was able to use that, like I became, when I was
*  stuck on a beautiful mind because it wasn't cinematic, I thought, well, how can I make it
*  cinematic? And I thought, Veronica de Negre, she lived in an alternate reality. Well, that's exactly
*  involuntarily what a schizophrenic has to do. They live in alternate realities.
*  So, in the movie A Beautiful Mind, to make it really compelling, we started in an alternate
*  reality and made it a thriller and realized, oh my God, there's this epiphany and you realize
*  that was not even reality, right? And that's what blew people's minds and that's why the movie
*  kind of worked because it drew you in so deeply into this character that it became like this
*  subjective experience that every audience, every audience member could feel like the pain of that
*  and the insanity of what that must feel like. That was another brilliant movie. Oh, thank you.
*  I love that movie. When you say make it cinematic, what do you mean by that exactly?
*  Well, Ron and I realized that Ron Howard, who directed it and won an Oscar,
*  and we realized that in order to make it really interesting, you have to see,
*  you have to understand the mind of a schizophrenic. So, therefore, you have to see somebody's mind.
*  How do you see somebody's mind other than just graphically, you know, or, you know,
*  like through graphic design and, and with that, that's not very interesting, you know,
*  like the insertion of graphic design or voiceover narration, that makes it kind of a documentary.
*  So, but we thought like, but if you could, if you could have an entire story,
*  kind of with the military and paranoia and all that, that's exactly one of the dimensions or
*  realities of a schizophrenic's mind. So, you get to film it with other actors and other people.
*  And that's, that was, that's why I mean when I say cinematic. So, basically, when you're seeing
*  the 25 minutes of living in this alternate reality with Ed Harris and all that stuff, craziness,
*  it blows your mind as an audience and then you reflect later like, wow, that wasn't even real and
*  wow, that guy, is that guy really going to come back? And, you know, you make it seamlessly
*  cinematic with the rest of the narrative, him trying to cope with schizophrenia itself.
*  So, it becomes the merging of an alternate reality and actual reality. And the actual reality is when
*  he's, you watch him in that level of pain and just trying to survive, you know, like cope with meds
*  and the wife and, and then then we, we, we, we found the way to make it, you know, kind of work
*  triumphantly because it was love that was the most powerful force. It was that one person decided to
*  stay with this other one person, the wife, Alicia, stay with John Nash. That's so interesting that
*  you pulled that from that woman's experience of surviving torture. I credit her for that always
*  because she, yeah. So, so that's, so I found that all of these insights, you know, that we're
*  referring to the ones that you have when you're, you know, behind, just getting off stage and you
*  realize, wow, I could talk to my buddies or this new guy for a minute. Those random moments that
*  you get to talk to somebody can often produce a story or an insight, an emotional insight that
*  you can transport to something else, you know, that I found that all these conversations that I was
*  having were like, kind of like I see these stars behind you. They were like stars or a constellation
*  of dots, you know, and that you just have faith that they somehow inform you and make you better
*  and smarter and that they connect someday. Well, it's so insightful that you look at these
*  conversations that way because, I mean, I really have felt that effect on me personally over the
*  years doing this, but the fact that you've like sought it out just as an education, just as
*  something that expands you because we really are a combination or an accumulation of all of our
*  experiences and the more experiences you can have, even if it doesn't feel tangible in that moment,
*  it broadens your perspective. It broadens who you are. Well, I think for you as well, because you
*  still do stand up. We were talking about that some of them works in my office, saw you the other
*  night and you remembered who she was. She goes, he won't remember me. And you did. She used to be
*  on Kill Tony. Kill Tony is a great podcast that my friend Brian Redban and Tony Hinchcliffe do.
*  And this podcast involves comedians going up and doing one minute of material in front of these
*  professional comics. And the professional comics either say, hey, that was great, or they shit all
*  over it or everybody makes fun. There's a band, there's a bunch of chaos and it's all done in
*  front of a live crowd. And Vanessa was on it for quite a while. Wow. Oh, that's good. Yeah.
*  She tries hard. I know that. I mean, she works hard. Yeah. But as I was saying, like, when I
*  watch you do stand up, because I made a point to catch up on it, you're really, really good.
*  And you're telling, I'm watching you tell stories that are comedic story. You make them comedic.
*  And I could, I think I can tell, and you tell me if I'm wrong, that sometimes you don't know
*  all the answers to that story. And I see that you're grabbing things that lived in, that you
*  experiences or insights that lived in the environment that you have or had. Because I
*  watched a couple of scenes very closely and I know you didn't have it figured out and you got the
*  bigger laugh from the thing that you pulled from someplace, I thought. Or you're just a really good
*  actor. There's a little bit of recreating that when you're doing that in stand up, but oftentimes
*  it's a combination of all those things. It's a combination of actually improvising in the moment
*  and figuring it out in the moment and then figuring out in the moment and recreating it again.
*  And recreating it again the same way you did before. But being in the moment and being able
*  to bring it into someone's attention as if you're recreating it or give them the feeling that it's
*  being recreated so that they can experience it. So that's what stand up is. There's revelations
*  that you repeat. And then I'm like, wait, what the fuck is that about? But you have to be able
*  to recreate that over and over and over again. Like a beginner's mind. It's brand new for you.
*  You're thinking for the people in the sense that, say if you go to see a great comic like
*  Bill Burr and you're sitting in the audience and Bill's on stage, you're allowing him to think for
*  you in a way. He's taking you on a journey. So it has to be- He's pointing left and right and
*  now we're going straight. And you're just going along with it like this is the ride. I'm letting
*  him take over the reins of my attention and my mind. Yeah. So there's a craft to that. Yeah,
*  you're the passenger. He's the driver in the Formula One car. Yes. And so any great comic,
*  whether it's Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle or figure whoever it is, when they're on stage and
*  they're killing, you are allowing them to think for you. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. So I love
*  it. So they're trying to take you on an organic journey of understanding whatever the fuck they're
*  talking about and explaining it to you in a way that's going to resonate. This is how you would
*  notice it. You're allowing them to think. This is how you- And I'm like, hold up. Who the fuck brought the baby?
*  Yeah. And then that kind of stuff is like in that moment, it has to feel like you're really
*  realizing that somebody brought a fucking baby to a gun range or whatever it is, whatever you're
*  joking around about. That's funny. Right. That's interesting. Yeah. So it is these conversations
*  are really kind of valuable on so many levels. Yeah. They're not like- Sometimes people will go,
*  uh, people sometimes just want to get to the end, like how do I make the money? But the journey is
*  really valuable. Sure. Yeah. There's a lot of people that get into podcasts specifically because
*  of that. They think there's money in podcasts. Like how do you make money in podcasts? Yeah.
*  I've had that conversation. I'm like, well, make a good podcast that people like. Yeah. But then-
*  It's kind of simple. Yeah. And the best way to do that is to actually enjoy doing podcasts.
*  Right. That's really the best way. Yeah. And then people are like,
*  that sounds like a lot of work. It does. You also have to do it over a long enough period of time
*  where people, you know, like one person tells another person tells- One thing that I've never
*  done with this podcast, I've never advertised it in the sense that I never did anything to make it
*  grow. I just did it. I just kept doing it. I never did anything like I never took out ads. I never
*  went on shows to promote it. I never did anything to promote it. I just did it. And I did that on
*  purpose because I wanted to never have any thought at all about growing it. I only wanted
*  to think about doing the best that I can. Right. And then it just became what it is. Not make it
*  a commercial experience. Yes. I mean, it became that. It became that. But even while it's become
*  that, I haven't changed. I've changed how I do it because I got better at it and because I became
*  a different person as I've gone through my own personal evolution. But I don't change my thought
*  on it, which is just do it. Just enjoy it and do it and do the best I can and try,
*  whoever I'm talking to, try to connect with them. And some people like you,
*  I'm connecting with really easily. It's fun. It's great. I enjoy this conversation. It's great.
*  It's easy. But then some people, it's like a little bit of pulling teeth. Some people,
*  it's harder. You're doing heavy lifting. Yes, for sure. But it's still enjoyable. All of it.
*  It's still like when it's heavy lifting, it's like, oh, okay, how do I solve this problem?
*  Yeah. I totally know what you're talking about. I had this female rapper at my house.
*  Like really a big, and I'm good at creating conversation. It was almost impossible.
*  It was like, I was freaking out. Oh my God. I'd like to hear that one.
*  Yeah, yeah. And then finally... How long did it last? Oh, finally you hit something?
*  No, finally I hit two things, something. Finally...
*  Two things. One thing was she liked to talk about
*  this is going to reveal who it is. And I ended up liking her so much. She liked to talk about
*  stripping and prostitution and pimps. Oh, okay. I know what that is.
*  And she's got a master's class on this. Oh, sure.
*  Like she's a genius. Okay. So that she could do, but it took a long time to get there.
*  Really a lot of... Very polite to me, but kind of looking around a lot.
*  And then... Uncomfortable with you.
*  Well, she's just not knowing... We weren't relating to each other.
*  She's very street. And then when she hit it, yes.
*  I thought it was really funny and how she diagnosed the street, that thing.
*  Wow, she's like a scientist in this area. Oh yeah. Well, a lot of hustlers are. A lot
*  of people that are hustling. So she was really good. And then she and her
*  husband decided they're really interested in some art that I had on the wall. And that produced more
*  interest in more art. And then they wanted to know, why is this worth so much money?
*  Well, how does pricing work? I said, well, dealers. You go, what do you mean by dealers?
*  I go, what's a dealer? So I explained what dealers were, like Larry Gagosian kind of sets the market.
*  What does that mean? And then they were very interested in that.
*  Wow. So then it got to be kind of longer and then I had to go someplace.
*  But it worked out. But it worked out really well.
*  And so to your point, it was really, really hard to figure out this puzzle. And then we
*  accidentally upon a way to crack that puzzle. And that was really gratifying. And it was good
*  enough that I'm talking about it on your show. So it was memorable for sure.
*  So it elevated your people skills.
*  You added another facet to your game.
*  I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
*  And you learned about pimps and hoes.
*  And pricing. I learned pricing in that field.
*  In that field.
*  It is a field. It's just a suppressed field.
*  Yeah. She was really mad about the idea of a pimp. Like, why would anyone give a pimp money?
*  I understand that.
*  I don't get it. Yeah. Okay. So.
*  Yeah. I guess protection, right?
*  Yeah. I guess. She wasn't acknowledging that as protection.
*  Maybe she doesn't need it.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So there's that. And so the other book I wrote, because this kind of ties in,
*  it's kind of interesting. Because you asked, actually. So what happened is, in my house,
*  there was a new person that started working on our staff at home kind of thing. And
*  working on the house staff kind of thing. I'm not like butlers. I'm not going to...
*  What do you mean by house staff?
*  Just like we have people that are house keepers, that either cook or they clean or they...
*  But it's a team. I have a team.
*  Okay.
*  But I don't want to mislead you and make you think like I'm living in... It's not insane.
*  This is what I'm picturing. I'm picturing a dude with a napkin over his forearm.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Mr. Gray's...
*  That's what I don't know. Please don't. Yeah, it's not that. I'm glad that you pointed that out.
*  And that he gives you your top hat.
*  No, no, no. Yeah, yeah, top hat. And gets my tux ready every night.
*  You get into the Rolls Royce and they throw rose petals at your feet.
*  Yeah, yeah. Thurston Howell. No.
*  Hello.
*  Yeah, no, it's not that. It's just like an organized place.
*  I get it. You're balling. It's all good.
*  Something. And so apparently she'd work there.
*  That's funny. So apparently she worked at our house for like almost three months. And my wife,
*  she says to my wife, I really like Brian a lot. And my wife said, well, have you talked to him
*  much? She said, well, I haven't talked to him very much, but every time he speaks to me,
*  he always looks me directly in my eyes and it makes me feel like a human being.
*  And I thought of the simplicity of that. I thought, wow, just by looking at somebody
*  directly in the eyes, real not looking behind them or you're just looking at them,
*  it immediately is an equalizer. It says we're both equal. We're both species on this plant,
*  the same species on this. And it makes me feel like a human being, gives me dignity.
*  Mm-hmm. And then I thought, that's pretty powerful. I mean, this is only like two years ago.
*  And then I retrofitted back all of those conversations I was alluding to, like 35
*  years of every week, a curiosity conversation. And I thought, well, the only reason these
*  conversations were good is I must have been really looking at these people in the eyes and we were
*  really dialed in. Otherwise, they wouldn't share these private things or these insights. They
*  wouldn't share their heart with me if they didn't feel I was present with them. And so that became
*  kind of the thesis of this book. And that's why it's just called Face to Face, The Art of Human
*  Connection. Because then I set all of this, I thought to myself, we're living right now in the
*  loneliest decade, the loneliest time in our generation. It's like an epidemic of loneliness.
*  Is it?
*  It is, actually. All statistics point millennials will admit that one quarter of them will admit
*  that they're incredibly lonely, like where they can't almost cope with their loneliness.
*  Do you think that's digital lives?
*  I think it's digital lives for sure, because they're not even used to talking now, because
*  everything is a text. And you know with kids, and I have a 16-year-old kid who just turned 16,
*  they text each other when they're in the same room. They're sitting there watching Netflix,
*  and they're texting each other like, who are you texting? Johnny, Johnny's right there.
*  He's right on the couch, just talk to him, he's right there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's weird.
*  It's weird. And this dating, that's why these kids, they just ghost girls or ghost guys,
*  just vaporize, because they don't have feelings. When you don't talk to people,
*  because you're really out there, you're feeling people all the time. When you feel people,
*  you have empathy, you feel their feelings, right?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  And when you feel people's feelings, you try not to hurt their feelings.
*  Right, yeah. Yeah, when you're actually in the presence of them, instead of digitally.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you feel people's feelings, and you meet them and demystify whatever you think you heard
*  about them, you tend to like them more for the most part, and you tend to love as opposed to
*  have war. So it really is important in our lives from multiple levels, like just looking at people
*  and going out of your way to connect.
*  Yeah, no, I agree.
*  So that's what this book's about, basically.
*  And doing that reaffirms it in yourself.
*  Exactly. It reaffirms it in myself, because it's like a tool, you're right, exactly. You get it.
*  Beyond get it. But it's like, I learn off of it every day because I'm not perfect,
*  but I make sure that when I get into elevators, I practice what I preach. I put my phone away,
*  I don't go in the elevator and just look at my phone. I look at people, I'm just cool,
*  I can relax, you know, chill. And then often you make people feel better if you're actually
*  looking at them.
*  For sure, yeah, for sure.
*  I've, the last week, I put a one hour limit on my phone use.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, I put a one hour limit on whether it's apps per day.
*  Per day, you mean?
*  Yeah, apps, whatever I'm using. And I've thought about looking at the phone aimlessly.
*  I've got this thing now that I'm doing where I just grab my phone and I go, no, no, no.
*  And then I put it away. Because people are really, really addicted to phones.
*  They're really addicted.
*  And you don't realize until you look at that screen time, that reading that you get at the
*  end of the day, you're like, five hours?
*  I'm sure I'm in that, maybe four.
*  A lot of us are.
*  Yeah.
*  But that digital connection, the connection to, you're missing, you're missing this connection
*  to other people. And also, there's a certain amount of anxiety attached to it, where people
*  are constantly checking their social media and checking their emails and their mentions
*  and going back and forth with this and that and looking at this and that. And it's like,
*  you're not in the real world. You're only living on this little tiny device,
*  this little rectangular device. And it's weird.
*  Yeah. And it contributes to loneliness and disconnection and-
*  Unhappiness.
*  Unhappiness.
*  Yeah. And I don't know what the solution is other than abstinence.
*  Yeah.
*  Other than putting them away.
*  Well, at some point, I think we're going, I have this feeling that the privileged people,
*  I don't want to say it that way, I think it could be the most scarce and valued commodity
*  is being present with human beings.
*  Yes.
*  And it's like, the cool kids, they're listening to vinyls, right?
*  Mm-hmm. Well, I think the people that are
*  good at it are rare. The people that, like what you've done, you've practiced this idea of sitting
*  down and talking to people on a regular basis, looking them in the eye and having meaningful
*  conversations. You've made a choice. You've made a concerted effort to do that. And that's not
*  common. And most people don't have good people skills. I mean, I've learned how to not interrupt
*  people. I've learned how to not talk so much. I've learned how to listen. I've learned how to
*  interact. And I've also learned when people are not good at it. Some people, you're talking to
*  them and they're not even listening to you. They're just waiting for their turn to talk.
*  Yes. I have a couple of guys I know that do that.
*  It's frustrating.
*  It is frustrating. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, because you kind of go, what's the whole, what's the point of this?
*  Yeah. We're not connected.
*  We're not connected.
*  Like we both like.
*  I'm sure you've met people that will ask you three questions basically at the same time,
*  like bam, bam, bam. And you're trying to answer the first question. Then you realize now we're
*  sharp enough to know that they don't really want to know the answer.
*  Yeah. They might be just on Adderall. Just firing questions at you. What about this? The sky's blue.
*  How do I know it's blue for you? What is blue?
*  I just had lunch with one of my funniest close friends. His name is Jimmy Iveen. And he's a
*  music producer. And he and Dre created this Beats. And we've known each other like,
*  I guess 30 years. We were at this restaurant called, I won't even say it's a Greek restaurant,
*  Beverly Hills. And our waiter, Jimmy goes, that dude's on Adderall. Because he was like,
*  I mean, like he just, I said it's too much Tony Robbins for me. He said, no, it's Adderall.
*  Yeah.
*  But he was just like, you couldn't finish a sentence.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Or we said, okay, we think we know what we want. We're going to have the branzino.
*  He rattled off like 10 dishes. We go, we realized we couldn't stop him. We knew what we, we said
*  what we wanted. He didn't want to hear it. He wanted to do the other nine.
*  Yeah.
*  So, yeah.
*  That's a common thing today. Incredibly common. There's a lot of people on speed.
*  A lot. And the doctors are just prescribing it.
*  Really? Actually on speed.
*  That's what Adderall is.
*  Yeah. So you think people are really, that's the thing I don't know that much about that.
*  Legal speed. Adderall's legal speed prescribed by a doctor. If you went to a doctor right now,
*  you went to the right doctor.
*  Yes.
*  And said, I just feel listless. I'm having a hard time connecting. I'm having a hard time getting
*  motivated. Oh, I got the thing for you, Brian.
*  Wow.
*  Here you go. And then you'd be like, I am organized. And you know what? It's about me.
*  It's about me. Because Brian's out here fucking kicking ass. There's a lot of other people that
*  are slacking. They're all losers. This guy's a loser. That guy's a loser. That is-
*  That's really hilarious.
*  That is not the Adderall mindset.
*  That is the Adderall mindset.
*  Adderall mindset, it's basically a low level meth mindset. It's speed. It's amphetamines.
*  It's super jacked up. Like not listening, just talking.
*  It's almost like a saltive, isn't it?
*  Yeah. Well, you can get productive. You can get a lot done with that. But it's just,
*  there's a lack of connection.
*  Yeah, there is.
*  Lack of severe, lack of empathy.
*  Sorry. It's not really real.
*  No.
*  It's like-
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's a weird sort of vibe that-
*  I'm going to look for it and I'm going to prospect for it.
*  Oh, there's a lot out there. You'll find it. It's mining for gold.
*  It's like, I didn't realize there's gold in Denver Hills.
*  That's funny.
*  You go prospecting for people that have Adderall.
*  That are in Adderall.
*  You better have a large cargo to put it in. You got a large train box.
*  I got to check it out.
*  It's a lot.
*  Because I thought it was funny when he said it and I thought,
*  and he goes, no, no, this is really true. Like what you would say to me right now.
*  He goes, no, no, this guy, he's actually on it. And I go, really? And he says, yeah.
*  How does a guy become that guy? He literally was on the table.
*  A lot of writers, a lot of journalists, a lot of journalists, a lot of people that have to
*  deadlines and they have to push and they run out of energy. A lot of them are on Adderall.
*  Extremely, extremely common.
*  Extremely common with very productive people, very ambitious people, business people, people
*  that do a lot of meetings, people that work 12 hours a day, 13 hours a day.
*  It gives you the energy to do that. And then they take Ambien to crash.
*  And there's a double whammy going on.
*  We know that's not good.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Yeah. It's, there's millions and millions of people that are on that stuff.
*  Do they ever, if you ever ask somebody on the show, like,
*  oh, you probably wouldn't. Well, I don't know. Does anyone ever tell you they're on it?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, really?
*  People tell me. Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like at comedy clubs or on the show?
*  No, I've had people tell me on the show that they take Adderall.
*  I've had people in real life tell me they've taken Adderall. I mean, I've had people justify it.
*  I've had people talk about it with a little bit of shame that they would like to not be on it,
*  but they're on it because it helps them be productive and they got to do what they got to do.
*  Yeah. But the real revelation was I have a friend who's a journalist and he was talking to me about
*  how many journalists are on it. He's not on it. I go, well, how many? He goes, fucking all of them.
*  And I'm like, are you serious? He goes, dude, it would blow your mind.
*  It would blow your mind how many of them.
*  Wow.
*  Because it's so effective.
*  See, we wouldn't...
*  I wouldn't really know.
*  No, I've never messed with it. But if you do... Jamie, you've tried it, right?
*  Yeah.
*  How was it?
*  Did not like it. I had to call off the next day of work because I thought I could go to sleep.
*  I only took a little bit just to do some artwork because I knew I was going to have to...
*  You have an unusual constitution. Jamie, edible marijuana does not affect him.
*  Literally, he could take a thousand milligrams to play video games.
*  Geez.
*  Or more.
*  Or more.
*  A thousand milligrams put most people under the couch for life. They'd be like, no,
*  miting. Jamie can handle it.
*  I cannot do that. I can't do it. There was a minute I was single and a girl said to me,
*  let's have one of these lollipops. She pulled them out of her refrigerator.
*  I took a little lick of a lollipop. She, whatever. And it was interesting. It wasn't terrible.
*  In the next weekend, I see the girl again. I'm at my house and she... I hope I'm not going to...
*  Let me see if I can... Okay, I'm okay here.
*  But she says, I got more lollipops than I thought. Well, that was kind of fun.
*  I take this... I lick on this lollipop. Oh my God, it so freaked me out. I called my doctor,
*  Dr. Dennis Evangelatos. That's his name. I'm saying that's okay. He's good. And he... I said,
*  I need you to come over right now and sleep over. He goes... He slept... He did. He slept
*  in my bedroom at the foot of my bed.
*  That's a good doctor.
*  He was so good. I said... He's right in Westwood and I was in Malibu and I said,
*  I said, I'm serious. He goes, look, this is what will happen. I can tell you exactly what happens.
*  It goes up and it's going to come down. Everything... I go, I don't think I can
*  survive it. I am too scared. So he said he'll sleep over and he slept over the whole night.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's the problem with those...
*  He was a good doctor.
*  Those lollipops and candies and stuff like that, they're not consistent.
*  You've never done it, have you?
*  What?
*  Oh, I don't know.
*  All the time, man. Yeah. Constantly.
*  I don't think so.
*  Yes. Honestly.
*  You did... Really?
*  Yeah. I smoke a lot of pot. I eat a lot of pot.
*  Swear?
*  Oh yeah. I got a box of it right here.
*  But you seem so physical.
*  Surrounded by it.
*  Can you...
*  Yeah, you're surrounded by it.
*  Oh, so you can actually...
*  This is all... This is weed.
*  That's not weed.
*  You want to smoke it and see if you go to Pluto?
*  Yeah, I don't want to...
*  That's Mike Tyson's weed.
*  I don't believe you...
*  That fat one right there, that's weed.
*  Wait a second.
*  That's weed right there.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay. You guys tell me the truth. Let me see that.
*  Oh, you got some mushrooms?
*  Well, that looks real.
*  Our big box just got taken away. It's getting filled right now. We could open that for you.
*  Wow. This is...
*  That's real.
*  Jeez.
*  Eat one of these. That'll put you on the moon.
*  It's not like... I can't do anything. I'll need my doctor.
*  That's really... Wow.
*  I like the smell of pot and stuff.
*  Yeah, it smells good.
*  But I know it's not good for me. It's not my thing.
*  Margarita tonight. Maybe tonight, actually.
*  A margarita?
*  Yeah, I like margarita.
*  I do too.
*  You got all your stuff here.
*  Be careful with those.
*  All your snacks. No, I'm not going to touch it.
*  Okay. This is a real issue.
*  Can you do it during the day?
*  Oh, if you want to die.
*  Some spray.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  I mean, can you do it during the day and be functional, highly functional?
*  Yes, I can. Yes.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow, I really admire you.
*  Well, it works with more than ever.
*  It works with my...
*  Because you're so high functioning.
*  Yeah, but it just makes me more sensitive. That's what marijuana does to me. But the paranoia,
*  I kind of just embrace it. The paranoia that comes with being really, really high.
*  Wow.
*  I just meditate, calm down, embrace it.
*  And enjoy it.
*  Yeah. Yeah, a lot of the freaking out comes from freaking out.
*  Yes, that's with me.
*  You're freaking out and you're like, oh my God, I'm freaking out.
*  Yes, I'm watching myself. I'm going, oh, I'm out of control. I think I'll freak out.
*  And then that's what happens.
*  It sounds crazy, but it makes me a nicer person.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, it makes me nicer. I want to be better. I want to be a better person.
*  It highlights all the flaws that I find in my own personality and my own life,
*  all whatever things I've done that I'm not proud of or that I think are mistakes. It highlights them
*  and it makes me think more diligently.
*  Softening a little bit.
*  Be a better person.
*  Geez, that's good.
*  Enhances my sense of community. Makes me more sensitive, makes food taste better.
*  Getting a contactor tie right now.
*  Well, this is sober October for me, so I'm not doing anything.
*  Can you do that? I guess you can.
*  Yeah, yeah. I don't have an addiction, but me and my buddies...
*  It's choice. You dig it. It's fun. And you and your buddies are cool with it.
*  Yeah, we do sober October, so the entire month of October every year. We do something.
*  Last year we did a fitness challenge.
*  What's that thing? It's like Ramadan.
*  Yeah, it's like Ramadan for us. The year before that we did hot yoga. We had to do 15 hot yoga
*  sessions over the month. Yeah, this year we have to do 10 classes of any kind and we have to read
*  500 pages of any book. Yeah, so we do it...
*  You like to test yourselves.
*  Yeah, and it's fun.
*  In a cool way.
*  Join along and this year we're all wearing these whoop straps.
*  What is a whoop strap?
*  A whoop strap is a fitness monitor that works with this application that works on your phone
*  that monitors heart rate variability. So it tells you, first of all, it tells you how much you're
*  sleeping, which is very revealing. It tells you what kind of sleep you're getting and it gives
*  you like very detailed analytics. It shows it.
*  How much do you sleep? Can we just stay on that one? Because I have a good sleep apnea,
*  so I know because I go to an app. I have an app.
*  Okay. So do you use a CPAP machine?
*  I do.
*  Yeah.
*  I do.
*  Two guys in a row use a CPAP. My friend Chris Ryan, who's here right before you,
*  uses a CPAP machine.
*  This is my thing. Look at this.
*  Yeah, I have sleep apnea as well.
*  Look, I got 87 last night.
*  Uh-huh.
*  I had a bad night's...
*  What is 87?
*  That's the score. That's the computation. It's like a coefficient. How many... Okay.
*  I wear glasses, but you can see it right there.
*  It says 87, but what does that mean? How many hours? Okay, five hours and 52.
*  I think 37. Was it 552?
*  Yes. usage hours. It says five hours and 52. It says good.
*  Good. Yeah.
*  Uh, okay.
*  On the seal.
*  Yeah, good. Make a seal. It says you had six events per hour.
*  Event. Six events per hour?
*  Yeah, that's what it says.
*  Wow, that's not good. Well, it's probably right. I had a bad... I didn't sleep well last night.
*  Actually, it says 0.6. Is that the same thing as six?
*  No.
*  What does that mean? Oh, so you didn't have six an hour.
*  Yeah, six an hour is a lot.
*  Well, it's weird because it says 0.6 and then it says five in the corner. What does that mean?
*  Five total over the six hours of sleep.
*  Five total? Oh, look. What are you, you wizard?
*  Well, he's thinking... He measures pot. He can do... He's like a pound of pot, not a problem.
*  It says mask on and off four. So you took your mask off four times?
*  To pee and then...
*  Oh, okay.
*  To pee twice and then twice because I was obsessing over something.
*  Oh, thinking.
*  I had to break the obsession.
*  Oh, I understand. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Okay. I wear a mouthpiece.
*  Dude, ooh, those are hot.
*  Presses down on my tongue.
*  Yes.
*  Keeps my tongue from falling back over the hole in my mouth.
*  Oh, so it's not about your teeth. It's about falling back.
*  Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  What does that thing... What's that called?
*  Once that would happen.
*  Who doesn't matter what it's called, but you have it.
*  Dr. Kvorkean. Is that his name? Koro-pean.
*  No, I think...
*  Kvorkean's the murderer guy.
*  Yeah, he's the murderer.
*  Koro-pean. Dr. Koro-pean.
*  Obviously.
*  Whoops. It was a mistake.
*  But yeah, it just keeps your tongue from falling back.
*  I have a fat tongue. That's my problem.
*  Fat.
*  Fat. It closes the air hole.
*  Geez.
*  Yeah, so it keeps it from doing that.
*  A lot to be said about that.
*  Yeah, I guess.
*  So what the WhoopStrap does is it monitors all of your sleep,
*  but it also measures heart rate variability so it tells you whether you're tired or not.
*  So if you've had a hard workout and then you're still a little beat down the next day,
*  it'll show you on the application.
*  Like, here's your heart rate.
*  Your heart rate is responding to the fact that you had an extremely stressful,
*  physically stressful day.
*  So good stresses and bad stresses, exercise and lack of sleep,
*  all those things are monitored and it gives you pretty detailed analytics.
*  So we're all wearing these straps and we're doing these 10 different classes.
*  Like we've done tactical gun classes and yoga classes and boxing classes.
*  And the whole idea about the month is sort of just helping yourself,
*  like doing things that are good for you.
*  Self-help.
*  Great. Got it. I see.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, self-help.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the month of getting smarter, better.
*  Yeah, learning some new shit, meditating, getting an education, reading 500 pages of some books.
*  Who are the guys?
*  You have to say their...
*  Tom Segura, who's a stand-up comedian, Burt Kreischer, another comedian,
*  and Ari Shafir and myself.
*  And we've done this for the last...
*  Well, the first year, Tom and Burt had a weight loss challenge.
*  And then the second year, we said, okay, we'll all jump in and we'll all be sober this time
*  because they weren't sober the first time.
*  They just lost weight and we'll all be sober and we'll all have to fulfill
*  these number of hot yoga classes.
*  So 15, 90 minute hot yoga classes.
*  And then the next year we had...
*  15, 90 minutes.
*  Yes.
*  Ooh, wow.
*  And then the next year we had a crazy fitness challenge.
*  That got a little out of hand.
*  So we decided not to compete with each other anymore because we were
*  literally going five, six, seven hours a day of working out.
*  Yeah, seven hours a day of cardio.
*  It was bananas.
*  It was nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It was getting high on exercise.
*  And so then this year...
*  I'm not in your group.
*  I know why now.
*  This year was just the fitness classes, different classes, 10 classes,
*  and then 500 pages of any book, just reading something.
*  Pretty great.
*  Yeah, it's fun.
*  Yeah.
*  It gives me something to do.
*  We look forward to it.
*  And then a lot of fans do it along with us.
*  So a lot of people go sober through the month and join in with us.
*  And you know...
*  Fans from the show say, hey, I want to be part of this.
*  Yeah, they just jump in.
*  I mean, you can wear a whoop strap too.
*  You can compare the amount of sleep and the amount of exercise that you get to us.
*  But more importantly, for people, it's nice for people that maybe don't even know that
*  they have a little bit of an issue with substances.
*  Maybe they're not alcoholics or drug addicts, but maybe they just are indulging a little too much.
*  And so they'll get this break for October because they're committed for the entire month.
*  And then what they see is like, you know what?
*  I feel a lot better.
*  And I don't have a problem, but I do feel a lot better when I'm not drinking all the time.
*  Because I'm going to comedy clubs and I'll have a couple beers.
*  Hey, you want to do a shot?
*  All right, let's do a shot.
*  And then the next day I'm like, oh, then I go to the gym and it's like a little bit more of a struggle.
*  But this entire month, what is it today?
*  23rd?
*  This, there's none of that.
*  This entire month is just, you feel good.
*  You're on.
*  Yeah.
*  And you realize that is an unnecessary tax on your system, alcohol in particular.
*  Pot doesn't make me feel like shit the next day, but it definitely does some wonky things to your
*  memory.
*  Pot does?
*  For sure.
*  Oh yeah.
*  For sure.
*  We all have pot memory.
*  All of us.
*  Pot memory.
*  Yeah, pot memory is weird.
*  Yeah, it's just like definitely does something to your memory.
*  I mean, that's pretty much proven.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, so that's what we do all the month.
*  That's interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  So do these go, oh, and you guys can afford to do that because you can still work.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Still do stand up.
*  Still do the podcast, still do everything.
*  Yeah.
*  And then we have no remember November where we get blitzed.
*  That is hilarious.
*  So you have to look forward to, right?
*  Not really.
*  I mean, I didn't really, I definitely went.
*  You don't mean blitz, you just go for it.
*  Yeah, it went hard a couple of days in November last year.
*  Nothing.
*  Super funny.
*  And your buddies are funny guys.
*  Yeah, it's fun.
*  You keep each other.
*  Well, it's a camaraderie thing too.
*  Yeah.
*  The four of us, it's a lot of bonding and it's very fun.
*  Like the podcasts we have are very fun.
*  And the one that we did when Sober October was over last year was ridiculous.
*  We were barbecued.
*  It was very fun.
*  Yeah, but it is a good thing for people just to have that monthly,
*  that one month reset of their system.
*  Yeah.
*  Just to give them a perspective like, hey, maybe it'd be better if you didn't drink.
*  Maybe it'd be better if you took some time off.
*  Maybe better if you exercised and really thought about things this way.
*  I mean, we're only doing it once a month, but we even proposed doing it a couple of times a year.
*  And it proves to you, I guess, obviously, it does prove to you, you can do it.
*  Yes.
*  And that's an important thing.
*  It's like having an exit, right?
*  Yeah.
*  When you're trapped on a boat or you're in some place with people, you have an exit here.
*  You know you can do it.
*  Well, the motivation for a lot of it was our friend Bert who drinks way too much.
*  And he's calmed down quite a bit, apparently, because of doing that first podcast where we
*  did go sober for the whole month, because we didn't think he could do it.
*  Because even during the weight loss challenge, Tom, who won the weight loss challenge,
*  Tom didn't drink anything but water the entire month and worked out like crazy and lost a ton
*  of weight. Bert kept drinking the entire month and also worked out like crazy and tried to lose weight.
*  And what happened?
*  He lost.
*  He couldn't compete with Tom.
*  It doesn't work.
*  Yeah. It was just a dumb way of doing it. It wasn't as effective.
*  Right. Of course.
*  Now there's this new, I guess, nutritional exercise or weight loss, I don't want to
*  only call it that, of like, what is it, 16 hours, I don't know, is it 10 hours on, 10 hours off?
*  Oh, intermittent fasting?
*  Intermittent fasting, yes.
*  Basically missing breakfast.
*  See, I can't lose weight. I mean, I'm a happy, I don't need to lose weight, actually. But I can
*  get stronger and have better disciplines and areas. But that particular thing is about losing weight,
*  I think, right?
*  Mostly. It's about losing weight, but it's also about feeling better and raising your
*  ketone levels, which is one thing that does happen when you go long periods of time and you get your
*  body accustomed to this period of time where you're not eating, this timed eating or whatever
*  they call it. What is the term they refer to it as? It's not just intermittent fasting. There's
*  time restricted eating?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  There's some benefit on your digestive system as well. So your body's not eating 10 hours a day,
*  15 hours a day, or even more with some people. Some people are just eating constantly throughout
*  the day. Instead of this, you have a four hour window or a six hour window or an eight hour
*  window, whatever you decide it is. And during that time you can eat, but after that it's over.
*  And then you cannot eat for X amount of hours, whether it's 10 or 12 or 14. Yeah. You get
*  accustomed to it though.
*  Yeah. See, my goal, because I don't know if I could, I'm sure you could prove me wrong,
*  I'm not sure I could do any of those really strict disciplines of any type almost. So I've always
*  thought if I do everything with moderation, I might not have to do one of these things that
*  I might find to be too hard.
*  Strict. It's not hard. It's not hard.
*  It's not?
*  No.
*  Seems hard.
*  It does seem hard.
*  It seems really hard.
*  Yeah. You get used to it though. You honestly get used to it. And then once you do get used to it,
*  then it becomes normal.
*  Okay.
*  So once you get like a couple, three days, four days or a week or something, I don't know.
*  Yeah. Once you get a few days in, it's no big deal. Yeah. You get used to it.
*  Is that a way of saying that if I really committed to it, it's possible I could do it?
*  Of course you could do it. Look, you're an accomplished man. You can do anything you want.
*  You just have to force yourself to do it. Just decide.
*  I need a compelling reason to do it.
*  Sure. Well, that's one of the beautiful things.
*  Like if a doctor said-
*  Right. Get that doctor that sleeps over your house.
*  Get him to write a prescription. But like the thing that we talked about, like sober October,
*  one of the things about it is that we all know that this is coming. October 1st, boom, it's here.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're committed for the month. It's not like a wishy washy idea.
*  Are you nervous about it?
*  No.
*  Is there any anticipatory stress?
*  Yeah. You think about it. No, not really, but you think about it.
*  You think about it.
*  We've done it a couple of years in a row now, three years in a row. But the thing about it is that it's
*  there. It's a real thing. It starts. And then you can't be wishy washy. Like part of the thing
*  that people have a problem with diets and with exercise routines is that they're wishy washy.
*  They give themselves a way out. If you know that you have to work out one hour, six days a week,
*  every day you have to work out one hour. You get one day a week off. You have to. No cheating.
*  And you write it down on a schedule and you decide all the month of November,
*  I'm going to work out one hour a day, six days a week, period. And then I'm going to write it down.
*  I'm going to mark my calendar with an X every time I accomplish that. Well, if you just do that,
*  you're going to get it done. But if you say, um, I need to work out more. Well,
*  that's not a very specific goal.
*  A little flexible. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't work.
*  Specific.
*  Yeah. You have to go. There's no, this is, this is, this is absolute.
*  These boundaries are inflexible.
*  You have to hold yourself accountable.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah. You have to make sure that you're accountable.
*  All right. When I pick something up like that, I'm going to let you know.
*  What would you want to do? Like if you wanted to do something, if you had a thing and you say,
*  Hmm, what would I want to do? Uh,
*  maybe not drinking for a month. I've never done that.
*  How about no booze November?
*  Well, that's coming up. Maybe for next year. You mean?
*  I need to warm up.
*  I gotta warm up.
*  How much time do you need to prepare?
*  A year sounds good.
*  Okay. Sober October. Why don't you do sober October with us next year?
*  Wow.
*  How about that? That gives you a whole year.
*  It's in my mind. I got it.
*  Hmm, not sure. Sounds a little wishy-washy.
*  Well, I'm going to try to, I'm going to try to think about doing it.
*  Yeah. You don't have to do it.
*  Yeah. But I can, I can try to warm up and think it's possible.
*  You certainly could do it.
*  Yeah. I probably could do it. I mean, I took a week off and then it was very,
*  I could have gone, I could have gone.
*  No, I could have gone a little, well, yes, a little bit.
*  It was a little bit. But I thought after the week, I thought I could keep going.
*  But then I thought, I don't know, it's kind of nice luxury to have a margarita or a glass of wine.
*  It is a nice luxury.
*  So I thought, I don't know, no one's making me not, I'll just go back to drinking.
*  Right. Yeah, that's the thing.
*  I mean, I have no reason, you know, but if I had reasons and I'd,
*  like I didn't want to wear that sleep apnea machine and I put it off for, oh God, five, six years.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. And then by the way, the sleep apnea machines got smaller and smaller and smaller
*  and less intrusive. So now they're very easy.
*  Yeah.
*  But it still was somewhat intrusive. And now I, it's, I always sleep with it.
*  I never thought I would do that because I thought, you know, I'm laying with my wife,
*  I like to feel like a more romantic guy or something or could be.
*  You sound like Darth Vader.
*  No.
*  That's what it sounds like. Yeah.
*  Yeah, Darth Vader.
*  It does. I don't know how she perceives it.
*  Ask her.
*  I will.
*  She won't be honest.
*  She wants me on it. She calls it the tube of life. You have the tube of life on?
*  Oh, that's a good way of putting it.
*  I mean, she wants me to live.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah. So thank God.
*  Well, it really does.
*  I mean, she's sleeping right next to me. I'm glad she wants me to live.
*  She probably doesn't want you to snore either.
*  Yeah, I don't snore. I never snored.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. The sleep apnea that I had wasn't a snoring. It was more like,
*  choking kind of thing.
*  Yeah, the choking kind of thing where you stop breathing.
*  Right, right.
*  So it's not snoring.
*  Got it. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's scary stuff. A lot of people have it.
*  Well, yeah.
*  It's terrible for your health.
*  Yes, it's terrible for your health and you lose oxygen to your brain.
*  Yeah.
*  All these different things. So anyway, to leave that alone because I do do it.
*  I don't want to jinx myself out here. I'm very superstitious.
*  Really?
*  Very, very, very. So if I'm doing something right, I don't want to brag about it. I don't
*  want to do anything because then I'll think, I just-
*  You fucked it up.
*  Yeah, I don't want to fuck with things. An equilibrium has been found. Whatever that thing is,
*  I just quiet down on it.
*  So you find something that works. You find a good vibe and you stick with it.
*  I don't brag about it. I don't say a thing because then I think,
*  oh, maybe some will have a battle.
*  Right.
*  So I once was fat, actually.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. Chubb rolls, the guys that have rolls of fat and the thing. And I was with a girl who,
*  very, very serious young and everything. And we went to her beach. Her beach was called Little
*  Doom, Doom Beach, Little Doom. And she talks to these, she goes, I have to go talk to these guys.
*  And they were the cool surfer dudes. And it was like 25 years ago, 30 years ago. And she talks
*  to these guys and they start laughing. And I go, what are you guys laughing at? To her.
*  Because she's now left these and they're back there and I see a chorus of them kind of laughing.
*  They go, well, I guess they're laughing because they said, we never thought you'd be with like
*  a fat guy. And I thought, wow, they look at me and that's what they're seeing and they think
*  is funny. I got to fix this. And that was like the straight up October forever for me.
*  That is what's called fat shaming.
*  Fat shaming.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I didn't even know that. There's a phrase.
*  Yeah. You never heard of fat shaming?
*  Never heard it.
*  Well, it's a very controversial thought because some people think that fat shaming is terrible
*  and that you shouldn't do it to people. And other people say that fat...
*  It's true. It does work on certain people, but it makes people feel bad. And some people think
*  you should protect people from feeling bad. Whereas other people think you should tell them
*  that they're fat so they feel bad, so they act on it.
*  How do you see it? What does Joe Rogan call it?
*  I'm the latter. I think you should tell people that they're fat. If they want to know.
*  God, you said...
*  I don't think you should go after people and make them feel like shit.
*  If they want to know, you mean like...
*  If they want to know, I don't think you should protect them from it.
*  What's a... Okay, give me the signal of if you want to know. You're with some friend or...
*  Let's say you're with someone you only know a little bit.
*  I wouldn't say anything.
*  Then. Okay, so now you're with... So we're talking about relatives or... No,
*  you're talking about a husband, wife or boyfriend, girlfriend.
*  That's tough because they can resent you forever.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to be real careful, especially with the ladies.
*  And if you're a man and you resent your wife forever because she tells you you're fat,
*  you're probably not really a man.
*  That's really funny.
*  You might be a little bitch.
*  Oh my God. I can't believe you said that.
*  Really?
*  I mean, I like it because it's... I don't know what you...
*  You might be a little bitch.
*  You might be a little bitch. Yeah. If your wife says you're fat and...
*  Like, if my wife tells me I'm fat, I'm like, I'm not fat.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you talking about? It doesn't work.
*  Yeah.
*  It only works if you're fat. It's one thing if they're saying something about...
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I get it.
*  It's one thing if they're saying something about something you can't control.
*  Like, I wish you were black. I don't like white guys.
*  Okay, I have a question.
*  Then you feel terrible.
*  So it sounds like you have no boundaries on your show.
*  Right.
*  Okay. The guys that have really little dicks.
*  Ooh, that's a rough one.
*  I got it. I'm hearing you. So do you think the girl...
*  Do you think... And the girl and the guy are together...
*  Does the girl ever say... Do they ever... Does it...
*  I'm sure some girls do.
*  But here's the thing. Some girls...
*  I mean, we feel pretty rough guys we can talk about.
*  I think some girls who are... Some girls who are beautiful, beautiful girls...
*  Yeah.
*  ...are also lesbians.
*  Oh, yes, that's true. Yeah, yeah.
*  So some girls...
*  It's popular to be a lesbian.
*  Some girls who are beautiful girls are bisexual.
*  So they like girls and guys. Here's the question.
*  Would those girls be more likely to settle for a guy with a little dick?
*  Yes.
*  Or...
*  A rich guy with a little dick.
*  ...is it they like girls to be girls and like guys, no matter what, to have a big dick?
*  All right. I think they're like probably the latter.
*  Probably, unfortunately.
*  Evolution's a motherfucker. It really is.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that there's not a damn thing a person can do about that one.
*  You could suck fat out of your waist and stuff it in your ass.
*  You could get fake boobs. There's a lot of shit you can do.
*  If you got a little dick, that's a wrap, son.
*  It's a wrap, son.
*  There's not much you can do. I mean, there's some operations that can help you out a little.
*  Yeah, but I think that...
*  But for the most part...
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, cutting and dick, those two words don't go together well.
*  Do you think it makes guys crazy when they have...
*  Oh, for sure.
*  Yeah, I think it might too.
*  Guaranteed. It must. It must make them suicidal.
*  Whenever we start a throwing shit right now, that would mean like we had little dicks.
*  Maybe. It'd have to go crazy.
*  I think there's certain things that there's nothing you can do about it.
*  You just have to handle that roll of the dice, whatever you got.
*  I would guess.
*  Yeah, that's one of them.
*  But I mean, if things like CRISPR and genetic manipulation and things they're working on now,
*  that's probably one of the first things they're going to work on.
*  That's...
*  Wow, I never thought of this. You just hatched that right on the show today.
*  I think I've thought about it before.
*  Okay.
*  I'm going to be honest with you. But I don't think there's anything more profitable,
*  except beauty. Beauty would be incredibly profitable for people who were not born...
*  But they're both following that same department...
*  Yes.
*  Well, somewhat same area.
*  Yeah.
*  Like whatever it is cosmetics.
*  Yes.
*  Not just cosmetics, but even people that are not happy with their frame...
*  You're not operational.
*  No, no, you're not operational.
*  Maybe one day they'll be able to do something.
*  Yeah.
*  They shoot a little virus into your body and then all of a sudden...
*  Yeah, that'd be something.
*  It can happen. I mean, it's not insurmountable scientifically.
*  There's so many things that they're already doing with genetic manipulation.
*  That's not outside the realm.
*  It's not outside the realm. It seems possible.
*  Let's start calling our scientists right now.
*  Call them up.
*  Yeah, and see what they say.
*  So anyway, learn about fat shaming. I got that.
*  I can't believe you didn't know about that.
*  That's like in the zeitgeist right now.
*  Is it?
*  Yeah, people get mad at people for fat shaming.
*  Yeah. James Corden got mad at Bill Maher.
*  Bill Maher was mocking fat shaming.
*  He was like, maybe we should be shaming people more.
*  To him directly?
*  No, no.
*  Oh, just...
*  Bill Maher was talking about on his television show that maybe we should be shaming people more.
*  Oh, I see, I see, I see.
*  And then James Corden said, I have a problem with that.
*  And he's made a bunch of fat jokes, which I found were kind of weird.
*  Making fat jokes while you're being upset that someone's calling you fat.
*  That's interesting.
*  Yeah.
*  He thought he could get that one by you, but that one didn't get by you.
*  No, but he also does have a comedy talk show.
*  So it makes sense that he was making jokes and he's being comedic in his...
*  But he does have a comedy.
*  Yes, he does have a comedy.
*  It's not something that you can't fix.
*  And that's one of the things that people have a problem with being sympathetic about.
*  And I think that was Bill Maher's statement, because Bill is obviously a very slim man.
*  But it's not something you can't fix.
*  It's a problem to fix.
*  It's hard to fix.
*  It's hard probably to fix.
*  It requires discipline and also your gut biome is probably all screwed up from eating bad foods.
*  And you probably are accustomed to certain
*  certain behavior patterns that are unhealthy for you.
*  Yeah.
*  The times you're eating the kind of foods you're eating.
*  Yeah, all that.
*  I fixed mine with... But I mean, I wasn't fat in the...
*  You fixed it with shame.
*  I fixed it with shame. She shamed me and I started jumping rope.
*  And I started with... I do all everything with an achievable goal.
*  I just did a couple of minutes and I just kept going.
*  And then pretty soon, I did the rope that had a counter on it with those plastic beads
*  that gives a little weight and a nylon rope, a nylon cord.
*  And you could really get it going.
*  So I could do 200 beats a minute for 30 minutes.
*  And you're holding your body very tight.
*  So it actually... I didn't think of it that way, but it really strengthened my core.
*  Yeah. Jumping rope is amazing.
*  Yeah. So you obviously do...
*  Yeah, it's great.
*  You do it only to warm up or...
*  Mostly, yeah. I just do it to kind of get going.
*  Yeah. But for boxers, that's why the boxers use it so much.
*  It's a staple of boxing workouts.
*  Yes, it is. Yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah. You're always on your toes.
*  It keeps your calves conditioned and helps your body ability to shift movement.
*  I mean, strong calves and strong feet are very, very important for boxing
*  and anything that requires movement.
*  Football players, a lot of football players use jump rope
*  to help their ability to move side to side and help their mobility.
*  Yeah. Great workout too. Just great cardiovascular.
*  Yeah. It's very trendy right now too.
*  Is it? Another trendy thing.
*  Yes, another trendy thing.
*  The antidote to fat shaming, right?
*  There's a lot of videos online where people are doing these YouTube workouts of jumping rope.
*  And then they also have weighted ropes, which makes it more intense.
*  I used to weighted rope too.
*  Yeah. I used to go everywhere with these ropes.
*  So if I were in an airport, I'd be doing it.
*  I remember being on a tarmac in Greece in Athens waiting and I was doing it.
*  I would do it in the rain. I always did it. Every day I did it.
*  That I did without fail for almost 12 years.
*  Wow. Do you have a trainer, a personal trainer?
*  I do now. I didn't then, but I do now.
*  Because I think, well, it helps me so much.
*  Also, it helps me get into the gym without fail because I don't want to have him wait, Derek.
*  Shout out to Derek.
*  By the way, Derek, I shout out to Derek because I said something about I'm doing Joe Rogan and he
*  goes, oh, I listen to him all the time. I go, give me some insight. I really started collecting stuff.
*  He had, in fact, I could even show you. He wrote notes. I didn't read them because I didn't feel
*  like I had to. But literally, I'm sorry. But anyway, so Derek, okay. Oh, it's so long.
*  This is embarrassing. I didn't read it. So every morning it's good morning, bro, good morning,
*  bro, good morning, bro. That means he's here.
*  Good morning, bro.
*  And this is it. Hey, bro, you wanted a text about bro.
*  Is Derek a bro? He sounds like a bro.
*  He's a guy from Detroit. He says bro a lot. Yes.
*  I don't know how bro-y, but he does go, hey, bro. And actually, I've even said to him
*  a nice way, don't say hey, bro every morning. Because it just doesn't, he goes, hey, bro,
*  like that. And I want to say, you got to chop it up a little bit.
*  Makes it up. Hey, fella.
*  Makes it up.
*  Yeah. Is that bad? Is fella bad?
*  It'd be funny.
*  I call people fella all the time.
*  Yeah. I think it'd be funny you saying hey, fella. I like that. Like a strong guy going,
*  hey, fella. What's up, fella?
*  I'm going to try it.
*  I like fella.
*  Yeah, hey, fella. I mean, everyone, all your millions of listeners will know that I'm
*  ripping from you. Well, you gave it to me. You said you could say it.
*  That's not mine. Hey, fella is not mine. I say it all the time, but I don't know where I heard it from.
*  Gently or how do you?
*  Hey, fella. I say it like that. Like if I saw you, I'd be like, hey, fella.
*  I like it.
*  Now I'm thinking about it though. Now it sounds weird because I'm being self-conscious.
*  But you'll get it once I'm off the show. You know, tomorrow you're going to get back to it.
*  It'll go back to normal.
*  I like it. I'm going to feel that.
*  Yeah. It's not an issue.
*  Okay.
*  So what does Derek, what kind of advice did he give you?
*  On the show?
*  Yeah.
*  It said, I didn't look at it, but he gave me some advice. He said,
*  you know, he told me your background. First of all, I didn't realize the chronology of
*  your background. I didn't know he knew, he knows New Jersey, right? He just knew all the stuff.
*  So he did like Wikipedia.
*  Well, I think he did more than Wikipedia. No, no, no. I know that sounds like,
*  yes, that leads you to Wikipedia, but I popped that on him. So it wasn't like,
*  that was today. So he didn't like go, let me just tell you about it. He didn't do,
*  started looking at his smartphone. He knows your show really well. He's a, he's a guy's guy,
*  and he's a straight talker guy. He's a, yeah, he's a bro. No wonder he says bro.
*  That expression is weird because it used to be like, first of all, black dudes owned it.
*  Yeah.
*  Right? What up, bro? It was like that. And then it became white guys, like dorky white guys.
*  Okay, here, wait, I'm going to give it to you.
*  Right?
*  Because you seem interested in everything. Hey, I like the Rogan podcast because it's
*  casual conversation. He always sets the guest at ease and weaves through topics seamlessly. I'd
*  leave it alone. But he says everything is awesome. I mean, you're so, you're so,
*  you said it just like how you, I mean, perfect.
*  What kind of stuff does Derek have and you do?
*  Oh.
*  Physically.
*  Physically, well, okay. So I get in there and I do an elliptical, you know, for me,
*  I do it as high, as hard as you could possibly do it for 20 minutes. So it gets everything kind
*  of going and I've torn my rotary cuff. So it lubes that up a little bit and I have some injuries.
*  Have you ever done anything about it? The rotator cuff?
*  My doctor, you know him, Neil Eltrage.
*  Okay.
*  He does, you know, teams and stuff like that.
*  What did he say?
*  I don't need surgery. Eventually I will have to, eventually I might have to have surgery.
*  He says, I'm a surgeon. That's what I do, but I don't want you to have surgery. You don't need
*  it. You're going to have, you have the same strength you would have and it just will hurt a little bit.
*  And this is a rotator cuff tear.
*  It's a rotator cuff tear.
*  Have you ever had stem cells?
*  No. Is that a good idea?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, tell me how you do.
*  Definitely.
*  Okay. Oh, wow. I'm getting this from the man right on public.
*  I'll talk to you after it's over and I'll give you like places that you should go and talk to.
*  I had a full length rotator cuff tear and it's gone from stem cells.
*  Is there anything bad?
*  No, nothing negative.
*  Nothing negative?
*  Not for me. I know of no negative repercussions.
*  That's fantastic. I love knowing that.
*  Yeah. Certainly can help you for sure.
*  All right.
*  Matter of fact, the place where I go is, well, the place I go is in Santa Monica.
*  Right near me?
*  I've been going there for years.
*  What's the name of the place?
*  Lifespan Medicine.
*  Oh, it's not Mark Forrester.
*  No, no, no.
*  Lifespan.
*  Okay. I don't know.
*  I'll explain to you everything after the show.
*  I would love that. Thank you so much.
*  Okay.
*  But there's a lot of different treatments that they can do now that for soft tissue tears,
*  things like rotator cuffs and muscle tears and things along those lines,
*  it's amazing what they can do now.
*  Wow. Okay. That'd be awesome.
*  So what does he have me do?
*  I do a variety of different types of weights, curls. He mixes it up so it's sort of cross
*  training. So I'll do different things.
*  Okay. Cool.
*  I'll use those little slides that I love.
*  Oh yeah. That's great.
*  You put on your feet and there's four different things you can do. You open them, you do the
*  pushups and I like it because it's hard.
*  Do you do it in the morning?
*  I do it all in the morning. I do it at, it start at 6.30.
*  Wow.
*  He shows up at 7. This is what my, Monday, Wednesday, Friday goes like this for me.
*  From 6.30 to 7, I do my own stuff.
*  Elliptical.
*  Elliptical.
*  Just get going.
*  And a few other things. I might even do those little slides. He shows up at 7, hey bro. He's
*  hey broing me. And then we work out till 10 to 8. At 5 to 8, and then for five minutes he
*  puts that bolt on my legs and calves to make my muscles more relaxed.
*  Bolt. Are you talking about like a neuromuscular stimulator?
*  Yes. Thank you.
*  Electrical muscular stimulator.
*  Yeah. Electrical muscular stimulator. Yes, stimulator. And so we do that. And then
*  I run next door and I play tennis for an hour. Usually one-on-one tennis with a pro named Buster.
*  Shout out to Buster.
*  Shout out to Buster. So after that, so half hour elliptical, and then you do the weights.
*  You do this different kinds of physical workouts. And then you play tennis for an hour.
*  Tennis for an hour.
*  So, wow. So you're done like what, 10 a.m.?
*  No, I'm done exactly at 9 a.m. Sometimes I go, I have to leave a few minutes early, but
*  like 5 to 9 or 3 minutes to me.
*  So you run right from the gym straight over to tennis, so no missing time at all?
*  Right next door. No missing time.
*  Right next door.
*  Yeah, right next door. Skip Brittenham's house.
*  Okay, bam.
*  Bam for him. And so then I play tennis and then I rush back and I take shower really fast and then
*  I'm on the road going.
*  And then you do your work.
*  Now I go to work. But I'm up early actually at 5 o'clock.
*  Really?
*  I'm doing work and I'm looking at videos and I'm reading things and just bumping.
*  5 a.m., huh? Every morning that's your thing?
*  Every morning I just wake up at that time.
*  Coffee?
*  Coffee, yeah, lots of coffees. But I get excited about the day.
*  That's great.
*  I get really excited about the day.
*  That means you're doing what you're supposed to be doing.
*  Oh, good.
*  You enjoy what you're doing.
*  I really enjoy it.
*  You're excited about it.
*  I'm really excited about it. I really enjoy what I'm doing and I enjoy my life.
*  I love hearing that from people that are successful.
*  Oh, good.
*  Because it means you've found the thing that's fulfilling.
*  And it's continually fulfilling, which is the real problem with a lot of folks.
*  Sometimes things are fulfilling initially, but then they lose their luster.
*  But for you, as many movies as you made, as long as you've been in the game,
*  that you're still getting up at 5 in the morning, pumped up.
*  Super psyched.
*  Excited for the day.
*  Not feeling like I have to. I just want to.
*  That's awesome.
*  Thanks. Yeah. No, I mean, it's really true. I'm really excited.
*  And I, you know, my life's good. My kids are great.
*  They've gone through some changes. They all kids do.
*  And they're really in the right spot.
*  My youngest kid just turned 16. He plays football in Notre Dame.
*  He's not a big kid, but he wanted to own it. He wanted to own a choice.
*  And he's really disciplined.
*  Really, really. And he's just so not a pussy.
*  He's like, you know what I mean? He's just a tough guy.
*  That's awesome.
*  And I'm really proud of him and happy.
*  And, you know, I go through the rest of the three as well.
*  What are the kind of things do you like to do with your day?
*  I mean, you're obviously a guy that's into self-improvement.
*  Yeah.
*  So what are the kind of things you do meditate at all?
*  I do meditate. I do TM. I do it once a day, but I know you're supposed to do it twice a day.
*  Are you supposed to do it twice a day?
*  You're supposed to do it twice a day.
*  Morning and night? Is that how you're supposed to do it?
*  Something like that. Yeah.
*  But I don't, I can't pull that off. So I don't demand that upon myself.
*  I don't demand upon myself things that I can't quite do.
*  I know I should and I'm trying to.
*  Sorry, my friend Tom Poppett does TM and he won't tell me what his mantra is.
*  Will you tell me what your mantra is?
*  No.
*  Damn. Crazy.
*  I had two of them because actually, Depech Chopra, 20 years gave me one.
*  15 years, I have to be honest. 15 years.
*  Because I was really in need of meditation to stop these cycles.
*  He gave you a mantra.
*  He came to my office, taught me how to meditate and gave me a mantra.
*  And then I stopped, I dropped it and then recently, about five years ago,
*  Veronica, who's my wife, who's a big shout out to my wife.
*  A shout out to Veronica.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Third shout out today.
*  Yeah, that's good. And so she and I took a TM from Bob Roth.
*  Bob Roth is the founder of the David Lynch Meditation Center.
*  And he's a very good guy. Do we have to, we could, you'll tell me.
*  No, we're good.
*  Okay.
*  And so we do that. And sometimes we get Bob Roth on the phone because he lives in New York
*  and we'll just do it in the backyard and we'll have him on speaker and he'll talk through the
*  framework of it and then he's quiet and we're quiet and we meditate.
*  Oh, nice.
*  You meditate?
*  Yes. I just find it amazing how many TM people won't tell you their, whatever they're chanting.
*  I think we're told not to.
*  Yeah, but that's why it's weird.
*  It's like, what is it?
*  Why would, how does somebody have that much power over you? Right?
*  Is it an Avricadabra? Is it Alakazam? What are you saying?
*  I, the style of meditation I do, I just concentrate on my breath.
*  I think only about breathing in, only about breathing in and only about breathing out.
*  That's all I think about. So when I'm concentrating, I'm thinking only about the
*  breath in and only about the breath out. And it goes off the rails. I think about other things
*  and I have to get back on track. It always does. There's no way around that.
*  I think we're told it's okay though, right?
*  Yeah. Yeah. It's okay.
*  I used to think that it wasn't. I used to think, God, I'm weak. I can't stay on track.
*  But now I realize that's not the point. The point is to, it's just part of being a person.
*  Just let it happen. But keep, keep on track. Keep on track and you get off track.
*  Just get back on track again. Don't freak out about it.
*  Don't beat yourself up and all that stuff.
*  But I find it very cleansing.
*  Me too.
*  It does something. It does something. It opens you up in a very nice way.
*  Is yours, who's the person that turned you on to it or is it a type of meditation that
*  has a name to it or a person?
*  No, not really. It's just something, stuff I read about. And I started doing it in an
*  isolation tank. I started doing it, I have one here.
*  Really? So when I leave, we can look at the-
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sensory deprivation tank. Shout out to the float lab. Fourth shout out.
*  You ever been to one? Ever use one?
*  No.
*  Oh, they're amazing. You should get one. It's a great way to meditate.
*  There's portable ones too, aren't they? They're big.
*  Sort of, yeah.
*  I have done one. I have done one and I liked it. But I bet there's, I can't wait to see yours
*  because I bet there's a better way. I did it so makeshift.
*  Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah. The float lab is the most advanced ones and they have a place in
*  Westwood and in Venice. They have a place where you can go and rent it for an hour.
*  The best thing that I found was inside the tank was to just concentrate on breathing.
*  Breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth and in through the nose and out through
*  the mouth. That's all I would concentrate on is breathing in and breathing out, breathing in and
*  breathing out. And then I would kind of go into this trance when I was inside the tank. And so
*  then when I didn't have access to the tank, I started utilizing that outside of the tank.
*  And so I just kind of, when everything's, if something's bothering me, if I've got something
*  that, because I'm an obsessive person, so I get a thought in my head about something I'm working on
*  or something I'm trying to fix and I just start rolling over in my head to the point where I
*  can't get it, I can't get it away. So then the way I can cleanse that and put my brain back on a good
*  cycle is just concentrate on breathing. So I use the same method that I would use inside the tank
*  and I use it outside the tank. But I want to try TM. I'm going to try to do it this month while
*  we're doing these different classes this month. I'm going to try to take a class.
*  Tanner Iskra Maybe go to this guy, Bob Roth.
*  Pete Slauson Sure. Where's he at?
*  Tanner Iskra Well, he's, you know, kind of all over the, in New York.
*  Pete Slauson Okay. So, but he'll do it.
*  Tanner Iskra But he comes out here because he has many people in Los Angeles and he makes sure to
*  come I think once a month or something. Pete Slauson Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, I'll talk to you.
*  Yeah. I think he's, you know, for me, I think the best. I've met a few of them. But he made,
*  without saying take it seriously, he describes it in a way that I understood what it was and
*  he has some authority in him that made me take it seriously. Whereas the other times I didn't take
*  it quite as seriously. It's kind of important who introduces it to you, I think.
*  I think so too. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like what you were talking about earlier about people that
*  are really enthusiastic about something and really committed and disciplined about it that it's very,
*  it's very contagious. I think the same thing about meditation or about anything.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Tanner Iskra There's a certain energy you get when you're talking to someone who's really into
*  what they're into. If they're really into TM, like you'll get a feeling and then you'll be able
*  to recreate at least some of that when you do it on your own, I'd imagine.
*  Yes. Yeah. And yeah. Well, you'll like how it's described. It's, I don't know if you've,
*  basically, no, I'll let you do it yourself.
*  Pete Slauson Okay.
*  Tanner Iskra Now, what other stuff do you do in terms of self-improvement?
*  Tanner Iskra If you should ask Veronica. No, I'm, I think a little like you as I've researched you,
*  that I'm constantly reading things, like all of the time. Always non-fiction, however.
*  Pete Slauson No fiction at all?
*  Tanner Iskra No, I just, no.
*  Pete Slauson That's interesting for someone who produces a lot of fiction.
*  Tanner Iskra Well, I, what I like is I, yes, that's right. What I've found in my life,
*  for me, the foundational creative ingredients, or ingredients to a creative equation, like making
*  a movie, or a TV show, or painting, or is counterpoint. So, I have found that I'm dreamy
*  enough myself, you know, like I, you know, and I've read, of course, all Joseph Campbell stuff,
*  so I kind of understand formats of myths and the Here with a Thousand Faces, and I particularly
*  like underdog stories. There's so many types of underdog stories that it's, so anyway, so, I have
*  that basic knowledge, and then when I learn a subject, let's say I learn the subject of
*  architecture, or physics, or a little bit of chemistry, or whatever the, you know, it's all
*  like from an archaeological perspective, because it's all new to me. So, I found, for example, when
*  I produced the movie Eight Mile, which is about hip hop, right, it's about battles in Detroit,
*  first I thought, I can even go back further, I'll do this quickly though.
*  I thought I should get like the hottest, you know, video director, the coolest guy, and I won't say
*  those names, but there were the guys that were very visible at being the best at those videos,
*  those hot videos. And then it occurred to me, I should get somebody that approaches it, again,
*  archaeologically, where everything is a discovery. So, I hired someone that knew nothing about hip
*  hop, but was passionate about wanting to do the movie, and he was named Curtis Hanson, he's
*  deceased right now, but he won, I think, I believe two Oscars for LA Confidential. So, he was kind of
*  a classic American filmmaker that looked at everything was sort of a discovery lens, and
*  that's why you're able to, see, if I pick the video guy that thinks he knows everything about hip hop,
*  then all the little nuances that are new to the audience's eyes would have never been shot,
*  because he'd think, oh, everybody knows that stuff, that's the good stuff, you know?
*  And so, sometimes authority on top of authority doesn't work out well. And I found that
*  my career, all I did was write and produce comedies for the first 17 years of my
*  movie career, starting with Night Shift and then Splash and Parenthood and Nutty Professor and
*  Liar Liar and a lot of comedies, a lot of Five Eddie Murphy things, Jim Carrey three times,
*  you know? And what I found was Jewish writers, Christian actors. In the Jewish words, they go,
*  Jew writers, goyim actor. And goyim is like when Jewish people say it's the Christian,
*  you know, the Catholic guy. It's always, I made eight movies, I think, with Tom Hanks, but
*  he's like the Gary Cooper or he's the Christian guy with the Jewish writers. Always that works.
*  Why?
*  Jew on Jew, no good. Christian on Christian, not funny.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it just doesn't play.
*  What's wrong with Jew on Jew?
*  Combination.
*  Only one Jew on Jew kind of worked in the last...
*  Which one?
*  Woody Allen. And they weren't meteoric hits. He was just like, you know, he was sort of dominated
*  the ethos, you know, of comedy in the 70s and 80s. But it just didn't work. You can't really...
*  But I could name, I mean, Judd Apatow, talented Jewish writer, director. Usually he's got these
*  guys that are like, they're just not that. They're Catholic Christian guys, you know, like girls.
*  Right.
*  I mean, who's the chicken train wreck? Melissa McCarthy. McCarthy, she's Catholic.
*  Right.
*  He's a Jew. That's the counterpoint is what works.
*  Isn't train wreck Amy Schumer? Is it Melissa McCarthy too?
*  You might be right. It might be both.
*  It's both. Oh, thank God. Thank God we got tiebreaker here. So anyway.
*  Do you prefer to do comedy or do you prefer just a movie that interests you?
*  I prefer movies just interesting.
*  Just whatever it is.
*  But there was a point like at the end of these 17 years of like,
*  make, you know, there's a point where I definitely made a lot of, you know, did well financially,
*  I'm making these movies and I enjoy it. Because when you're around comedy, you're happy,
*  you're laughing. I mean, that's the whole vibe of the thing. But I thought, you just don't,
*  you cannot get enough respect just doing comedy. So I thought I'm gonna have to try to just do
*  dramas because I've come close, I got nominated, but that's as close as I got. There was no way
*  on Splash they were gonna pick. And the writers are the funny guys over there.
*  They picked Robert Benton, you know, like the guy that wrote A Place in the Heart,
*  you know, or Places in the Heart. And Bonnie and Clyde, like they picked that guy, the classy guys.
*  So I felt like if I wanna join the classy guys, I better start doing dramas. And then I did Apollo
*  13 and Ransom and a bunch of dramas.
*  That's interesting. So that's what motivated you to switch it up?
*  Yeah, that was what motivated me. I just couldn't take the abuse any longer.
*  I just couldn't.
*  The abuse of producing massively successful movies. What abuse.
*  Yeah, I mean, I felt grateful and stuff, but I just felt like I gotta...
*  I understand. You didn't feel like you got the respect you deserved for the work you...
*  They're so... Comedies are so hard. You do comedy. Comedy is the hardest thing because when it doesn't
*  work, you hear it. It's embarrassing. It's bad. Dramas, the great dramas, I could tell you all
*  those dramas that we've seen in the last five years, they go, it's great, it's brilliant. I mean,
*  I don't even know what happened on some of these things. They're so slow, right?
*  And there's no defining... You know, no one's... Oh, God, you hear everybody is really quiet.
*  They're quiet because they're asleep.
*  What did you think of The Joker?
*  Okay. I have to break The Joker down because I know a lot of people that are
*  moralistically very against it.
*  Yes.
*  You know, my generation is really mad at it.
*  I thought as a movie, that movie was really badass. That movie was... I thought it was really good.
*  Masterpiece.
*  Masterpiece. Oh, my God, those sequences and the going down the stairs and the music choices.
*  That was a masterpiece. It was amazing. I loved it.
*  Now, this other unit that you... If the movie is broken down into two units, the one is
*  the masterpiece we're calling of the movie itself, and then what are the themes that
*  are giving life to this movie? Or the purpose? What's the purpose? I mean, you could go, well,
*  that could be... There could be some bad stuff in there, you know? But I'm not deep enough to
*  identify it exactly. And having made so many movies, I can't be judgmental of it. I liked it.
*  And so I just feel like people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. That's what I think.
*  That's a good way of looking at it.
*  How do you see it? Because you asked...
*  I thought it was brilliant, but very disturbing.
*  But it was supposed to be disturbing. And I think they accomplished their goal
*  you know, with flying colors. I think it was a very, very unusual movie. Very difficult
*  to find any parallels with any other previous movie.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I thought it was fucking amazing. When I left, I didn't feel good.
*  I didn't feel like that. It was like, wow, what a great movie.
*  I was like, fuck. I walked out of the theater like, fuck.
*  Yeah, it just blows you away. It was so good.
*  And me and my wife talked about it for a long time.
*  How was she on it?
*  She loved it.
*  Oh, cool.
*  But it's not her kind of movie. But it was... there was something about it.
*  It was so well executed and Joaquin Phoenix was amazing.
*  Yeah. It was kind of operatic in some sense.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, where the music and everything was...
*  Yeah. I mean, the buildup to it too. There was so much going on and so much madness.
*  You understood. You felt empathy for this guy who was ultimately a monster and a murderer.
*  Spoiler alert. But you felt for him.
*  In that sense, they managed to navigate those incredibly treacherous waters brilliantly.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought it was fucking awesome.
*  Yeah, good. Me too.
*  I mean, that director's great.
*  Yeah. No, he's great.
*  And you, Phillips, is amazing.
*  I'm sure you know him.
*  I don't. I have friends who know him.
*  Oh, really? Yeah.
*  Yeah. My friend Brian Cowan, he was in The Hangover and he was in this movie briefly too.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  But I don't know him.
*  Yeah. So that's that.
*  That's that.
*  Yeah.
*  Brian, I gotta wrap this up.
*  Okay.
*  I really enjoyed it, man. Thank you very, very much.
*  Oh, you're so welcome.
*  I really appreciate it. I really enjoy talking to you.
*  Thanks. I feel really grateful to be on your show.
*  I feel really grateful to be able to talk to you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  All right. Thanks. Great.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  Wow.
*  How long do we talk for?
*  Wow. Wow. Wow. Thank you.
