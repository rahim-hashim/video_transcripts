*  I was like... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=52.0s)]
*  Bud lights? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=53.0s)]

*  I have no idea. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=56.0s)]
*  It became an abstract comment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=57.0s)]
*  The wedding. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=58.0s)]
*  I like wet my pants. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=59.0s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, I gotta give a speech. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=60.0s)]
*  I was like, I'll be alright. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=64.0s)]
*  I'm used to giving speeches. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=65.0s)]
*  I got up there, I was like... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=66.0s)]
*  Matt's wife, you're crazy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=69.0s)]
*  Matt, you're fucking nuts. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=70.0s)]
*  This thing might be crazy enough to work, folks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=71.0s)]
*  That was it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=73.0s)]
*  That was the whole speech. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=74.0s)]
*  This thing might be crazy enough to work. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=75.0s)]
*  Isn't it wild that so many people get married, but half of them fail? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=78.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=82.0s)]
*  You would think that more people would be like, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=83.0s)]
*  Matt. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=85.0s)]
*  I was my second time around. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=86.0s)]
*  That's 50 percent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=87.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=88.0s)]
*  I got married relatively young, though. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=89.0s)]
*  But I think then it's like a practice run. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=90.0s)]
*  You learn, oh, I can fix this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=92.0s)]
*  Let me try this again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=95.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=96.0s)]
*  Girlfriends, that was like free play mode. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=97.0s)]
*  That didn't even count. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=100.0s)]
*  Getting married is fucked up. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=101.0s)]
*  I got married the first time because I was like, yeah, I'll get married, I guess. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=104.0s)]
*  That was all I thought. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=108.0s)]
*  Cool. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=109.0s)]
*  When you got divorced, was it a pain in the ass? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=110.0s)]
*  Was it a big one? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=114.0s)]
*  It wasn't like, we didn't have kids, so it wasn't like. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=115.0s)]
*  But did you have to go through financial bullshit? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=118.0s)]
*  No, I didn't have any money. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=120.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=121.0s)]
*  Jackpot. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=122.0s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=123.0s)]
*  But watching people get drained, watching rich dudes get drained, and you see them going [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=124.0s)]
*  from not having to worry about anything to like, oh shit, how am I going to cover my bills? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=129.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=135.0s)]
*  I've seen that multiple times, man. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=136.0s)]
*  I've seen guys get divorced. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=138.0s)]
*  Just like Leon Edwards in the head. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=143.0s)]
*  It's a slap. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=145.0s)]
*  Just gets stiffened up. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=146.0s)]
*  It's miserable in depth. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=148.0s)]
*  It sucks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=149.0s)]
*  Even if you're not losing money, it's pretty shitty. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=150.0s)]
*  That's when we met. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=152.0s)]
*  That's when me and Matt met. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=153.0s)]
*  I was like, we started hanging out, and then he started getting a divorce, and I was right [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=154.0s)]
*  there for it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=158.0s)]
*  It was nice. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=159.0s)]
*  I moved from a marriage into a house of like five comedians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=160.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=164.0s)]
*  I was fucking sick. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=165.0s)]
*  On an air mattress. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=166.0s)]
*  Fuckin' nice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=167.0s)]
*  Did two years on an air mattress. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=168.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=169.0s)]
*  My air mattress would deflate, and I'd take it back to Walmart in the box, return it, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=170.0s)]
*  get a new one. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=173.0s)]
*  Bro, if my wife ever leaves me, I'm buying a ranch and inviting everybody to live there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=174.0s)]
*  Usually winning. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=180.0s)]
*  I'm just going to build you some houses. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=181.0s)]
*  I'm going to buy a giant chunk of land, and I'll build everybody a house. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=183.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=189.0s)]
*  It'd be like Stanhope's though. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=190.0s)]
*  There'd be a fire eventually. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, eventually. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, Stanhope's roof ceiling caught on fire. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=194.0s)]
*  It was in his attic. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=196.0s)]
*  What was going on up there? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=197.0s)]
*  It was in his attic. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=198.0s)]
*  It was an electrical fire. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=199.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=200.0s)]
*  That shit happened. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=201.0s)]
*  And he has like this metal roof, so it didn't ... the roof didn't catch fire. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=202.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=206.0s)]
*  So it just burned. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=207.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=208.0s)]
*  Is it fixed? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=209.0s)]
*  Or is it fucked for a while? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=210.0s)]
*  I doubt it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=211.0s)]
*  I think he's fucked for a couple of months. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=212.0s)]
*  Is he still living there? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=213.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=214.0s)]
*  I could see him living there with the big hole in the ceiling. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=215.0s)]
*  It would mean nothing to him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=216.0s)]
*  Fucking view to the sky. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=217.0s)]
*  It would mean nothing to him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=218.0s)]
*  It hardly rains out there anyway. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=219.0s)]
*  It gets cold at night. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=220.0s)]
*  It does get cold. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=221.0s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=222.0s)]
*  It's like near Mexico, but it gets cold as fuck. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=223.0s)]
*  The desert's weird. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=226.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've never been. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=227.0s)]
*  I want to go. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=228.0s)]
*  Why does it get so cold? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=229.0s)]
*  Does it not retain heat? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=230.0s)]
*  The sand. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=231.0s)]
*  It's probably the sand. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=232.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=233.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=234.0s)]
*  I'm guessing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=235.0s)]
*  I would guess it is too. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=236.0s)]
*  I feel like the sand is just fucking ... doesn't do shit. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=237.0s)]
*  Didn't Francis and Dono have a very similar story about crossing the Sahara? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=238.0s)]
*  When he crossed the Sahara, didn't he say it was really fucking cold at night? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=243.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's freezing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=246.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=247.0s)]
*  It's like sand doesn't retain heat. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=248.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=252.0s)]
*  It doesn't hold the heat? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=253.0s)]
*  Water just passes through. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=254.0s)]
*  It's fucking bullshit, actually. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=255.0s)]
*  It doesn't do a goddamn thing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=256.0s)]
*  It's hot as fuck and cold as fuck. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=257.0s)]
*  Lack of humidity. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=258.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=259.0s)]
*  Lack of humidity. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=260.0s)]
*  Lack of humidity. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=261.0s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=262.0s)]
*  The Sahara Desert used to be a fucking rainforest. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=263.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=268.0s)]
*  That's like the normal path of ... We look at stuff through such a narrow window that [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=269.0s)]
*  we think, oh, the desert's the desert. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=274.0s)]
*  The jungle's the jungle. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=276.0s)]
*  But there's a natural path that goes back and forth between things becoming rainforests [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=277.0s)]
*  and jungle and then things becoming sand. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=284.0s)]
*  Are we talking about the ice caps, too? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=286.0s)]
*  How apparently that was lush ... Someone told me that used to be lush forest that became ... We're [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=288.0s)]
*  in an ice age right now, technically. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=293.0s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=294.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=295.0s)]
*  I heard if we have polar ice caps, that's technically an ice age. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=296.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=299.0s)]
*  But I could be wrong. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=300.0s)]
*  My cousin told me that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=301.0s)]
*  Your cousin might be on Reddit. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=302.0s)]
*  His cousin definitely on Reddit. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=303.0s)]
*  He's definitely on Reddit. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=304.0s)]
*  He's definitely on Reddit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=305.0s)]
*  My cousin was reassuring me. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=306.0s)]
*  He's like, dude, the ice caps will fully melt and they'll just be lush and we'll all move [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=308.0s)]
*  up there, you know, hundreds of years. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=311.0s)]
*  Well, if global warming does keep accelerating, that's what everybody ... The people that have [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=313.0s)]
*  the most optimistic view of it, they say all the places that are wicked cold will just [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=318.0s)]
*  move into those. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=323.0s)]
*  I was listening to that guy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=324.0s)]
*  He was talking about how the Midwest, like Minnesota and shit, that'll be like Canada. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=325.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=328.0s)]
*  It's going to get a lot warmer. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=329.0s)]
*  I'm going to recross the Bering Strait. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=330.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=332.0s)]
*  You got to get back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=333.0s)]
*  I'm going back to Van Dia. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=334.0s)]
*  I think it's the opposite, though. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=335.0s)]
*  It's going to get more water. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=336.0s)]
*  You're looking at it wrong. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=337.0s)]
*  So I get my time ... If an ice age happens, then you can make that walk. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=338.0s)]
*  I need that. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=341.0s)]
*  That was my favorite at Jones. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=342.0s)]
*  He was like, fuck global warming. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=344.0s)]
*  Ice caps are growing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=347.0s)]
*  And everyone was like, shut the fuck up. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=348.0s)]
*  And then one quick Google, you're like, god damn it, he's right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=350.0s)]
*  They're growing? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=353.0s)]
*  Antarctica is. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=354.0s)]
*  So Leonardo DiCaprio is wrong? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=355.0s)]
*  Leonardo DiCaprio can get fucked. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=356.0s)]
*  He talked to the scientists. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=358.0s)]
*  All these fucking scientists, even the scientists don't agree because there's a mass group of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=359.0s)]
*  scientists that will tell you, and this is undeniable, that human beings have had a big [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=365.0s)]
*  impact on carbon emissions. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=369.0s)]
*  But you know that volcano that just erupted? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=372.0s)]
*  Where did that volcano just erupt? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=374.0s)]
*  I mean, Iceland had a big one. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=376.0s)]
*  There's one that just cracked. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=378.0s)]
*  Oh, recently? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=380.0s)]
*  Some guy put this ... I would like to find out if this is true. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=381.0s)]
*  Some guy put this on Twitter that there was more CO2 released from that one volcano erupting [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=383.0s)]
*  than everything human beings have ever done. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=390.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=393.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's true. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=394.0s)]
*  Sounds amazing, though. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=395.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=396.0s)]
*  I've heard math in the Barches-Pamilion. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=397.0s)]
*  Shut down some cucks with that kind of talk. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=398.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=400.0s)]
*  I'll be at the cellar trying to dish that out. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=401.0s)]
*  They'll be like, where did you find that? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=403.0s)]
*  I'll be like, don't worry about it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=404.0s)]
*  See, people worry about all kinds of things, but supervolcano is what you really should [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=405.0s)]
*  worry about. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=410.0s)]
*  They've knocked humanity down to just a few thousand people in the past. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=411.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=414.0s)]
*  Yeah, 70,000 years ago. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=415.0s)]
*  We've talked about it before. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=416.0s)]
*  I think it's called the Toba. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=417.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=418.0s)]
*  The Toba volcano? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=419.0s)]
*  It's a supervolcano. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=420.0s)]
*  I think it's near Indonesia. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=422.0s)]
*  Fact-checked volcanoes do not produce more CO2 emissions than human activity. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=426.0s)]
*  Reuters is on your ass, dude. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=430.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=432.0s)]
*  They probably typed that up in real time. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=433.0s)]
*  So this was June 8th of 2022. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=434.0s)]
*  So this was one, they were talking, god, I wish I saved it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=437.0s)]
*  It was one of those things I was looking on Twitter. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=441.0s)]
*  I'm like, wow, better Google that later. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=443.0s)]
*  That one little burp by Mount Etna has already come out. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=444.0s)]
*  But he said he was going to release data that proved this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=446.0s)]
*  I mean, my- [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=449.0s)]
*  One little burp by Mount Etna has already put more than 10 times the CO2 in the atmosphere [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=450.0s)]
*  than mankind has in our entire time on Earth. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=454.0s)]
*  Don't worry about a scam is in the works to tax your minuscule footprint. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=457.0s)]
*  Oh, this is a meme that someone put out? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=461.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=464.0s)]
*  I didn't see a meme. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=465.0s)]
*  I saw someone's tweet. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=466.0s)]
*  They might have stole the meme and tried to be clever. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=467.0s)]
*  Or the meme might have come from this guy's tweet as well. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=469.0s)]
*  Same allegation has been shared here in 2016. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=473.0s)]
*  An iteration posted on Twitter June 2nd has retweeted nearly 9,000 times. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=476.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=483.0s)]
*  It might all be horse shit. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=484.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, but my thing is- [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=486.0s)]
*  That's a lot though. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=488.0s)]
*  That looks like a lot of stuff. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=489.0s)]
*  That looks like a lot of stuff. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=490.0s)]
*  It's a big ass cloud. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=491.0s)]
*  I'd say that's 40% CO2 if I had to put my eye on that. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=492.0s)]
*  Yeah, if I had to just one glance at it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=494.0s)]
*  It's just funny to be like, nah, the Earth's not warming up. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=496.0s)]
*  Does anyone know the temperature of the entire Earth? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=499.0s)]
*  Both people are silly. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=503.0s)]
*  The people with limited research that say it's nothing to worry about [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=505.0s)]
*  and the people with limited research that say we're all going to die. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=508.0s)]
*  Both people are silly. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=512.0s)]
*  The ones that make the most sense to me. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=513.0s)]
*  I had a guy named Steve Kuhnen on the podcast. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=516.0s)]
*  He's a physicist who got into- that's what he is, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=518.0s)]
*  Kuhnen? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=523.0s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=524.0s)]
*  And he- I forget how he was tasked with going about looking into climate change, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=525.0s)]
*  but what he found was that the periods of ups and downs have always existed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=534.0s)]
*  This idea that the Earth has ever been at a stable temperature that stays like this, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=539.0s)]
*  that's just not the case. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=544.0s)]
*  It goes up and it goes down, and it seems like it's always done that forever, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=546.0s)]
*  and it varies wildly. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=551.0s)]
*  They have these big giant spikes up and down, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=553.0s)]
*  but this is over thousands and thousands of years, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=556.0s)]
*  Maybe millions of years, where they're predicting how long. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=559.0s)]
*  But for sure, we're having an impact. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=563.0s)]
*  But the question's like, how much impact? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=565.0s)]
*  What is the difference? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=567.0s)]
*  And would it be happening anyway? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=568.0s)]
*  Would it be warming up anyway? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=570.0s)]
*  If we didn't do anything to fuck up the environment, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=572.0s)]
*  then we could just look at the environment for what it is. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=575.0s)]
*  We could say, oh, look, it looks like it's warming up. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=577.0s)]
*  Well, we know we're not doing anything about that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=579.0s)]
*  If we had no impact, but we know we have an impact. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=582.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing no one thinks about is we were like- [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=585.0s)]
*  we escaped from nature in like a blind rush out of just being constantly destroyed by floods [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=587.0s)]
*  and eaten by predators, and we set up this whole system [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=593.0s)]
*  so we can eat and not all die. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=596.0s)]
*  Everyone's like, fuck this. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=598.0s)]
*  I mean, we can definitely tweak it to be better, but Jesus Christ, man. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=600.0s)]
*  A little bit of appreciation. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=602.0s)]
*  A little bit of appreciation of what we've done. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=604.0s)]
*  It's amazing what people have done, but yet for sure, we could do a lot of the shit better. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=606.0s)]
*  Do plastic bags. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=611.0s)]
*  They could figure out different technology for something that doesn't sit in the ocean. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=612.0s)]
*  Well, they can make biodegradable plastic now. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=615.0s)]
*  Why don't they? That's my thing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=617.0s)]
*  That's a practical- [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=619.0s)]
*  Plastics, as they are now, I think most of them are just made with plastic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=620.0s)]
*  Most of them are just made with fossil fuels, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=626.0s)]
*  Most plastics? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=627.0s)]
*  But I know they're putting out biodegradable plastics that are made from plant. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=628.0s)]
*  You can actually make plastic from hemp, believe it or not. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=634.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=636.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was wild. I read that, I was like, what? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=637.0s)]
*  I don't like it. I gotta bring my own bags to my grocery store, and I forget them every time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=640.0s)]
*  So then I buy one, and now I've got a whole bag. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=644.0s)]
*  I've got piles of bags in my apartment. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=647.0s)]
*  Get a stick with a bandana. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=649.0s)]
*  I might, dude. Get some beans, dude. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=651.0s)]
*  It is a good move. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=653.0s)]
*  Get my girlfriend out for beans. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=654.0s)]
*  It is a good move that they just don't just give away bags anymore. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=656.0s)]
*  Even though it's real convenient, it's probably better if you bring a bag. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=659.0s)]
*  It is. But who's gonna remember that? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=664.0s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=666.0s)]
*  I walk outside my front door and go, fuck, I forgot a bag. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=668.0s)]
*  Isn't that a thing that we can adjust to? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=671.0s)]
*  We'll adjust to it, yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=673.0s)]
*  It depends on if you're a walking apartment person versus someone who drives. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=675.0s)]
*  If you're driving to the supermarket, it makes sense to just leave a bag in your trunk. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=679.0s)]
*  But if you're a walking person in an apartment, and you're in the city, and you forget a bag, that's annoying. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=683.0s)]
*  Or just do paper bags and burn them. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=689.0s)]
*  Yeah, but then you kill trees. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=691.0s)]
*  What about the emissions, dude? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=693.0s)]
*  They disappear. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=694.0s)]
*  It goes up in the air. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=695.0s)]
*  It goes away? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=696.0s)]
*  It goes straight through space. It goes out into space. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=697.0s)]
*  I don't want these fucking pussies talking about these. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=700.0s)]
*  Global warming is fucking not real. I'm sick of it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=703.0s)]
*  I had Randall Carlson on my podcast. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=707.0s)]
*  He's an expert in collisions, like cosmic collisions on Earth. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=709.0s)]
*  And he said, global warming is not good. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=714.0s)]
*  But what's really bad is global cooling. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=718.0s)]
*  He goes, global cooling is terrifying. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=720.0s)]
*  Ice ages? That's where everybody dies. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=723.0s)]
*  That's where there's no food. That's where you're fucking starving to death. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=726.0s)]
*  Dude, how do we make it? How do we make it through the ice age? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=730.0s)]
*  How do we? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=734.0s)]
*  Well, you have to move. You moved. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=735.0s)]
*  Or the hardiest of hardy people they hunted and gathered, like the Inuit, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=738.0s)]
*  they basically can't grow any vegetables. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=744.0s)]
*  What a fucking bullshit life. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=747.0s)]
*  What a scary life, dude. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=749.0s)]
*  In a fucking ice cave. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=750.0s)]
*  You're living in that ice house, covered in animal skins. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=751.0s)]
*  Hopefully you stab something in the next month. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=754.0s)]
*  And you're just looking for fat. You're just looking for blubber to eat. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=759.0s)]
*  Because that's what your body uses for fuel. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=760.0s)]
*  Imagine how much you could just slide on ice though. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=762.0s)]
*  Probably want to slide in. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=765.0s)]
*  They're fucking in there. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=767.0s)]
*  They're fucking in there? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=768.0s)]
*  Get in there together. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=770.0s)]
*  Imagine fucking in an ice house that you made with a fire in the center of it, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=773.0s)]
*  on animal skins of animals you killed, knowing that there's no doctors anywhere. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=779.0s)]
*  So if your woman gets pregnant, you're pulling it out of there, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=784.0s)]
*  in the middle of the tundra with polar bears around your ice house. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=790.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking crazy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=793.0s)]
*  They had no concept of doctors. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=795.0s)]
*  Of course there were people that figured shit out. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=797.0s)]
*  But I'm saying he wasn't like, fuck, I wish I had a doctor. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=801.0s)]
*  Dude, if you grow up like that, that's how you live. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=804.0s)]
*  And people are adaptable as shit. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=807.0s)]
*  I had this dude on Sunny from Best Ever Food Review yesterday, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=809.0s)]
*  and he went and lived with these tribal people and hunted with them and ate what they ate. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=813.0s)]
*  He reviews exotic foods from all over the world. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=819.0s)]
*  And he's with these tribal people slurping blood out of the carcass of a goat that they just shot. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=822.0s)]
*  They're slurping it up with their hands. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=829.0s)]
*  And you can tell he's barely getting through it on camera. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=832.0s)]
*  But that's their normal life. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=835.0s)]
*  For them, it wasn't gross at all. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=837.0s)]
*  It was totally normal. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=839.0s)]
*  This is how you get food. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=840.0s)]
*  You don't let the blood go to waste. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=842.0s)]
*  You slurp it out of the body cavity. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=844.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=846.0s)]
*  The endothelial's healthcare skills helped them survive through the Ice Age. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=848.0s)]
*  What? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=852.0s)]
*  Is that a trap? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=853.0s)]
*  No, they said they found people with broken bones. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=855.0s)]
*  They're not sure exactly how it did it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=857.0s)]
*  But since they were in such small tribes, if they lost someone, it would have been catastrophic to the group. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=859.0s)]
*  So they all had to work to keep everybody alive closer, too. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=863.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they probably eventually figured out how to set an arm, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=866.0s)]
*  And put a stick there and tie it down. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=870.0s)]
*  Just sitting in a fucking igloo. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=873.0s)]
*  Bro, they don't always grow back good. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=876.0s)]
*  There's a lot of like... [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=878.0s)]
*  They have some mangled arms, dude. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=880.0s)]
*  There's a lot of bones they found of people. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=882.0s)]
*  That's a hard life. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=884.0s)]
*  Monsters, tigers. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=886.0s)]
*  You get shit bit off all the time. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=888.0s)]
*  I'm thinking more about your cave wife. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=890.0s)]
*  Before women had words, and you get home, they'd be like... [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=892.0s)]
*  No words. Just... [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=895.0s)]
*  Just no words. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=897.0s)]
*  You'd be like... [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=899.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=901.0s)]
*  I bet they were horny all the time. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=903.0s)]
*  But all they did was just fuck. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=905.0s)]
*  Just fucking throw spears and go gather food. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=907.0s)]
*  Yeah, the more we're talking about it, the more I'm coming around on this. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=910.0s)]
*  How sick that shit would have been. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=913.0s)]
*  They must be so primal, those people. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=915.0s)]
*  You don't know where the fuck you are. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=917.0s)]
*  Like the earliest early people. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=919.0s)]
*  People from like 300,000 years ago, whatever a person was back then. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=921.0s)]
*  They must be so horny. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=924.0s)]
*  Yeah, well that's why they had all this... [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=926.0s)]
*  Carrying shit. Just... [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=928.0s)]
*  Looking to fuck and throw spears and fighting off animals. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=930.0s)]
*  That's why they had all those fucked up rituals. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=933.0s)]
*  Because in their world, violence they just put on a pedestal. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=935.0s)]
*  That was the coolest thing. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=938.0s)]
*  That was the ultimate life force back then. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=940.0s)]
*  Just getting squashed by animals and rocks. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=942.0s)]
*  They would reenact it all the time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=944.0s)]
*  Could you imagine if you could go back and get one of them Neanderthal dudes [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=946.0s)]
*  and enter him into a wrestling tournament? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=949.0s)]
*  I'll just teach him a few moves. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=951.0s)]
*  He'd bite right away. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=953.0s)]

*  Dude is a beast. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=959.0s)]
*  But like a Neanderthal is probably so much stronger than people. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=961.0s)]
*  Their bones are different. They're built different. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=965.0s)]
*  They're like 5'7", 200 plus pounds. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=967.0s)]
*  They're built like chimps. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=970.0s)]

*  Do you think that they fucked us or we fucked them? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=978.0s)]
*  We seduced them. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=980.0s)]
*  I think we seduced them for sure. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=982.0s)]
*  Imagine me laying in weight dude. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=984.0s)]
*  One of those guys came by. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=987.0s)]
*  Plus back then having a powerful woman would be very attractive [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=989.0s)]
*  because then you'd have kids that could survive. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=993.0s)]

*  Dude, they tossed an 80-year-old woman off of Jamie. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1224.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm all in. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1228.0s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1229.0s)]
*  Have you taken your pants off the turban? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1230.0s)]
*  No. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1232.0s)]
*  This is Saudi Arabia. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1233.0s)]
*  Saudi Arabia saw this and was like, we're in. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1234.0s)]
*  We're very interested. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1236.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1237.0s)]
*  She's got a neck brace on. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1238.0s)]
*  This is a long bit, so I'll kind of zoom ahead. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1240.0s)]
*  There's La Mer. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1243.0s)]
*  There's a match. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1244.0s)]
*  It brought her out. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1245.0s)]
*  So she's standing up there watching. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1246.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1248.0s)]
*  And she's yelling and screaming. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1249.0s)]
*  And so they roll her. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1252.0s)]
*  The Dudley boys. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1255.0s)]
*  The Dudley boys are so nice. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1257.0s)]
*  Oh, Bubba Ray Dudley. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1259.0s)]
*  So granted that... [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1260.0s)]
*  What are they going to do to this old lady? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1261.0s)]
*  I think he's on a powerbomb. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1263.0s)]
*  Oh, he's trying to push her down the ramp. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1265.0s)]
*  What was he doing? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1267.0s)]
*  I think he was going to run right off the... [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1268.0s)]
*  Crowd, crowd. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1270.0s)]
*  Oh, no, dude. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1272.0s)]
*  I wouldn't do that. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1273.0s)]
*  Dude, this is the arena. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1275.0s)]
*  Spill her blood. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1277.0s)]
*  This is hilarious. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1280.0s)]
*  Feeder to the lions. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1281.0s)]
*  This is actually a great... [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1282.0s)]
*  This is a great idea. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1284.0s)]
*  This is funny. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1285.0s)]
*  This is. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1287.0s)]
*  You'll see, it's really not that funny. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1288.0s)]
*  Everyone's thought about doing this. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1290.0s)]
*  No, no! [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1294.0s)]
*  What the fuck, man. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1298.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1300.0s)]
*  He just did a lateral drop on a table. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1302.0s)]
*  Dude, powerbombing your grandma? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1305.0s)]
*  What do they call that? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1307.0s)]
*  It's a powerbomb. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1308.0s)]
*  That was a powerbomb through a table. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1309.0s)]
*  Dude, the fact that your brain carried this for 22 years. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1311.0s)]
*  This has been in your brain for 22 years. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1314.0s)]
*  Bro, what kind of damage did that lady's brain do? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1316.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't care what you say. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1319.0s)]
*  That lady got impact from that. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1321.0s)]
*  There was some impact involved in that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1324.0s)]
*  Damn, I wonder if there was a nursing home pipeline in WWE. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1327.0s)]
*  She's not protected there. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1330.0s)]
*  Look at her hands. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1331.0s)]
*  That's a real old lady. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1332.0s)]
*  Bro, that probably took memories from her. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1334.0s)]
*  He's talking shit? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1336.0s)]
*  Oh no, that's Mark Henry. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1337.0s)]
*  He's saying, I love you. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1338.0s)]
*  Are you okay? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1339.0s)]
*  Are you dead? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1340.0s)]
*  Dude, they killed an old lady. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1341.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1342.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1343.0s)]
*  That's fun. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1344.0s)]
*  He's rubbing his head. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1345.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to get this pinned on me. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1346.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1347.0s)]
*  What the fuck, man. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1348.0s)]
*  I'm getting arrested. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1350.0s)]
*  Damn, dude. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1352.0s)]
*  So yeah, WWE's not afraid to put hands on women. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1353.0s)]
*  It's coming back. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1356.0s)]
*  It's coming back. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1357.0s)]
*  They did get away from it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1358.0s)]
*  Now with the Saudis, we might be back to the classics. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1359.0s)]
*  Putting geezers through tables. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1362.0s)]
*  It's fucking crazy. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1364.0s)]
*  That was probably in Rochester, New York. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1366.0s)]
*  Rochester, are you ready for Raw? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1369.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1371.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so nuts. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1373.0s)]
*  Have you ever go to one of those, wrestling? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1375.0s)]
*  No, Tony's been trying to get me to go to WrestleMania forever. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1377.0s)]
*  It's so fucking fun. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1380.0s)]
*  Forever. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1381.0s)]
*  But now that the Saudis bought it, allegedly. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1382.0s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1384.0s)]
*  What's the... [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1385.0s)]
*  Still not real? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1386.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1387.0s)]
*  Did we snope that yesterday? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1388.0s)]
*  They were still investigating it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1390.0s)]
*  It's going to be cool. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1392.0s)]
*  If the Saudis get it, there's a chance it gets better. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1393.0s)]
*  Who owns it? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1395.0s)]
*  Does Vince McMahon still own it now, or is he focused on this? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1396.0s)]
*  Well, they kicked him out because he got busted with a bunch of floozies. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1398.0s)]
*  Yeah, he is. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1400.0s)]
*  What? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1401.0s)]
*  Paying a bunch of ladies with company cash. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1402.0s)]
*  Who would have thought all that money went to that? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1404.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1406.0s)]
*  Got to keep people... [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1407.0s)]
*  Look, if you look like that and you're seven years old and you're the head of the WWE, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1408.0s)]
*  you're slinging dick. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1412.0s)]
*  What do you want him to do? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1413.0s)]
*  What do you want him to do? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1414.0s)]
*  I'd be more disappointed if he wasn't slinging dick. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1415.0s)]
*  If he was a faithful married man. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1417.0s)]
*  He's a full married man. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1419.0s)]
*  He's a gigantic barbarian man who's like 79 years old and works out with a chain around his neck. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1420.0s)]
*  You ever see how jacked he is? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1425.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's fucking... [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1427.0s)]
*  Show me a picture of Vince McMahon jacked. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1428.0s)]
*  No, still jacked. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1431.0s)]
*  No, I watched him get stunted at WrestleMania. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1432.0s)]
*  It's tough, dude. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1434.0s)]
*  Did you see the... [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1435.0s)]
*  LaMare got me. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1436.0s)]
*  LaMare was hanging out with me and he was like, it's WrestleMania today. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1437.0s)]
*  And I was like, I don't give a fuck. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1440.0s)]
*  And then he started putting up old highlights to get pumped for the thing. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1442.0s)]
*  Dude, I used to love Stone Cold. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1445.0s)]
*  My bad. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1448.0s)]
*  It was... [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1449.0s)]
*  Look, dude, look at that. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1450.0s)]
*  Dude, he's super jacked and he's 150,000 years old. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1452.0s)]
*  That's from the front, dude. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1455.0s)]
*  See him from the side. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1456.0s)]
*  He's got the fucking... [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1457.0s)]
*  What does he got? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1458.0s)]
*  He's hunched, dude. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1459.0s)]
*  Oh my god, dude. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1460.0s)]
*  That's pretty new. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1462.0s)]
*  That's what's in a magazine. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1463.0s)]
*  Let him do his thing. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1464.0s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not truly criticizing, but when he got stunned... [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1465.0s)]
*  I know, yeah, of course not. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1469.0s)]
*  I'm talking about having... [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1470.0s)]
*  I'm talking about his extramarital affairs. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1471.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1473.0s)]
*  You're giving him a hard time about his physique, Shane? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1474.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1476.0s)]
*  Joe? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1477.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1478.0s)]
*  That sounded kind of personal. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1479.0s)]
*  I'm stunned. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1480.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got stunned. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1481.0s)]
*  He looks good. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1482.0s)]
*  He looks good. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1483.0s)]
*  I think he's 80-something years old. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1484.0s)]
*  Well, that's incredible. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1488.0s)]
*  He looks better than Schwarzenegger. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1489.0s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1490.0s)]
*  Let's guess. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1491.0s)]
*  77. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1492.0s)]
*  I say he's... [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1493.0s)]
*  You just saw it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1494.0s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1495.0s)]
*  Did it come up? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1496.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1497.0s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1498.0s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1499.0s)]
*  I say he's 80 years old. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1500.0s)]
*  Review the tape. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1501.0s)]
*  I didn't even see it. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1502.0s)]
*  What's this guy? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1503.0s)]
*  You're saying he... [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1504.0s)]
*  He said he looks like shit. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1505.0s)]
*  No, he was... [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1506.0s)]
*  Because back like 10 years ago, he was like... [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1507.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was yoked. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1509.0s)]
*  Covered fucking men's health. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1510.0s)]
*  Back when he was 70. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1511.0s)]
*  Back when he was 70. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1512.0s)]
*  And I thought that was going to be the same guy that came out in WrestleMania. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1513.0s)]
*  And now you can see its age. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1516.0s)]
*  You can see its wearing on him. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1517.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1518.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1519.0s)]
*  He got stunned and it was... [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1520.0s)]
*  You're saying he recovered from the stunner. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1521.0s)]
*  He got stunned and couldn't go down. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1522.0s)]
*  He hated Stone Cold, bro. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1524.0s)]
*  Stone Cold stole his youth. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1525.0s)]
*  But, Jamie, how old is he? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1527.0s)]
*  77. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1528.0s)]
*  How old is it? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1529.0s)]
*  77. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1530.0s)]
*  77. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1531.0s)]
*  Yes, he looks great. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1532.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1533.0s)]
*  He looks fucking great for 77. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1534.0s)]
*  77, you're supposed to be a dead man. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1535.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to be pro wrestling. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1536.0s)]
*  He would whoop my ass. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1537.0s)]
*  Obviously, he would beat my ass. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1538.0s)]
*  Dude, he would slap me. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1539.0s)]
*  Bro, he's older than my mom. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1540.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1541.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1542.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1543.0s)]
*  Not a lot of fucking hip behind that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1544.0s)]
*  Not much going on. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1545.0s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1546.0s)]
*  Probably threw him into the turnbuckle. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1547.0s)]
*  Pat McAfee goes down. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1548.0s)]
*  McAfee goes hard on this. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1549.0s)]
*  He sells it very well for him. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1550.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1551.0s)]
*  This isn't real? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1552.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1553.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying, Jamie? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1554.0s)]
*  When we saw... [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1555.0s)]
*  When we saw... [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1556.0s)]
*  When we saw... [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1557.0s)]
*  When we saw... [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1558.0s)]
*  When we saw... [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1559.0s)]
*  When we saw... [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1560.0s)]
*  When we saw him, he was in a neck brace. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1564.0s)]
*  He's just gone through a table. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1565.0s)]
*  McAfee? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1566.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1567.0s)]
*  Yeah, don't do that, kids. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1568.0s)]
*  Those guys get busted up more than anybody. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1571.0s)]
*  When I've had those pro wrestlers in here, like Diamond Dallas Page, his body had been [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1573.0s)]
*  through fucking hell. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1578.4s)]
*  That's why he invented that yoga. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1580.0s)]
*  He's got his own yoga system, and he's helped all these wrestlers that are all fucked up [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1581.96s)]
*  completely rehabilitate their body and get their motion back. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1586.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1590.16s)]
*  Damn. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1591.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1592.16s)]
*  And he's done more yoga. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1593.3200000000002s)]
*  The dude's in incredible shape, man. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1594.3200000000002s)]
*  I haven't seen him. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1596.0400000000002s)]
*  He can stand up, grab his foot, and do a split. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1597.0400000000002s)]
*  I remember DDP. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1599.2s)]
*  He ruled. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1600.2s)]
*  And he's in his 60s. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1601.2s)]
*  He can grab his foot standing up right now, no warm up, and he holds it up like a split. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1602.2s)]
*  Not bullshitting. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1607.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1608.16s)]
*  Yeah, he did it in my studio. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1609.16s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1610.16s)]
*  I was like, that's insane. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1611.16s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1612.16s)]
*  I watched my dad do that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1613.16s)]
*  He was showing him some of his exercises. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1614.16s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck, dad? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1615.16s)]
*  The guy's in amazing shape, and his back is fucked. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1616.16s)]
*  Like technically, he should need surgery. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1618.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1620.9s)]
*  He's got a little bone on bone and shit, but he does that yoga routine every day, and it [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1621.9s)]
*  keeps him healthy and mobile and he's not in pain. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1626.7800000000002s)]
*  The guy, it's incredible. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1629.66s)]
*  He's so flexible. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1630.66s)]
*  It's like, how did you do this? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1631.66s)]
*  When you see him move around, you're like, you are a pro wrestler, and look at you. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1633.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1637.14s)]
*  He hit Beetlejuice with a guitar. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1638.14s)]
*  Did he? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1639.14s)]
*  Beetlejuice from the Howard Stewart Show? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1640.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1641.14s)]
*  He hit it with a guitar? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1642.14s)]
*  He smashed it with a guitar. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1643.14s)]
*  No. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1644.14s)]
*  Now he's doing yoga. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1645.14s)]
*  What a world. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1646.14s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1647.14s)]
*  I guess if you're dedicated every day to yoga, you'd probably help your body. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1648.14s)]
*  I think those guys, if you're that busted up, you kind of have to do something every day. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1651.38s)]
*  Otherwise, you're not going to be mobile. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1655.98s)]
*  You really have to fix ... If you just start eating pain pills, which a lot of them do, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1658.42s)]
*  that's a dark road. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1663.9s)]
*  You've got to think about how many times a year those guys were on the road. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1664.9s)]
*  I talked to Jake the Snake, and he was explaining his evolution in the game and how long it [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1669.8200000000002s)]
*  took him and all the road gigs and shit. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1675.5800000000002s)]
*  Dude, those guys were doing 300 nights a year. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1678.26s)]
*  Every day. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1681.5800000000002s)]
*  Never helped. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1682.5800000000002s)]
*  Every day, they're smashing into each other and slamming each other. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1683.5800000000002s)]
*  Some of them, they don't like each other. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1688.22s)]
*  They want to hit each other hard. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1690.06s)]
*  I can only imagine the real feuds going on. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1691.82s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1695.5s)]
*  I was just talking to somebody about it. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1696.5s)]
*  Seriously, fuck you, brother. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1697.82s)]
*  I'm not a fuck dude. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1698.82s)]
*  No, they're all fucking ... Especially back then. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1699.82s)]

*  They were, for like five straight years, they hated each other. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1706.3s)]
*  Was it Jake the Snake, or was it the Undertaker that had the broken eye socket? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1709.06s)]
*  Was it the Undertaker? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1714.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1715.5s)]
*  Wasn't there like the Undertaker? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1716.5s)]
*  He had a special mask he had to wear for a while. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1717.5s)]
*  He shattered his fucking eye socket in the middle of a match. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1719.5s)]
*  This Mexican dude landed on his face. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1723.78s)]
*  His move, instead of fucking your face, he would drop his butt on your face. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1725.98s)]
*  So he drops his butt on ... Who was it? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1729.06s)]
*  It was like a famous guy. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1731.74s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1733.74s)]
*  Mysterio? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1734.74s)]
*  A giant guy. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1736.22s)]
*  Dude, that's crazy. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1737.22s)]
*  This dude landed his butt on his face and broke his eye socket. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1738.22s)]
*  So he's like, ah! [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1742.22s)]
*  He's got to finish the match. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1743.22s)]
*  He's got to finish this match with a broken eye socket. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1745.34s)]
*  Is that why his eyes started going up like this all the time? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1746.9s)]
*  Well, he actually said he ran into a clothesline. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1749.9s)]
*  I'm reading a quote from him. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1752.3s)]
*  Oh, ran into a clothesline. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1753.3s)]
*  It was that guy, Mabel. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1754.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1756.3s)]
*  I thought the guy landed on his face. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1757.3s)]
*  Didn't you think so? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1759.3s)]
*  He said he was six foot eight, 500 pounds. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1760.3s)]
*  I ran straight into what was supposed to be a clothesline, but he was so gassed, and I [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1761.3s)]
*  ended up hitting a spot in his arm. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1764.86s)]
*  Actually, Jamie, I think he broke his eye socket twice. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1766.86s)]
*  I think if I remember correctly, he broke both eye sockets. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1771.3s)]
*  Well, according to this, it says this is what he said on the Joe Rogan experience. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1775.3s)]
*  Oh. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1780.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1781.3s)]
*  Both eye sockets. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1782.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1783.3s)]
*  See, that's right. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1784.3s)]
*  One was because the guy was completely out of shape, a lot of similarities. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1785.8999999999999s)]
*  The other one, I think, was the butt to the face. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1788.74s)]
*  I think he's saying he broke both because we showed another one that he did where the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1793.3s)]
*  guy wasn't as big who landed on his face. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1797.62s)]
*  I might be remembering this wrong. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1800.3s)]
*  I have a very limited memory for pro wrestling. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1802.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1804.3s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1805.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1806.3s)]
*  They threw the grandma to the table. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1807.3s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1808.3s)]
*  The grandma to the table was pretty awesome. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1809.3s)]
*  I'll delete that by the end of the week. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1810.3s)]
*  By the end of the week, I'll have no knowledge that that happened. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1811.3s)]
*  You'll never forget, dude. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1812.3s)]
*  You'll have dreams about it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1813.3s)]
*  Dude, I remember. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1814.3s)]
*  You're right. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1815.3s)]
*  Ray Mysterio did hit him, and it cost him days. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1816.3s)]
*  There you go. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1817.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1818.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1819.3s)]
*  So it was Mysterio. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1820.3s)]
*  Oh, he landed with the Hurricane Rana. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1821.3s)]
*  I think he landed with his butt on his face. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1822.3s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1824.82s)]
*  Ray Mysterio's super small. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1825.82s)]
*  That's not the butt face. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1826.82s)]
*  He got hit in the face by him, I think. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1827.82s)]
*  But Ray Mysterio would be hopping around like that. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1829.4199999999998s)]
*  You say he's super small. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1830.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1831.86s)]
*  That's bony butt. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1832.86s)]
*  I think he landed on his face. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1833.86s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1834.86s)]
*  I think that's the reason why he got him that way because he landed with his butt on his [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1835.86s)]
*  face. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1839.78s)]
*  The dead man. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1840.78s)]
*  The dead man. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1841.78s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1842.78s)]
*  The rope landed on Undertaker's head. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1843.78s)]
*  He mistimed a top rope senton. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1844.78s)]
*  How'd you land on Undertaker's head? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1845.78s)]
*  Yeah, he landed on his head with his butt. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1846.78s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1847.78s)]
*  Yeah, he mistimed the move and landed on his face and broke his face. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1849.26s)]
*  Imagine looking forward to that all day. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1857.22s)]
*  That guy's going to put a jump on your face with his ass. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1858.78s)]

*  You're like, fuck, dude. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1862.3s)]
*  Oh, but the other guy, fuck in your face. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1863.3s)]
*  Fuck in your face. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1865.3s)]
*  And you have to lay there like you're alcohol. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1866.3s)]
*  In front of an arena. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=1868.3s)]

*  Me and him were young and just bullying a headliner, just fully like, oh, is that what [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2222.96s)]
*  you said back in the condo? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2227.04s)]
*  He's like, yeah, that is. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2229.04s)]
*  Those weird headliners that no one knows who they are, but they can kind of headline and [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2230.92s)]
*  they go to some places and they've been doing it way too long. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2235.6s)]
*  They can achieve this very high level of toxic bitterness. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2238.96s)]
*  It's Sith. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2243.7599999999998s)]
*  They're around them and they have a couple beers and they start looking at you sideways. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2244.9s)]
*  Dude. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2247.9s)]
*  They tried it. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2248.9s)]
*  They're like, oh, dude, that was the guy. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2249.9s)]
*  He was like, oh, you guys are doing a podcast. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2250.9s)]
*  I guess we'll see, huh? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2251.9s)]
*  Don't waste your time. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2256.7000000000003s)]
*  Fucking dickhead, dude. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2257.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that was very funny. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2258.7000000000003s)]
*  He was, yeah, he was just a big guy. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2261.7000000000003s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2264.7000000000003s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2265.7000000000003s)]
*  16, 15. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2266.7000000000003s)]
*  But in his defense back then, how many podcasts were there? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2267.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2271.7000000000003s)]
*  I think people had already figured out that you could make money off of it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2273.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2277.64s)]
*  By 15, yeah. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2278.64s)]
*  There was enough. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2279.64s)]
*  He just was saying like every comedian does it. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2280.64s)]
*  Trust me, I tried it. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2283.48s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2284.48s)]
*  It's not going to work for you guys. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2285.48s)]
*  You suck. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2286.48s)]
*  I think the market's over saturated now, but I still think people should do it. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2287.48s)]
*  If I was a new comic, if you're a new comic starting out now, you should do a podcast [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2295.4399999999996s)]
*  even if no one's going to listen. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  Just keep doing it. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2303.34s)]
*  Just do it and keep doing it and it'll grow. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2304.34s)]
*  But there's so many of them now. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2306.54s)]
*  Trying to get an audience now, it's so much harder than it was five years ago. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2309.38s)]
*  Yeah, maybe six years ago. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2312.78s)]
*  I feel like if you're actively trying to get an audience, you just have to talk. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2313.78s)]
*  I talk to myself when I drive anyway. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2317.34s)]
*  I'll just talk and I'm like, damn, I should have requested. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2318.9s)]
*  It's so fucking good. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2320.54s)]
*  You talk out loud to yourself and you feel like damn, I'm good. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2321.54s)]
*  It's fire, dude. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2324.54s)]
*  While I'm driving, I talk to myself all the time. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2325.54s)]
*  My kid will be in the back seat and I'll be talking to myself and turn around and be like, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2327.46s)]
*  ha ha ha. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2331.1s)]
*  I can't stop. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2332.68s)]
*  You like that one? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2333.68s)]
*  I can't stop. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2334.68s)]
*  Casting. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2335.68s)]
*  That's your thing always, is talking to yourself? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2336.68s)]
*  Sometimes, I'll just talk. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2337.68s)]
*  I don't realize I'm doing it. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2338.68s)]
*  I'll be thinking and I'll just start talking. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2339.68s)]
*  Jesus Christ, if I recorded what I was saying in a car. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2341.68s)]
*  Classified. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2347.68s)]
*  A quick pocket. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2348.68s)]
*  I don't think I've ever talked to myself in a car. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2349.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2351.68s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2352.68s)]
*  It's good. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2353.68s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2354.68s)]
*  I'm going to try it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2355.68s)]
*  Like talking out loud? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2356.68s)]
*  Yeah, just talking to yourself. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2357.68s)]
*  It would be a good way to do a podcast. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2358.68s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2359.68s)]
*  If you had a Tesla, especially if you have a quiet car, you can set up a camera and just [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2361.2599999999998s)]
*  do a podcast while you're driving. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2365.3399999999997s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2366.98s)]
*  Bill Byrd did stuff like that, but it was more like him driving around like, God, look [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2369.18s)]
*  at this fucking guy. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2373.2999999999997s)]
*  You're giving a tour. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2374.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's giving a tour. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2375.2999999999997s)]
*  That is good. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2376.2999999999997s)]
*  You give tours of towns and shit. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2377.2999999999997s)]
*  You driving and just talking must be for real terrifying. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2378.2999999999997s)]
*  Fleshing out the ideas. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2381.98s)]
*  Well, that's the way a lot of guys come up with material. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2383.46s)]
*  That's how Dylan does it. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2388.5s)]
*  He comes up with so much material because he's podcasting all the time. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2391.0s)]
*  He's ranting about things. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2392.92s)]
*  Some of them you can keep. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2394.2000000000003s)]
*  Some of them are genuinely good ideas. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2395.2000000000003s)]
*  Two percent, I would say. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2398.08s)]
*  If you fucking sling ten around, you get pickup too. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2400.84s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2404.48s)]
*  That's pretty nice. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2405.48s)]
*  I was trying the ones we worked. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2406.48s)]
*  You and me worked, workshopped a couple of jokes this week. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2407.48s)]
*  The seller did not like them. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2410.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2412.04s)]
*  The seller wasn't that excited about it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2413.04s)]
*  Because I couldn't word it. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2415.04s)]
*  I don't know how to word it. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2416.96s)]
*  How many sets did you do down there? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2417.96s)]
*  It was like five or six a night. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2420.58s)]
*  So each set, the audience was similar? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2422.58s)]
*  I probably tried it twice and then scrapped it. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2425.46s)]
*  Me and Matt did a podcast that day and we were talking about if there was a parent sex [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2428.1s)]
*  like pride parade. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2434.02s)]
*  If you're... [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2436.54s)]
*  See, it doesn't work. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2437.54s)]
*  If your parents flaunt it, there's sexuality. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2438.54s)]
*  The way gay people do it is a pride parade. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2441.54s)]
*  If it was your dad and your mom on a float. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2443.54s)]
*  Even a gay guy would be like, ew. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2445.54s)]
*  And then I was trying to say, look, I'm happy you guys are doing it, but that's how we feel. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2450.12s)]
*  We're like, ew. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2455.12s)]
*  I'm glad you're doing it, but gross, dude. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2456.12s)]
*  And it didn't work. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2459.12s)]
*  Still didn't work. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2460.12s)]
*  I mean, it's funny. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2461.12s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2462.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2463.12s)]
*  It's a fair point. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2464.12s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2465.12s)]
*  I mean, again, do what you want to do. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2466.12s)]
*  The dog general worked. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2467.12s)]
*  Did it? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2468.12s)]
*  I might be on to something there. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2469.12s)]
*  The dog general? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2470.12s)]
*  That fucking dude that retired in the military with a dog mask. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2471.12s)]
*  I don't even know if it's real. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2474.12s)]
*  What? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2476.12s)]
*  This guy from the military retired and he was wearing a fucking leather dog mask in [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2477.2s)]
*  his uniform, like in front of the flag. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2482.98s)]
*  What? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2484.7799999999997s)]
*  It might be fake. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2485.7799999999997s)]
*  I might have got tricked, but either way. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2486.7799999999997s)]
*  They were using it on Twitter. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2487.7799999999997s)]
*  He was like, Commander Bow-Ow's retiring. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2488.7799999999997s)]
*  Arf-arf. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2491.7799999999997s)]

*  1899 prohibited use of international warfare bullets that easily expand or flatten the body. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2773.14s)]
*  What? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2778.14s)]
*  It is a common misapprehension that a hollow point ammunition is prohibited by the Geneva [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2779.14s)]
*  Convention as the prohibition significantly predates those conventions. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2783.14s)]
*  But they still do implement that though. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2787.14s)]
*  My friend who served was explaining to me the rounds that they made them use over there. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2791.8399999999997s)]
*  What? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2797.8399999999997s)]
*  They tried to outlaw fucking night vision. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2798.8399999999997s)]
*  Now I don't know if that was just his unit. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2800.8399999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2802.8399999999997s)]
*  They tried to be like, this is unfair. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2803.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you know how crazy it is, fair and unfair when it comes to killing people? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2805.8399999999997s)]
*  We're going to get weird 2015 DOD law or manual returns hollow point bullets to armed conflict. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2808.8399999999997s)]

*  He was overseas. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2818.8399999999997s)]
*  It's time for some dudes heads to fucking explode. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2820.54s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, but that was what he had said. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2822.54s)]
*  And did they have hollow point bullets in 1899 I guess? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2826.54s)]
*  Yeah, but doesn't this stuff go out the window when guys start fighting for their survival? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2829.54s)]
*  It certainly should. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2833.54s)]
*  Well, I don't want to break those rules. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2834.54s)]
*  But when you're seeing a scene like I saw with the foxhole and you know, this is what [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2836.54s)]
*  these guys are going through today and it's all done on someone's fucking Samsung Galaxy [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2840.54s)]
*  so it's like clear video. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2844.54s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2846.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's real close up to it's like, it's kind of embarrassing at this point. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2849.24s)]
*  It's like, dude, you guys are really what are we doing? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2854.24s)]
*  Is shooting each other in the face right now? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2856.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's got at this point. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2858.24s)]
*  It's kind of embarrassing. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2859.24s)]
*  It's like, come on, man. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2860.24s)]
*  Well, civilizations when they evolve with war, you never kind of get them out. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2861.24s)]
*  I think the only chance we have is if we keep like all moving to a new place with a new [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2867.24s)]
*  agreement. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2875.24s)]
*  Like the reason why United States is so much different than anywhere else is because the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2876.9399999999996s)]
*  majority of people just said, look, let's get the fuck out of here and start a new place [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2879.9399999999996s)]
*  because this shit's crazy. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2882.9399999999996s)]
*  And then everybody was like, hey, where'd you guys go? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2884.9399999999996s)]
*  And then that place, come back, place became the shit. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2886.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's really what America is. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2889.9399999999996s)]
*  But then eventually it gets fucked too. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2891.9399999999996s)]
*  Like we don't have the same like physical wars on our borders because we're luckily [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2894.9399999999996s)]
*  surrounded by water. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2899.9399999999996s)]
*  But we're still engaging in it all over the place and ramped up. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2900.9399999999996s)]
*  We're involved in so many different conflicts all over the world. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2905.64s)]
*  It's almost like the only way you're ever going to stop that is if people keep, it was [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2907.64s)]
*  like, all right, this one didn't work either. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2910.64s)]
*  Let's keep going one more time. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2912.64s)]
*  Antarctica, here we go. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2914.64s)]
*  And take over that one and then do that for a few hundred years and then fuck that up [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2915.64s)]
*  and then everyone learn. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2919.64s)]
*  It's like the lessons that people learn in civilization, they take forever. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2921.64s)]
*  They take forever. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2926.64s)]
*  We're still doing the death penalty. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2928.64s)]
*  We know how many people are innocent that are on death row. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2930.64s)]
*  We know. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2932.64s)]
*  We're killing innocent people. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2934.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, yeah, but fucking wins a win. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2935.3399999999997s)]

*  This guy was a little girl and it was DNA reversed it. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2964.04s)]
*  Maybe it was on here. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2966.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2967.04s)]
*  There's been a bunch of them. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2968.04s)]
*  We saw you with her the last time. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2969.04s)]
*  That was all it took. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2970.04s)]
*  And then they found he couldn't afford DNA testing or something. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2971.04s)]
*  Well, there's one guy who was an immigrant who walked into a trailer after this woman [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2975.04s)]
*  had murdered someone and his footprints got everywhere and they blamed him and he was [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2980.04s)]
*  in jail for 20 years. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2985.04s)]

*  Well, it's like what the fuck's going on? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2988.04s)]
*  I can imagine you check in on people and you open the door and someone's like, oh, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2990.04s)]
*  someone's been knifed to death. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=2993.74s)]

*  Yeah, so he tried to hide. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3003.74s)]
*  And then the woman blames it on him and it's just crazy. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3004.74s)]
*  It fucking sucks. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3008.74s)]
*  And it's such a flawed system. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3009.74s)]
*  And the thing is there's an incentive for a prosecutor once they're starting to try [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3012.74s)]
*  a case, they want to win that fucking case. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3016.74s)]

*  And so they're trying to win. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3020.74s)]
*  And when it's like a government prosecutor or a district attorney and they know there's [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3022.4399999999996s)]
*  some information that would exonerate that person, they're just like, you don't give [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3027.4399999999996s)]
*  a fuck. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3032.4399999999996s)]

*  Or DAs that are like, I arrested the most people. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3038.4399999999996s)]

*  And it's like, remember that? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3044.4399999999996s)]
*  I was tough on crime. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3045.4399999999996s)]

*  That sounds sus. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3094.8399999999997s)]
*  No one self-reported that fucking laptop. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3095.8399999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3098.0s)]
*  That laptop. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3099.0s)]
*  Well, that was Russian disinformation. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3100.0s)]
*  That reeks of Russian disinformation. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3101.0s)]
*  They got ahold of the social media companies and lied to them. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3102.0s)]
*  They did whatever the fuck they could to keep that from happening. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3106.98s)]
*  And even this, they discovered this before the midterms. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3109.18s)]
*  So they didn't release the information until after the midterms. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3112.58s)]
*  I mean, everyone said this a million times, but the news, if that was flip-flop, if it [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3117.9s)]
*  was Trump's kid, that would have been all over. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3122.38s)]
*  It would have been like, this is the fate of our democracy, rest in the suns, blah, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3125.46s)]
*  blah, blah. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3129.02s)]
*  And the media would have gone right along with it. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3130.02s)]
*  Yeah, and it's so obvious and it sounds trite, but it's like, dude, why do they... [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3131.96s)]
*  What's the incentive to be like, nah, fuck that guy, not that guy? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3137.56s)]
*  That kind of freaks me out. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3140.32s)]
*  Dude, there's a bunch of us that are just unrepresented. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3141.32s)]
*  It's the reasonable middle. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3144.08s)]
*  The reasonable middle of the world. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3145.92s)]
*  Unrepresented. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3148.28s)]
*  You've got radical left and radical right. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3149.44s)]
*  You got people that are all in on the Republican Party and you should never get an abortion, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3152.32s)]
*  even if you've been raped. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3156.6s)]
*  You got wild shit on that side and on the other side you got Men Can Get Pregnant. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3158.16s)]

*  He was just making mistakes. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3167.66s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3170.14s)]
*  We should barely even attack him. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3171.7s)]
*  We don't even need to bring him in. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3174.04s)]
*  Come on, guys. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3175.5s)]
*  Why would they let that guy off the hook? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3177.5s)]
*  He's the number two donor to the Democratic Party. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3179.7s)]
*  Number two. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3182.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, like... [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3183.8999999999996s)]
*  Just by George Soros. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3184.8999999999996s)]
*  And they're like, whatever, whatever. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3185.8999999999996s)]
*  No one's freaking out. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3187.08s)]
*  My favorite is the Republicans hanging onto that Santos dude. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3188.08s)]
*  That is wild. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3193.12s)]
*  The Republicans are like, no, he's a good dude. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3194.12s)]
*  That guy should be in jail. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3195.12s)]
*  Santos is the guy who's like, I'm Jewish. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3196.12s)]
*  And they're like, you're not Jewish. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3199.12s)]
*  And he's like, I meant Jew-ish. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3200.12s)]
*  I'm like a Jew. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3201.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a master of the English language. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3202.7999999999997s)]
*  He's a master of the English language. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3205.7999999999997s)]
*  He lied about so many things. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3206.7999999999997s)]
*  I found out about it on the podcast and then I went on a deep dive. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3208.24s)]
*  I'm like, this guy's wild. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3211.36s)]
*  I was looking at him yesterday. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3213.48s)]
*  The first article that came up was like, he lied about being a volleyball star. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3214.64s)]
*  That's the funniest. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3217.88s)]
*  Well, you ever see Biden lie about his education? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3218.88s)]
*  Have you ever seen that clip? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3222.48s)]
*  Where he lied about his education and they fact-checked him on the news? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3224.04s)]
*  What did he say he was? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3228.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3229.0s)]
*  He just flat out lied about his credentials. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3230.0s)]
*  I think it fucked him up in that debate. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3233.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3235.24s)]
*  He was running a while ago and he got fucked up on... [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3236.72s)]
*  Well, he ran for president in 88. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3238.68s)]
*  He plagiarized the speech. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3239.68s)]
*  He did that. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3240.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3241.68s)]
*  I remember when we did Joe Biden night at Stitch's Comedy Club in Boston where we'd [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3242.74s)]
*  all do each other's acts. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3245.62s)]
*  That time Joe Biden lied about his academic credentials. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3247.54s)]
*  So watch this video because it's fucking crazy. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3250.2999999999997s)]
*  He was 76 of 85. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3252.2999999999997s)]
*  He was so silly. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3253.2999999999997s)]
*  He might have gotten it wrong though. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3254.2999999999997s)]
*  He might have been like 85 for top. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3255.2999999999997s)]
*  Truthfully, a guy who finishes 76 would get it wrong. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3256.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's the video. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3257.2999999999997s)]
*  This just says it's the road to the White House. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3258.2999999999997s)]
*  No, this is the video. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3263.2999999999997s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3264.2999999999997s)]
*  There it is. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3265.2999999999997s)]
*  He argues with this guy. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3266.2999999999997s)]
*  And the other question is, could you quickly... [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3267.2999999999997s)]
*  I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3270.92s)]
*  Oh, beast. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3273.92s)]
*  I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class to have a full academic [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3274.92s)]
*  scholarship. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3281.0s)]
*  In the first year in law school, I decided I didn't want to be in law school and ended [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3282.0s)]
*  up in the bottom two-thirds of my class and then decided I wanted to stay, went back to [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3285.3s)]
*  law school and in fact ended up in the top half of my class. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3289.6800000000003s)]
*  I won the International Moot Court Competition. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3293.1600000000003s)]
*  I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3295.6000000000004s)]
*  I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3299.42s)]
*  Only need 123 credits and I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3303.54s)]
*  you'd like, Frank. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3307.94s)]
*  You rewind that and look at the guy who wants to fuck him so bad. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3308.94s)]
*  See how happy that guy was? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3312.94s)]
*  He was like, you're doing it, Joe. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3314.94s)]
*  I'm not questioning your IQ. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3316.94s)]
*  I'm just saying that with the people that we have elected to office in recent years, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3318.94s)]
*  I think that we have to question their credentials very solidly. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3322.94s)]
*  Well, I think you're right, Frank. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3325.94s)]
*  Damn. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3328.52s)]
*  But you know what I find kind of interesting? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3329.52s)]
*  It seems to me if you can speak, you're at a liability in the Democratic Party anymore. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3331.76s)]
*  It seems to me you've all become heartless technocrats. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3335.56s)]
*  It seems to me that you forget that what happens is we've never as a party... [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3338.86s)]
*  Okay, pause this. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3342.76s)]
*  This is now nonsense. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3343.76s)]
*  Biden rules. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3344.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3345.76s)]
*  It's pretty nasty, dude. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3346.76s)]
*  Go to the article where it says what his actual stats were. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3347.76s)]
*  Because someone fact-checked him on the news. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3351.2000000000003s)]

*  There's one that they played that clip on the news and then fact-checked it. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3353.7200000000003s)]

*  nonsense as far as... [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3361.42s)]
*  He was actually 70th in a class of 85. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3362.42s)]
*  So he wasn't in the top half. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3366.26s)]
*  But there was a bunch of other stuff that he lied about in that clip, too. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3368.0600000000004s)]
*  In the news clip where they check it, this hardcore news guy goes, actually, the true [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3370.98s)]
*  story is... [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3376.86s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3383.14s)]
*  The new questions stem from tape remarks of Biden during an April campaign appearance [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3384.14s)]

*  I went to law school on a full academic scholarship. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3389.48s)]
*  Yeah, scoot ahead a little to the... [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3392.64s)]
*  You can't... [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3395.04s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3396.04s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3397.04s)]
*  Keep playing. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3398.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3399.04s)]
*  In my class, I'd have a full academic scholarship. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3400.04s)]
*  Went back to law school and, in fact, ended up in the top half of my class. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3401.44s)]
*  I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3405.92s)]
*  I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3409.72s)]
*  Only 123 credits. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3413.54s)]
*  Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3415.14s)]
*  he does not have three degrees from college, and that he was not named outstanding political [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3419.62s)]
*  science student in college. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3423.7s)]
*  Newsweek says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship, ended up near the bottom [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3425.58s)]
*  of his class, and won only one degree, not three. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3429.62s)]
*  Joe Biden ranked 76th in the class of 85 at the University of Syracuse Law School. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3433.06s)]
*  I mean, this guy comes off this whole thing as a flyweight. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3438.4s)]
*  Now Biden says, Newsweek is right, his memory had failed him. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3441.56s)]
*  His memory had failed him. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3444.56s)]
*  My memory had failed me. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3446.56s)]
*  But his memory seems so good right there. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3448.56s)]
*  True. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3450.56s)]
*  That would be so scary if you could rattle off facts. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3451.56s)]
*  Maybe those are early signs of dementia. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3453.56s)]
*  You could rattle off facts. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3455.56s)]
*  You think are facts. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3457.56s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3458.56s)]
*  Maybe he believed it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3459.56s)]
*  Maybe he believed it. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3460.56s)]
*  My memory failed me. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3461.56s)]
*  Maybe his memory fails him all the time. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3462.56s)]
*  Maybe he's just like hanging on. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3464.56s)]
*  He just has a prepared speech for if Bob asks this, I say that. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3466.56s)]
*  He has to write it all out. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3469.56s)]
*  I want to ram it down his fucking throat. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3470.56s)]
*  The guy's like, I think you're in it. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3472.56s)]
*  He's like, actually I got the highest IQ on earth, motherfucker. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3473.56s)]
*  That does hurt when the dorks come after you though. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3476.56s)]
*  You know, they're lying. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3479.56s)]
*  Can you imagine if they did that? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3480.56s)]
*  Those are the mainstream dorks. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3481.56s)]
*  I mean, that was Sam Donald. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3483.56s)]
*  That was back in the day. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3484.56s)]
*  The real dorks. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3485.56s)]
*  The real dorks. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3486.56s)]
*  The heavyweight dorks got them. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3487.56s)]
*  The journalists. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3488.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3489.56s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3490.56s)]
*  I exaggerate when I'm angry, but I've never gone around telling people things that aren't [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3491.56s)]
*  true about me. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3494.56s)]
*  An oxymoron. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3496.06s)]
*  You just lied right there. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3497.06s)]
*  I lied, but I never lie. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3498.06s)]
*  He just lied right there. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3500.06s)]
*  Because he lied. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3501.06s)]
*  He said he had three degrees. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3502.06s)]
*  That's not an exaggeration. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3503.06s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3504.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3505.06s)]
*  You know, saying you're in the top half of your class is also a lie. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3507.06s)]
*  It's exaggerating. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3510.06s)]
*  If you say I fucking killed it in college, but then they find out you were in the bottom [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3511.06s)]
*  half of the class, well that's an exaggeration. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3515.06s)]
*  Well, that's kind of a lie too. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3517.06s)]
*  He can be like, I was in a lot of clubs. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3518.06s)]
*  I played intramural sports. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3520.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3522.06s)]
*  But he fucked it up. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3523.06s)]
*  He went for it. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3524.06s)]
*  And he called black people super predators. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3525.56s)]
*  No, that was Hill Dog. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3526.56s)]
*  Did he say that? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3529.56s)]
*  I think it was Hillary. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3530.56s)]
*  I think it was him. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3531.56s)]
*  He called them super predators too. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3532.56s)]
*  I think there's him on tape. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3533.56s)]
*  I think he's been on tape. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3534.56s)]
*  He said some rough ones. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3535.56s)]
*  He had some rough ones. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3536.56s)]
*  I think they get these terms that they'd like to throw around and then they start using [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3537.56s)]
*  them with each other and it's like sort of a signal that we're all on the same page. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3540.2s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3543.56s)]
*  You know, whatever it is, whatever term they're using to try to push things across. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3544.56s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, not Joe Biden, use the term super predator. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3548.16s)]
*  Damn son. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3551.06s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3552.06s)]
*  Jamie? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3553.06s)]
*  This makes up for the lack of dog general info. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3554.06s)]
*  Joe Biden, let's go. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3556.56s)]
*  Yeah, Hillary boy. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3560.56s)]
*  I know women want a female president. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3562.56s)]
*  You got one in Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3565.56s)]
*  Go get her. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3566.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3567.56s)]
*  That's one that you could really get behind. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3568.56s)]
*  Who do you like, Matt? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3570.06s)]
*  In terms of- [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3571.56s)]
*  Who are you trying to endorse? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3572.56s)]
*  I want Yang, dude. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3573.56s)]
*  Yang's a beast. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3574.56s)]
*  I just want a new party. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3575.56s)]
*  I don't care what he does. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3576.56s)]
*  I just want a new party to win. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3577.56s)]
*  Be fun. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3579.56s)]
*  Just like knock the other guy out. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3580.56s)]
*  You were Yang Yang early. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3582.56s)]
*  Yeah, I like the idea of just- [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3583.56s)]
*  You liked UBI at first. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3584.56s)]
*  You liked Universal Basic [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3586.06s)]
*  What, you a communist? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3587.56s)]
*  No, I thought it was a cool idea. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3588.06s)]
*  Try it. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3589.06s)]
*  I think we should do wild experiments. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3590.06s)]
*  Just try it out. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3592.06s)]
*  I thought it was a cool idea until people started getting money during the pandemic [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3593.06s)]
*  and they didn't want to go back to work. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3596.06s)]
*  And I was like, oh no, this is what happens. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3597.06s)]
*  Then you try to go to Starbucks at a rest stop. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3599.06s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have a collapse of the service industry. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3601.06s)]
*  One person. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3603.06s)]
*  You'd collapse of jobs that suck. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3604.06s)]
*  But you would also have a resurgence of people doing what they actually want to do. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3606.06s)]
*  It wouldn't be everybody, but it would give a good chunk of people an opportunity to try something that they've always wanted to do [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3610.56s)]
*  where they don't have to worry about subsistence. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3617.56s)]
*  They don't have to worry about food and rent. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3619.56s)]
*  And then they can go pursue a dream. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3621.56s)]
*  But how many are going to do that? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3623.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3625.56s)]
*  Is it worth trying? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3626.56s)]
*  It might be. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3627.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3628.56s)]
*  But human nature. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3629.56s)]
*  The problem with human nature, if you give them stuff and make them so they don't have to do anything, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3630.56s)]
*  they don't do things. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3635.56s)]
*  That's a lot of people. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3636.56s)]
*  But a lot of people wouldn't. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3637.56s)]
*  It's an opportunity. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3639.56s)]
*  It's almost like you need to educate people what gives you meaning in life. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3640.56s)]
*  And I know being lazy is very attractive. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3644.56s)]
*  It draws you to it. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3647.56s)]
*  It's so comfortable to just sit on the couch and play video games and do nothing. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3649.56s)]
*  But you're going to get depressed. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3653.56s)]
*  You're going to get depressed. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3655.56s)]
*  You need a task. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3657.56s)]
*  I think everybody needs a different task. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3660.56s)]
*  And everybody has a different level of need. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3662.56s)]
*  But you need tasks. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3664.56s)]
*  This is emotion. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3666.56s)]
*  Have you played Bannerlord? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3667.56s)]
*  Dude, if I played games, man, I'd have a fucking problem. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3670.56s)]
*  Jamie can tell you, I have a problem. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3673.56s)]
*  I get psychotically obsessed. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3676.56s)]
*  And I would play 8, 10 hours a day. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3678.56s)]
*  And it'll fuck up my life. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3680.56s)]
*  And I'll look pale like a vampire. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3682.56s)]
*  What the fuck's wrong with that? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3684.56s)]
*  Dude, I was playing Quake. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3686.56s)]
*  I would play all night long, man. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3688.56s)]
*  I installed a T1 line in my house. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3690.56s)]
*  Back when I couldn't get a good internet, because I was living in the mountains, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3693.56s)]
*  I was like, what can you do? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3698.56s)]
*  And they go, well, if you had a business, we could run a T1 line. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3700.56s)]
*  I go, well, I got a business. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3702.56s)]
*  Let's run a T1 line. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3704.56s)]
*  They had to fucking dig up the street, and lay pipes and shit. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3706.56s)]
*  Oh, they had to send like the boring missiles in. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3709.56s)]
*  I went hard. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3711.56s)]
*  So I could play Quake. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3713.56s)]
*  How long did this last for? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3715.56s)]
*  Oh, I had to quit Cold Turkey. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3717.56s)]
*  I realized it was a real problem. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3719.56s)]
*  I played that way. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3721.56s)]
*  I plugged in the Xbox 360 this week and started playing NCAA 14. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3723.56s)]
*  It took eight hours. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3727.56s)]
*  There was my friend Rob as a manager at the Comedy Store, real nice guy. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3729.56s)]
*  And one day he said, you know, he played EverQuest all day. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3732.56s)]
*  He had a real problem. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3736.56s)]
*  And he goes, I'm so good at making money in EverQuest and so bad at it in the real world. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3738.56s)]
*  And I was like, this is profound. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3743.56s)]
*  Because he was having this, you know, he's out in public. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3745.56s)]
*  He left the house. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3748.56s)]
*  He had no idea to shut the computer off and leave the house. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3750.56s)]
*  He's like so immersed in the game. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3752.56s)]
*  So he's hanging out with us at the store in the back bar. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3754.56s)]
*  And he's like, I got to do something, man. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3756.56s)]
*  I got to do something. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3758.56s)]
*  I'm like, you got to quit. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3760.56s)]
*  Like, it'll get, they're fucking great. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3762.56s)]
*  I love them. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3764.56s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, I'm not an anti-video game person. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3766.56s)]
*  I fucking love them. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3768.56s)]
*  But I know for me, they're too fun. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3770.56s)]
*  I get, I was like, why am I just sitting around answering emails that I have to answer? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3772.56s)]
*  Why can't I just be in a world of murder? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3776.56s)]
*  I got to be honest. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3778.56s)]
*  I got to be honest. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3780.56s)]
*  That's exactly where I'm at. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3782.56s)]
*  Dude, I get emails and I go, fuck out of here. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3784.56s)]
*  I literally put the phone down. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3786.56s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3788.56s)]
*  Mountain Blade Bannerlord, dude. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3790.56s)]
*  Times suck. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3792.56s)]
*  I get addicted. I can't do it. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3794.56s)]
*  And I suck too. I suck at them. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3796.56s)]
*  The UFC is my favorite. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3798.56s)]
*  We lived together and I was like, I'm going to get good and beat Shane. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3800.56s)]
*  And I played all day. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3802.56s)]
*  He was at work, I was at home. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3804.56s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to kick his ass. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3806.56s)]
*  I'm going to kick his ass. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3808.56s)]
*  And he came home and was like, what's this? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3810.56s)]
*  I beat my ass and I stormed up. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3812.56s)]
*  I get so mad too. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3814.56s)]
*  I can't handle it. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3816.56s)]
*  I play that karate game. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3818.56s)]
*  Is it Dead or Alive? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3820.56s)]
*  It's a fucking great karate game. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3822.56s)]
*  You get to pick all these different, and my daughter kept jacking me up. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3824.56s)]
*  She was using this little lady. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3826.56s)]
*  And this little lady does this little fast move. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3828.56s)]
*  She spins around and kicks you in the head. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3830.56s)]
*  Yikes! [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3832.56s)]
*  Yikes! [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3834.56s)]
*  We'll do a different move. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3836.56s)]
*  My daughter kept fucking me up. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3838.56s)]
*  She was so happy and I was so upset with myself. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3840.56s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3842.56s)]
*  That was that girl. She's hot as fuck. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3844.56s)]
*  Dead or Alive. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3846.56s)]
*  It's a fucking great game. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3848.56s)]
*  It's so addictive. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3850.56s)]
*  And you can use some martial arts strategy in that game. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3852.56s)]
*  If you know good techniques. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3856.56s)]
*  I'm the only one that can do ground and pound in the UFC. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3858.56s)]
*  I'm the only one that can do jiu jitsu in the UFC. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3860.56s)]
*  I can do jiu jitsu in the UFC in our video games. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3862.56s)]
*  So you know how to hit arm bars and stuff? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3864.56s)]
*  I can crush them. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3866.56s)]
*  How do you learn? Do you learn by pressing certain buttons at the same time? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3868.56s)]
*  Timing, stamina, all that. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3870.56s)]
*  It's very fun. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3872.56s)]
*  Doing the voice over for that was one of the most brutal jobs I've ever had. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3874.56s)]
*  It's so long. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3878.56s)]
*  Because you have these lists of all these things that can possibly happen. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3880.56s)]
*  And all these fighters' names. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3884.56s)]
*  And all these different scenarios. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3886.56s)]
*  How long does it take? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3888.56s)]
*  Hours and hours and hours. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3890.56s)]
*  Many many many many days. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3892.56s)]
*  Yeah, you're working. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3894.56s)]
*  You're in a fucking sound booth. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3896.56s)]
*  And you're constantly drinking water because I'm screaming. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3898.56s)]
*  So I can only do it because... [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3900.56s)]
*  You know, it's like, oh! [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3902.56s)]
*  You're doing shit like that. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3904.56s)]
*  I'm trying to do it like a real fight. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3906.56s)]
*  You weren't in the last one. It fucked me up. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3908.56s)]
*  I genuinely was like, damn dude, I need the fucking... [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3910.56s)]
*  Daddy's busy. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3912.56s)]
*  Daddy's busy. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3914.56s)]
*  It's too much work. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3916.56s)]
*  It's so much work. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3918.56s)]
*  I was in the one before it but they used my old stuff. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3920.56s)]
*  So I only did like two of them. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3922.56s)]
*  And I was like, that's it! I can't do it anymore. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3924.56s)]
*  Can't you just relicense the sounds? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3926.56s)]
*  I just take the other ones. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3928.56s)]
*  Oh, I gotta use the new guys. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3930.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's new names, new people. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3932.56s)]
*  That means new sessions and this fucking thing. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3934.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's not coal mining. I get it. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3936.56s)]
*  I mean, guess what? I'm busy. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3938.56s)]
*  Yeah, but you get it in your head. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3940.56s)]
*  If you're just trying to say things right, it'll kind of spin you out. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3942.56s)]
*  Well, it's also a huge strain on your voice. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3946.56s)]
*  Because the way you're talking during the UFC fight, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3948.56s)]
*  it's like you're pushing your vocal cords. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3950.56s)]
*  Wow, that was wild, by the way. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3954.56s)]
*  That was actually weird. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3956.56s)]
*  That was a gear. You shift the gears. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3958.56s)]
*  That was a Tesla. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3960.56s)]
*  How wild is that car? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3962.56s)]
*  It's scary. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3964.56s)]
*  I took them on the ride in a Model S Plaid. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3966.56s)]
*  Yeah, it seems so normal, right? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3968.56s)]
*  Well, until I noticed your fucking steering wheel. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3970.56s)]
*  Halfway through the ride, you're like, this thing's cool, right? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3972.56s)]
*  Have you ever been in one? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3974.56s)]
*  I was like, I think I've been in a Tesla. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3976.56s)]

*  Also, the horn's not in the center. The horn's a button. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3988.56s)]
*  I don't like that. Everything else I love. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3990.56s)]
*  It doesn't have a blinker stalk. Go to the blinker stalk. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3992.56s)]

*  It's hidden behind the wheel. Just do that, do that. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=3998.56s)]
*  Everybody does it. It's normal. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4000.56s)]
*  It's a way to hit your blinkers. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4002.56s)]
*  Instead, they have buttons. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4004.56s)]
*  People want to get crafty. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4006.56s)]
*  Everything is minimalist. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4008.56s)]
*  Everything is done inside the panel. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4010.56s)]
*  The problem with that is the panel dies, then you're fucked. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4012.56s)]
*  You can't even roll your windows down. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4014.56s)]

*  You can't adjust the temperature. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4018.56s)]
*  They just turn off if it has an electrical shortage and you're flying. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4020.56s)]
*  It's never happened. I've never had a problem. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4024.56s)]

*  Those cars are flawless. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4030.56s)]
*  They're so well engineered. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4032.56s)]
*  They just fucking do what they're supposed to do. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4034.56s)]
*  They suck in the cold, though. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4036.56s)]
*  A lot of these people that got them in these freezing temperatures in fucking Toronto and shit, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4038.56s)]
*  it drains that fucking battery in the cold. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4042.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4044.56s)]
*  Yeah, you got to think about that. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4046.56s)]
*  But for regular driving, they make regular cars look stupid. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4048.56s)]

*  And I'd always get stuck at the top. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4258.56s)]
*  And I stalled out like three or four times. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4260.56s)]
*  Because you're like this. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4262.56s)]
*  It's like crazy peach. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4264.56s)]
*  So I had to learn how to hit the emergency brake [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4266.56s)]
*  and slowly let out the clutch [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4268.56s)]
*  while I let the emergency brake up. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4270.56s)]
*  That's how bad the hill is. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4272.56s)]
*  That's how I did mine every time. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4274.56s)]
*  I had like a... [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4276.56s)]
*  What was it? A Ford Contour. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4278.56s)]
*  I bought it stick shift off some Polish dude. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4280.56s)]
*  It's like a real handbrake. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4282.56s)]
*  If you have a stick. You can't do these bullshit [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4284.56s)]
*  fucking electronic brakes. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4286.56s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4288.56s)]
*  Electronic? What are we doing? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4290.56s)]
*  Everything's electronic. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4292.56s)]
*  At least some cars like this, like Fords, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4294.56s)]
*  are making these cars that we just... [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4296.56s)]
*  That's like an advanced muscle car. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4298.56s)]
*  You get a feel. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4300.56s)]
*  You get a... [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4302.56s)]
*  That's the fun! [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4304.56s)]
*  That's the fun! [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4306.56s)]
*  I get scared. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4308.56s)]
*  I literally... I had two percent of me [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4310.56s)]
*  like I might die right now. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4312.56s)]
*  Bro, I closed my eyes. I just wanted to tell you guys. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4314.56s)]
*  For a second I closed my eyes and then I realized [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4316.56s)]
*  how fucking insane that was. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4318.56s)]
*  I just... I asked? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4320.56s)]
*  No, it was... [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4322.56s)]
*  It was genuinely impressive to move that fast. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4324.56s)]
*  My body was just like... [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4326.56s)]
*  I freaked out. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4328.56s)]
*  I wanted you to give me permission. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4330.56s)]
*  You got consent. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4332.56s)]
*  I wouldn't be that guy. You didn't want me to? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4334.56s)]
*  No, we didn't. I wouldn't mind, you know. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4336.56s)]
*  It was bizarre, right? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4338.56s)]
*  It was very bizarre. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4340.56s)]
*  Because this is a four-door sedan. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4342.56s)]
*  It looks like a normal car. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4344.56s)]
*  I almost clutched your torso from behind. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4346.56s)]
*  I was fucking held on. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4348.56s)]
*  And then he's going to have that little one [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4350.56s)]
*  that's even faster than that. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4352.56s)]
*  Jamie, do not let that happen again. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4354.56s)]
*  Jamie, do not let that happen again. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4356.56s)]
*  Take it to a commercial break. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4358.56s)]
*  These autoplay motherfuckers. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4360.56s)]
*  I was looking at new muscle cars. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4362.56s)]
*  It's a new challenger. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4364.56s)]
*  Is this one? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4366.56s)]
*  That's the electric one. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4368.56s)]
*  Look, you don't see exhaust pipes. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4370.56s)]
*  Oh, that sucks. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4372.56s)]
*  It's electric and it makes fake noises. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4374.56s)]
*  It makes like, rawr, rawr. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4376.56s)]
*  That's kind of funny. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4378.56s)]
*  It actually does that though? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4380.56s)]
*  Like audible outside of the car? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4382.56s)]
*  Yeah, listen to this stupid shit. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4384.56s)]
*  It's the dumbest idea of all time. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4386.56s)]
*  This is just literally so you can bother people? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4388.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4390.56s)]
*  It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4392.56s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4394.56s)]
*  Listen to this. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4398.56s)]
*  That sound is all fake. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4400.56s)]
*  Is it speakers? I guess? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4402.56s)]
*  Yes, that should be illegal. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4404.56s)]
*  That should be illegal. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4406.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4408.56s)]
*  That's the fake butt of the car world. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4410.56s)]
*  That's what it sounds like when you rev it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4412.56s)]
*  Rawr. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4414.56s)]
*  Listen, it's got this low rumble to it. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4416.56s)]
*  Low rumble is kind of ominous. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4418.56s)]
*  The only good thing about the rumble is [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4420.56s)]
*  it's good for people walking on the streets and shit. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4422.56s)]
*  You hear the car. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4424.56s)]
*  Or protesting. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4426.56s)]
*  That's so dumb. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4428.56s)]
*  That's so dumb it hurts my feelings. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4430.56s)]
*  That idea of making a rough, fake rumble. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4432.56s)]
*  They've got to make some noise. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4434.56s)]
*  You can't have that. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4436.56s)]
*  You can't have that thing on there. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4438.56s)]
*  They will not replace us, Riley. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4440.56s)]
*  Just silent. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4442.56s)]
*  That's not great. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4444.56s)]
*  You might have to edit that one out. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4446.56s)]
*  You can't give them stealth. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4448.56s)]
*  That's a fair point. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4450.56s)]
*  Stealth is a nightmare for those people. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4452.56s)]
*  You know what the problem with that sound thing is? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4454.56s)]
*  It seems like you could hack that and have it play whatever you want. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4456.56s)]
*  Definitely. Have you been to Jamaica? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4458.56s)]
*  No. Wild. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4460.56s)]
*  What do they do? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4462.56s)]
*  They have speakers on every car. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4464.56s)]
*  Outside? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4466.56s)]
*  Plastic music, dude. Constantly. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4468.56s)]
*  That's what people are going to do with that thing. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4470.56s)]
*  When Jamaicans get a hold of this, talk. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4472.56s)]
*  The Tesla, you could make fart, right? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4474.56s)]
*  Yes, inside the car. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4476.56s)]
*  They did too. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4478.56s)]
*  I think they had to cancel that because people were fucking up. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4480.56s)]
*  That's actually very funny. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4482.56s)]
*  Do you remember that movie? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4484.56s)]
*  Was it Scanner Darkly? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4486.56s)]
*  No. What was the movie with Alex Jones where they animated him? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4488.56s)]
*  Back before Alex Jones was Persona Non Grata, he was in this mainstream animated movie. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4490.56s)]
*  That sounds like Scanner Darkly. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4496.56s)]
*  Was it Scanner Darkly? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4498.56s)]
*  He's in Waking Life. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4500.56s)]
*  Waking Life. That's right. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4502.56s)]
*  Play the clip of him from Waking Life. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4504.56s)]
*  You see him driving around in a car with a speaker on the roof. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4506.56s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4508.56s)]
*  I'm concerned with the structure. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4536.56s)]
*  I'm concerned with the systems of control. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4538.56s)]
*  Those that control my life and those that seek to control it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4540.56s)]
*  Even more! [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4542.56s)]
*  I want freedom! [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4544.56s)]
*  That's what I want! [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4546.56s)]
*  And that's what you should want! [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4548.56s)]
*  That's what I do when I drive. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4550.56s)]
*  What movie was this movie? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4552.56s)]
*  With your daughter in the back. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4554.56s)]
*  2001. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4556.56s)]
*  Richard Linklater. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4558.56s)]
*  In the wild. He's kind of killing it right there. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4560.56s)]
*  Yeah, that was actually pretty good. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4562.56s)]
*  One giant blunder. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4564.56s)]
*  It's a big blunder. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4566.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'll get you. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4568.56s)]
*  Kind of the worst blunder almost. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4570.56s)]
*  The worst blunder you can make. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4572.56s)]
*  It's the worst. It involves every bad thing. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4574.56s)]
*  Guns, kids, lies. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4576.56s)]
*  But didn't he take it back before they got him? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4578.56s)]
*  He did, but the problem is [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4580.56s)]
*  those people sued him [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4582.56s)]
*  and won $965 million. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4584.56s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4586.56s)]
*  And in Connecticut, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4588.56s)]
*  they won a large settlement in Texas, [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4590.56s)]
*  but in Texas, it's capped. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4592.56s)]
*  So I think it's capped at $700-something thousand dollars. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4594.56s)]
*  So even though it might have been $40 million, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4596.56s)]
*  really he has to pay $750,000 per once. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4598.56s)]
*  It was like $1.5 million or something. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4600.56s)]
*  But then the Connecticut one's not capped. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4602.56s)]
*  The Connecticut one's different. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4604.56s)]
*  Yeah, isn't it like a billion dollars? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4606.56s)]
*  It's close to a billion dollars. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4608.56s)]
*  That's a pretty funny way to end a trial. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4610.56s)]
*  You got a payment plan? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4612.56s)]
*  Who's the judge, fucking Dr. Evil? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4614.56s)]
*  How can you ever [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4616.56s)]
*  pay a billion dollars? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4618.56s)]
*  How can you ever [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4620.56s)]
*  come up with that number? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4622.56s)]
*  That number's so crazy. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4624.56s)]
*  The number only exists if you're trying to just put someone out of business. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4626.56s)]
*  Like completely and forever. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4628.56s)]
*  I mean, he's still going, isn't he? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4630.56s)]
*  He's not going to be able to make a fucking billion, dude. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4632.56s)]
*  This is impossible. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4634.56s)]
*  But the other question is [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4636.56s)]
*  if it goes back to trial, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4638.56s)]
*  do they reduce them? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4640.56s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4642.56s)]
*  Are you allowed to appeal? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4644.56s)]
*  I would imagine you're getting an appeal. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4646.56s)]
*  I would imagine you're getting an appeal. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4648.56s)]
*  I mean, it's probably pretty, I don't know, who knows? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4650.56s)]
*  This could go on forever and just bleed him financially. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4652.56s)]
*  He should get a pirate ship. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4654.56s)]
*  He should go out to the seas. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4656.56s)]
*  And broadcast from the seas. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4658.56s)]
*  He should save up enough money to buy a boat. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4660.56s)]
*  He should buy Epstein's Island. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4662.56s)]
*  What's going on with it? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4664.56s)]
*  Nobody wants it? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4666.56s)]
*  Do you want it? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4668.56s)]
*  What are you trying to say? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4670.56s)]
*  Open up a sandals. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4672.56s)]
*  It's a waste of a good island. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4674.56s)]
*  I'm a fucking hot ghost. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4676.56s)]
*  Russian. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4678.56s)]
*  The best ghost of all time. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4680.56s)]
*  You'd be chasing them like, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4682.56s)]
*  Come back, haunt me. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4684.56s)]
*  I'm lonely. I'm over here watching Avatar by myself. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4686.56s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4690.56s)]
*  Bespoke. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4692.56s)]
*  It's $55 million. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4694.56s)]
*  Scroll back up so I can get an overhead again. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4696.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4698.56s)]
*  There's the temple. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4700.56s)]
*  Can you imagine if I open up a podcast studio where Epstein's Island used to be? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4702.56s)]
*  Just imagine. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4704.56s)]
*  So where do they fly them in? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4706.56s)]
*  They fly them in somewhere else and then they have to yacht it out there? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4708.56s)]
*  Whatever it's called. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4710.56s)]
*  The big St. James has an airstrip on it. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4712.56s)]
*  And then they take a boat over. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4714.56s)]
*  So he's got to go to two islands actually. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4716.56s)]
*  What's stopping you from doing this? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4718.56s)]
*  Did you see the glass onion? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4720.56s)]
*  Did you see that, Jamie? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4722.56s)]
*  The Netflix, the new knives out. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4724.56s)]
*  It's fun. It's good. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4726.56s)]
*  But the dude is kind of like an Elon Musk character. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4728.56s)]
*  And he owns an island just like this. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4730.56s)]
*  You fly into St. Thomas and take a private helicopter. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4732.56s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4734.56s)]
*  Nobody wants that island. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4736.56s)]
*  Do you know how many recording pieces of equipment you have to tear down? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4738.56s)]
*  Every wall. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4740.56s)]
*  Every wall is bugged. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4742.56s)]
*  Every fucking picture. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4744.56s)]
*  The eyes are filming you. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4746.56s)]
*  I imagine you want to demolish everything anyways. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4748.56s)]
*  So you have to land on that one little island that's a landing strip. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4750.56s)]
*  That's a helipad it says. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4752.56s)]
*  Is that a landing strip too? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4754.56s)]
*  I thought this one did but it said you land on St. Thomas. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4756.56s)]
*  So that might be why it's standing back here. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4758.56s)]
*  Did they bulldoze the temple? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4760.56s)]
*  No, that's not his island. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4762.56s)]
*  That's not the same island. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4764.56s)]
*  That's the island where you can land. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4766.56s)]
*  That's close by. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4768.56s)]
*  That's his island? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4770.56s)]
*  Oh, so he has a helipad. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4772.56s)]
*  Correct. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4774.56s)]
*  I was confused. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4776.56s)]
*  I thought they were saying this is the place where you can land. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4778.56s)]
*  I'm like, why the fuck are you going to land on this little rock? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4780.56s)]
*  You think someone would demolish the temple. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4782.56s)]
*  You should put your podcast studio in the temple, dude. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4784.56s)]
*  Well, why would they demolish anything? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4786.56s)]
*  If it's valuable, somebody might want it as is. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4788.56s)]
*  There's a lot of nutty fucking people in the world. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4790.56s)]
*  If you're some Saudi billionaire and you're drinking whiskey, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4792.56s)]
*  and you're like, you know what I'm going to do? [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4794.56s)]
*  I'm going to buy that fucking island. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4796.56s)]
*  Just like they bought the WWE. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4798.56s)]
*  I'm going to buy that fucking island. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4800.56s)]
*  I'm going to stick it in Clinton's face. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4802.56s)]
*  Look where I am. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4804.56s)]
*  Do you recognize this room? [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4806.56s)]
*  You should. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4808.56s)]
*  Yeah, I know what you're doing there. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4810.56s)]
*  I'm trembling. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4812.56s)]
*  I'm like, what are you doing there? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4814.56s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to put this shit in there. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4816.56s)]
*  Trump only hung out with the staff. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4818.56s)]
*  I only went there 26 times. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4820.56s)]
*  26 is a lot. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4822.56s)]
*  26 is not a lot of times. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4824.56s)]
*  That's incriminating. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4826.56s)]
*  There's so many days in the year. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4828.56s)]
*  No one talks about that anymore. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4830.56s)]
*  It's only 26 times. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4832.56s)]
*  You got good Clinton. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4834.56s)]
*  It's not bad. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4836.56s)]
*  I got to listen to him. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4838.56s)]
*  If I listen to him, I can get it pretty good. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4840.56s)]
*  What's he up to now? [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4842.56s)]
*  He's not just old. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4844.56s)]
*  He had heart problems. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4846.56s)]
*  Then he got on a vegan diet. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4848.56s)]
*  The vegan diet is like, you got to do that. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4850.56s)]
*  You got to be real good with that. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4852.56s)]
*  If you want to do that and be healthy, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4854.56s)]
*  you have to really dot your eyes [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4856.56s)]
*  and cross your T's and make sure [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4858.56s)]
*  you get all your macronutrients and shit. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4860.56s)]
*  You got to take supplements. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4862.56s)]
*  He just looks like this. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4864.56s)]
*  You're in ketosis, man. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4866.56s)]
*  I was. I had a week. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4868.56s)]
*  I started getting restless legs from my whole body. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4870.56s)]
*  It felt awesome. I felt great. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4872.56s)]
*  Last night's leg felt great? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4874.56s)]
*  No, I'm saying before that. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4876.56s)]
*  I got out of the keto flu. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4878.56s)]
*  Maybe there's something to wrestle with. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4880.56s)]
*  I had it in my arms, too. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4882.56s)]
*  I was like a dead bug. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4884.56s)]
*  I was in my bed. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4886.56s)]
*  I think it was an electrolyte thing. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4888.56s)]
*  I looked it up. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4890.56s)]
*  I'm going to try it again. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4892.56s)]
*  Do you take an electrolyte supplement? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4894.56s)]
*  You should. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4896.56s)]
*  Take this stuff called Liquid IV. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4898.56s)]
*  It's great. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4900.56s)]
*  Filled with vitamins and electrolytes. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4902.56s)]
*  So many people are deficient [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4904.56s)]
*  in certain nutrients. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4906.56s)]
*  So many people are dehydrated. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4908.56s)]
*  It's so easy to be dehydrated. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4910.56s)]
*  You really should be drinking water [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4912.56s)]
*  all the fucking time. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4914.56s)]
*  I felt good, though. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4916.56s)]
*  I didn't realize how different you feel. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4918.56s)]
*  First of all, you don't need to eat them. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4920.56s)]
*  I was crushing carbs. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4922.56s)]
*  I went down to not eating any. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4924.56s)]
*  I didn't know I didn't need that my whole life. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4926.56s)]
*  I think different people react different ways. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4928.56s)]
*  I have a buddy that's been on keto now [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4930.56s)]
*  for six months. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4932.56s)]
*  He's lost 60 pounds. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4934.56s)]
*  He looks fucking great. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4936.56s)]
*  Dana White lost 40 pounds. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4938.56s)]
*  He's like, dude, I'm eating like this [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4940.56s)]
*  for the rest of my life. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4942.56s)]
*  It was all just sugar and bullshit and carbs. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4944.56s)]
*  He was having all sorts of health problems. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4946.56s)]
*  But my buddy looks fucking great. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4948.56s)]
*  John Dudley. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4950.56s)]
*  He looks great. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4952.56s)]
*  He's like thin now. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4954.56s)]
*  He lost 25 and now he's 200 pounds. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4956.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4958.56s)]
*  At one point in time, he was like 250. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4960.56s)]
*  He's a big boy. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4962.56s)]
*  Now he looks fucking lean and mean. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4964.56s)]
*  He's like, my joints feel amazing. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4966.56s)]
*  My energy levels are great. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4968.56s)]
*  I just don't think it's for everybody. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4970.56s)]
*  I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all diet. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4972.56s)]
*  I know a lot of people that just go vegan [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4974.56s)]
*  and they're fine. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4976.56s)]
*  I know a lot of people that try [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4978.56s)]
*  and their body gets fucked up. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4980.56s)]
*  Everybody's different, man. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4982.56s)]
*  What happened to Bill? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4984.56s)]
*  Clinton. He looks like shit. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4986.56s)]
*  But I think it's also guilt. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4988.56s)]
*  A lot of sleepless nights. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4990.56s)]
*  A lot of thinking about all the shit he did. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4992.56s)]
*  Imagine the internet coming out [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4994.56s)]
*  towards the end and that comes out [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4996.56s)]
*  and they're like, oh, fuck. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=4998.56s)]
*  Not just that, but having to live with [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5000.56s)]
*  being the president and all the shit [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5002.56s)]
*  that you gave the fucking thumbs up to [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5004.56s)]
*  and all the people that died [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5006.56s)]
*  and all the countries that got invaded [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5008.56s)]
*  and all the fucking black ops [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5010.56s)]
*  that you were all about and all the people [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5012.56s)]
*  that got assassinated and all the people that... [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5014.56s)]
*  How about the Obama administration? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5016.56s)]
*  How many people died from drone strikes [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5018.56s)]
*  that were innocent? A lot. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5020.56s)]
*  It was in the 90% range [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5022.56s)]
*  of civilians, of innocent people [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5024.56s)]
*  that died in these [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5026.56s)]
*  targeted surgical drone strikes. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5028.56s)]
*  And then an amazing term you could use, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5030.56s)]
*  surgical for a missile with a bomb on the other. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5032.56s)]
*  Very precise. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5036.56s)]
*  Surgical strikes. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5038.56s)]
*  Silent dinner, silent pot roast [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5040.56s)]
*  with Hillary Clinton, dude. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5042.56s)]
*  Your bill, just a silent fucking... [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5044.56s)]
*  You fucked up something on the news and she's not talking to you? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5046.56s)]
*  She's in her pantsuit just like... [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5048.56s)]
*  They have some sort of an arrangement. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5050.56s)]
*  I can only imagine. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5052.56s)]
*  You think they're just totally different [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5054.56s)]
*  wings of the house or something? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5056.56s)]
*  They're partners, they're business partners. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5058.56s)]

*  In terms of who would have been a better [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5064.56s)]
*  president representing the country, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5066.56s)]
*  would have been her or Biden, her by a long shot. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5068.56s)]
*  Even if you don't agree with her politics [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5070.56s)]
*  or you think she's a criminal, that lady's [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5072.56s)]

*  sometimes just to get fucked up. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5214.56s)]
*  It's fun to drink on. You take Adderall, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5216.56s)]
*  you can drink all day. You can drink all [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5218.56s)]

*  and drink until my body shuts down. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5224.56s)]
*  But because of the Adderall, you're [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5226.56s)]

*  what's going on? And then we tried to leave [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5236.56s)]
*  the stadium. I was like, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5238.56s)]

*  Yeah, so I can call a duty when your character dies, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5246.56s)]
*  but you get the camera to float around the whole thing. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5248.56s)]
*  If you take Adderall, you can day drink. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5250.56s)]
*  Because I don't, yeah. I get crazy. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5252.56s)]
*  I can't drink on Adderall. How often do you take it? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5254.56s)]
*  That was the two times I've taken it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5256.56s)]
*  Damn, it seems exciting. Ohio State, Notre Dame, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5258.56s)]
*  World Series. It's a big day. If I'm taking [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5260.56s)]

*  to, sometimes you run into people [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5274.56s)]
*  that are like 30 fucking 40 [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5276.56s)]
*  milligrams. Crunch the time release. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5278.56s)]
*  We googled the number. I think Portnoy said it takes [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5280.56s)]
*  a 30. I was like, I didn't bring it up. I was like, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5282.56s)]
*  that's a lot. Some people munch the time release [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5284.56s)]
*  too. They have little balls and you can crack down on them [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5286.56s)]
*  and just get it all at once. Bro, I've tried to snort those [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5288.56s)]

*  evenings. I tried. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5292.56s)]
*  It's like plastic balls. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5294.56s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5298.56s)]
*  I tried drinking on it twice. The one time [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5300.56s)]
*  I was in college, I was [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5302.56s)]
*  on the Adderall. I didn't realize even what it was. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5304.56s)]
*  I was drinking on it. I got all zoomed out and I was [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5306.56s)]
*  at the kind of, not like a super [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5308.56s)]

*  I'm going to jump down to the next level. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5312.56s)]
*  I tried to jump down and I got [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5314.56s)]
*  kicked out immediately. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5316.56s)]
*  It was fucked up. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5318.56s)]
*  I could time it perfectly where all the guards' backs [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5320.56s)]
*  are turned. I'll jump down to the pit, climb up [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5322.56s)]
*  and jump into the other area. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5324.56s)]
*  You're trying to get up to the stage. It just snagged me. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5326.56s)]
*  Yeah, of course. It snagged me. You're a mess. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5328.56s)]
*  I was like, I'll jump into the crowd. I'll blend. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5330.56s)]
*  The crowd just parted as I [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5332.56s)]
*  jumped into them. The guy just beat the fuck out of me. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5334.56s)]
*  I was at a South Carolina beer. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5336.56s)]
*  He saw you jump down. He knocked my one shoe off. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5338.56s)]
*  I got back in [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5340.56s)]

*  suspicious. I walked in in my socks [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5344.56s)]
*  and they thought my friend was me and they started kicking [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5346.56s)]
*  him out. I just thought it happened. I was like, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5348.56s)]
*  fuck it. My friend had to get kicked out. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5350.56s)]
*  Then I got kicked out again. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5352.56s)]
*  Then I snuck back in a third time. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5354.56s)]
*  No lie. In my socks. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5356.56s)]

*  Yeah, that lady is a psycho. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5764.56s)]
*  She's staring down that bat. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5766.56s)]
*  This shows your deepest layer. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5768.56s)]
*  Solid photos to snag too. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5772.56s)]
*  The photographer getting all that caught. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5774.56s)]
*  Every single one of those photographers went, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5776.56s)]
*  Dude, I got that. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5778.56s)]
*  They have to be on point for that. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5780.56s)]
*  You have to be ready. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5782.56s)]
*  That does happen. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5784.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5786.56s)]
*  That guy is fucking dope. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5788.56s)]
*  Look at the size of the John Cena arms on that motherfucker. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5790.56s)]
*  That guy is a tank. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5792.56s)]
*  Imagine if he was doing like this. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5794.56s)]
*  That looks like his kid. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5796.56s)]
*  Definitely his boy. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5798.56s)]
*  The kid doesn't even see it. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5800.56s)]
*  Look at the kid's face. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5802.56s)]
*  That guy is using the force. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5804.56s)]
*  That might not be his kid. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5806.56s)]
*  There's two kids. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5808.56s)]
*  Look at the little girl next to him. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5810.56s)]
*  Smart as fuck. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5812.56s)]
*  She's like, down! [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5814.56s)]
*  It might be the mom. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5816.56s)]
*  Whoever it is, they just ducked. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5818.56s)]
*  I doubt it's the mom. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5820.56s)]
*  Oh, that's the real mom. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5822.56s)]
*  That's the row in front of them. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5824.56s)]
*  That's what that is. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5826.56s)]
*  The dude is next to them. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5828.56s)]
*  The black dude up there. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5830.56s)]
*  I think moms have a thing innately where they genuinely can't get out of the way. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5832.56s)]
*  They'll just stick their head in the way. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5836.56s)]
*  You ever drive with your mom in the car? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5838.56s)]
*  Yeah, they put their hand over it. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5840.56s)]
*  Every single time. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5842.56s)]
*  It's pretty sweet actually. It's very nice. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5844.56s)]
*  My wife does that to me sometimes. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5846.56s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5848.56s)]
*  How much strength do you think you have that way? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5850.56s)]
*  None. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5852.56s)]
*  How much resistance do you have? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5854.56s)]
*  Have you ever tested backstroke? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5856.56s)]
*  Have you ever tested a bucked arm? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5858.56s)]
*  No. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5860.56s)]
*  She does it with the kids. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5862.56s)]
*  It's a natural thing to do with the kids when they're hitting the brakes. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5864.56s)]
*  You have zero power that way. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5866.56s)]
*  It's on the fucking road. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5868.56s)]
*  Hold the steering wheel. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5870.56s)]
*  How much can you stop going in that direction? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5872.56s)]
*  With your arm outstretched like that and you weigh 130 pounds. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5874.56s)]
*  This is going to be a very dark statement, but I don't know. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5878.56s)]
*  What? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5882.56s)]
*  That means every single time a mom's in a car accident with her kid, a severe one, she did go like this. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5884.56s)]
*  The last thing she felt was he's going out. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5888.56s)]
*  When I was a kid we didn't wear seatbelts. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5892.56s)]
*  Nobody wore seatbelts. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5894.56s)]
*  We used to all pretend. We would laugh. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5896.56s)]
*  My parents would be like, you guys clicked in and we'd all go click with our, like make the noise with our mouse. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5898.56s)]
*  They'd be like, haha, and they'd laugh. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5900.56s)]
*  My dad, when they started beeping they just cut their seatbelts off and plugged them in. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5902.56s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5906.56s)]
*  Seatbelts were gay. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5908.56s)]
*  Dude. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5910.56s)]
*  Now they're not. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5912.56s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5914.56s)]
*  Whoever did seatbelts had a fucking PR. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5916.56s)]
*  It used to be if you wore a seatbelt you were a pussy. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5918.56s)]
*  If you're a cool guy in a muscle car movie you didn't have a seatbelt. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5920.56s)]
*  When did that change? What happened? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5922.56s)]
*  Paul Walker. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5924.56s)]
*  Dudes would be driving in cars and not wearing seatbelts. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5926.56s)]
*  Fast and the Furious might have been seatbelt propaganda. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5928.56s)]
*  Might have been the CCP. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5930.56s)]
*  It could have been the CCP. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5932.56s)]
*  They manufacture all the seatbelts. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5934.56s)]
*  True. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5936.56s)]
*  They probably do. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5938.56s)]
*  Bro. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5940.56s)]
*  Paul Walker. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5942.56s)]
*  Seatbelt China. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5944.56s)]
*  Hold on. Jamie, will you find that old woman getting hit in the face with a basketball? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5946.56s)]
*  No, we're done. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5950.56s)]
*  No, I want to see this lady get hit in the face. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5952.56s)]
*  It's a very funny video and then we can find a new topic. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5954.56s)]
*  There's nothing like rodeo guys getting stomped. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5956.56s)]
*  Well that's actually like... [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5958.56s)]
*  Death. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5960.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5962.56s)]
*  Or running with the bulls. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5964.56s)]
*  It's funny, right? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5966.56s)]
*  Running with the bulls though, rodeo guys are at least like, this is a sport, all this. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5968.56s)]
*  It's a sport where there's only one person who knows they're participating. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5972.56s)]
*  Running with the bulls has it coming. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5976.56s)]
*  How does she get hit? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5978.56s)]
*  It'll happen once and then it gets zoomed in so you can see it. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5980.56s)]
*  That's in real time. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5982.56s)]
*  Right in the mug. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5984.56s)]
*  Oh, she wasn't looking. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5986.56s)]
*  She wasn't looking at all. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5988.56s)]
*  Oh! [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5990.56s)]
*  Look at that Facebook. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5992.56s)]
*  That was like a chain email. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5994.56s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=5996.56s)]

*  Fuck, fuck, fuck. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6008.56s)]
*  That dude is so bad. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6010.56s)]
*  He was trying to block it. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6012.56s)]
*  She didn't even know it happened. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6014.56s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6016.56s)]
*  That's not well though. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6018.56s)]
*  That makes me happy. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6020.56s)]
*  She's alright. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6022.56s)]
*  A basketball, you're alright. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6024.56s)]
*  That's a marshal Brady at the worst. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6026.56s)]
*  She could have a little splash. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6028.56s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6030.56s)]
*  Does she stay in the game? [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6032.56s)]
*  She's supposed to stand up with her arms over here like, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6034.56s)]
*  Look at her, she's smiling. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6036.56s)]
*  She took it well. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6038.56s)]
*  She loves the shot. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6040.56s)]
*  One more time, Jamie, really? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6042.56s)]
*  And by the way, Hornet's ball. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6044.56s)]
*  Hornet's get the ball back, dude. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6046.56s)]
*  Fuck the Kings. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6048.56s)]
*  Sacramento versus Charlotte. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6050.56s)]

*  Trying to watch the Kings, Hornet's. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6054.56s)]
*  Six seats too. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6056.56s)]
*  She's not even paying attention. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6058.56s)]
*  What year was she looking at her Facebook? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6060.56s)]
*  I was recent. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6062.56s)]

*  Have you seen an old person that's paying attention to their phone, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6070.56s)]
*  they get hit by something, they're always on Facebook. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6072.56s)]
*  No. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6074.56s)]
*  It's Facebook, that's the platform. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6076.56s)]
*  That's all old people. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6078.56s)]
*  Geezer's love Facebook. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6080.56s)]

*  Fucking rules. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6084.56s)]
*  But why is it for... [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6086.56s)]
*  Is it political arguments? [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6088.56s)]
*  What happened to everybody I knew ever? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6090.56s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it's like, [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6092.56s)]
*  Holy shit, this is what they're up to? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6094.56s)]
*  Your kids look great. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6096.56s)]
*  Do you ever catch an ex stalking your Facebook? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6098.56s)]
*  I don't have Facebook. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6100.56s)]
*  I don't have my idea. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6102.56s)]
*  I had one, I deleted it. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6104.56s)]
*  And then I got a new one because I wanted to see a group. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6106.56s)]
*  But I never go on. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6108.56s)]
*  It's important for open micers. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6110.56s)]
*  Because that's the only way you can fight all the other comics in the local scenes Facebook page. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6112.56s)]
*  Everybody just fights in there. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6116.56s)]
*  When you go off of Facebook for years and go back on, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6118.56s)]
*  it's kind of eerie. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6120.56s)]
*  Because then you see people writing the same kind of stuff like two years later. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6122.56s)]
*  And you go, whoa. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6124.56s)]
*  That's kind of fucked up. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6126.56s)]
*  It's kind of like a big time suck. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6128.56s)]
*  I'm definitely a time suck. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6130.56s)]
*  They're so addictive. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6132.56s)]
*  All these social media apps are so addictive. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6134.56s)]
*  Watching people get fat on it's nice. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6136.56s)]
*  You get to go back in their pictures and watch the trends. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6138.56s)]
*  You go, oh man. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6140.56s)]
*  You go back to 2014, let's go to the present. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6142.56s)]
*  You go, ooh, you got sad. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6144.56s)]
*  You were sad for a few years. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6146.56s)]
*  I can see it. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6148.56s)]
*  During COVID, how many people just developed heavy drinking problems? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6150.56s)]
*  That must have been kind of fun to watch during COVID. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6152.56s)]
*  People's unhinged Facebook. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6154.56s)]
*  Idiots. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6156.56s)]
*  I had friends that just were drinking wine every night. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6158.56s)]
*  Every night. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6160.56s)]
*  They were like, I think we got a problem. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6162.56s)]
*  Wine every night. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6164.56s)]
*  They were polishing off two bottles a night. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6166.56s)]
*  No, I know. That's what I mean. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6168.56s)]
*  Just crushing by yourself. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6170.56s)]
*  Trapped in your house. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6172.56s)]
*  That was so fucked up. We got trapped in our houses. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6174.56s)]
*  That was crazy. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6176.56s)]
*  I missed it. I loved it so much. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6178.56s)]
*  I was at my parents' house. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6180.56s)]
*  Again, I got NCAA 14. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6182.56s)]
*  I was playing Xbox in my parents' basement. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6184.56s)]
*  Shit rules. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6186.56s)]
*  You didn't feel like a loser at all? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6188.56s)]
*  How could you? No one's doing anything. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6190.56s)]
*  That's the best part. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6192.56s)]
*  No one's doing anything. You could be a loser. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6194.56s)]
*  You were allowed to fuck off. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6196.56s)]
*  Everyone was fucking off. It's like the world got a vacation. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6198.56s)]
*  Turns out the economy doesn't work that way. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6200.56s)]
*  Turns out it is going to backfire. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6202.56s)]
*  I'll be alright. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6204.56s)]
*  Outside of missing the days in the basement, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6206.56s)]
*  this was two years ago. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6210.56s)]
*  I was in my parents' basement. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6212.56s)]
*  I would be like, dinner. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6214.56s)]
*  Two years ago, we were all scared. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6216.56s)]
*  Locked in. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6218.56s)]
*  I just had my first kid. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6220.56s)]
*  I had to make the call. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6222.56s)]
*  I'd be like, nah, fuck this stuff. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6224.56s)]
*  My wife's like, if you fucking get this wrong. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6226.56s)]
*  I'm like, nah, dude, don't worry. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6228.56s)]
*  I checked out the death rates. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6230.56s)]
*  I'm like, bro, the odds are pretty good. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6232.56s)]
*  We'll be fine. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6234.56s)]
*  As soon as I looked up the age, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6236.56s)]
*  I was like, oh, dude, don't worry about this. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6238.56s)]
*  She was like, you can't go out. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6240.56s)]
*  She was in like, primal fear mode. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6242.56s)]
*  I had to be like, trust me, dude. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6244.56s)]
*  I can go out and go copy these mushrooms and chocolates. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6246.56s)]
*  It's very lucky that it's not scary at all for kids. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6248.56s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6250.56s)]
*  It's very lucky. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6252.56s)]
*  It's ideal. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6254.56s)]
*  Well, the flu is worse for a lot of kids. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6256.56s)]
*  This is what I... [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6258.56s)]
*  How many ways? You guys talk. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6260.56s)]
*  This is my thing. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6262.56s)]
*  Once they figured out... [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6264.56s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6266.56s)]
*  Once they figured out, it fucked the older people up big time. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6268.56s)]
*  If I'm 80 years old, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6270.56s)]
*  I'd like to think I would be like, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6272.56s)]
*  yeah, I'll take it, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6274.56s)]
*  but if you're like... I wouldn't tell my grandkids if they didn't know what it was. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6276.56s)]
*  Well, they thought in the beginning [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6278.56s)]
*  that it was going to stop transmission, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6280.56s)]
*  stop people from getting infected, and that it was safe and effective. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6282.56s)]
*  So it made sense that everybody's like, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6284.56s)]
*  you got it yet. You got it. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6286.56s)]
*  Is that what it was? Yeah. It made sense. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6288.56s)]
*  It totally made the hysteria make sense. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6290.56s)]
*  People weren't given the best information. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6292.56s)]
*  Do you ever see the CEO of Pfizer [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6294.56s)]
*  talk about it now? It's crazy [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6296.56s)]
*  the way he describes it. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6298.56s)]
*  He goes, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6300.56s)]
*  one to two shots... [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6302.56s)]
*  See if you can find this, Jamie. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6304.56s)]
*  He goes, one to two shots [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6306.56s)]
*  gives you [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6308.56s)]
*  very little protection, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6310.56s)]
*  if any at all, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6312.56s)]
*  and the third shot gives you [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6314.56s)]
*  reasonable protection from [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6316.56s)]
*  hospitalization and death. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6318.56s)]
*  That's what he's saying now. That's what he said [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6320.56s)]
*  in some sort of a speech. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6322.56s)]
*  I don't know when this was, but to hear him say it that way [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6324.56s)]
*  I was like, I have never heard you say it this way before. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6326.56s)]
*  I've never heard anybody say it this way before. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6328.56s)]
*  Yeah, again, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6330.56s)]
*  it's already like, yeah, make heads or tails of it, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6332.56s)]
*  but I don't know. When it came out, I was like, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6334.56s)]
*  wait, I'm also scared of needles. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6336.56s)]
*  When it came out, I was like, nah, I'll wait. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6338.56s)]
*  Is that it for here? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6340.56s)]
*  Two doses are not enough for Omicron. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6342.56s)]
*  The third dose, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6344.56s)]
*  quite good protection against deaths and decent [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6346.56s)]
*  protection against hospitalization. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6348.56s)]
*  What the fuck does decent mean, though? [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6350.56s)]
*  It's weird to hear him say it, though. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6352.56s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be like, you'll be kind of stoked on it. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6354.56s)]
*  It's like, thanks, dude. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6356.56s)]

*  the hospitalizations and [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6424.56s)]
*  the severe disease, it is [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6426.56s)]
*  reasonable right now, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6428.56s)]
*  with the current vaccines, as long as you are having, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6430.56s)]

*  This vaccine will be ready [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6434.56s)]
*  in March. Yeah, that's not it. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6436.56s)]
*  I'm trying to find... I know he's... [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6438.56s)]
*  Nate Diaz is on it. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6440.56s)]
*  But now they're finding out that the new [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6442.56s)]
*  one, this [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6444.56s)]
*  bivalent [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6446.56s)]
*  vaccine, the new data shows that it's [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6448.56s)]
*  no more effective than the other [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6450.56s)]
*  vaccines. Well, did you ever get into the antidepressant stuff? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6452.56s)]
*  How that, like, the serotonin hypothesis... [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6454.56s)]
*  That you're allowed to do as many [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6456.56s)]
*  studies as you want, and if you get [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6458.56s)]
*  the one that kind of, like, is statistically significant, [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6460.56s)]
*  then you can be like, alright, that's our one, run it. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6462.56s)]
*  And it's like, you could have, like, 800 dogs [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6464.56s)]
*  and have one good one and be like, we got the numbers. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6466.56s)]
*  Exactly. It's fucked up. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6468.56s)]
*  And it's never been, as far as I know, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6470.56s)]
*  the whole hypothesis [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6472.56s)]
*  hasn't been, like, proven to, like, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6474.56s)]
*  even if you use, like, clinical significance, like, does it [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6476.56s)]
*  actually work in theory? Like, cause when you, like, [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6478.56s)]
*  when they're doing, like, p-values and shit, you can [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6480.56s)]
*  fuck around with math. And just get like, oh, it's [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6482.56s)]
*  .05, and it's like, cool. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6484.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, they... I fucking hate [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6486.56s)]
*  p-values. Dude, it doesn't make any sense. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6488.56s)]
*  They bailed on the concept that [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6490.56s)]
*  it's a chemical [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6492.56s)]
*  imbalance. They said there's no evidence [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6494.56s)]
*  that it's a chemical imbalance. Are we talking depression? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6496.56s)]
*  Yeah, man. Ooh. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6498.56s)]
*  Well, that was the thing that they'd always said about [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6500.56s)]
*  the reason why SSRIs work. Yeah. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6502.56s)]
*  Is it combats a chemical [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6504.56s)]
*  imbalance. But now, find that. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6506.56s)]
*  Find the paper that shows [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6508.56s)]
*  that there's no real [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6510.56s)]
*  evidence that there's a chemical imbalance. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6512.56s)]
*  Did they ever figure out, when did they start [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6514.56s)]
*  putting kids on this stuff? [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6516.56s)]
*  Oh, man. True. When did Combine happen? [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6518.56s)]
*  They've looked at that stuff [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6520.56s)]
*  before. Cause that seems kind of... Well, there was Chantix. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6522.56s)]
*  Chantix was the anti-smoking, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6524.56s)]
*  I think, one. And that, like, there was a lawsuit [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6526.56s)]
*  for that. That was like really fucking... What if school shootings [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6528.56s)]
*  really skyrocketed? Is it... Dude, all I'm [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6530.56s)]
*  saying is they... I don't [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6532.56s)]
*  want to say lie about the SSRI thing, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6534.56s)]
*  but it was like, dude, they didn't give the full picture [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6536.56s)]
*  on those. Then there was Oxycontin. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6538.56s)]
*  Depression is not caused by chemical [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6540.56s)]
*  imbalance in the brain. Yeah, dude. We don't [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6542.56s)]
*  know how anti-depressants work. There's [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6544.56s)]
*  no convincing evidence that depression is [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6546.56s)]
*  caused by serotonin abnormalities. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6548.56s)]
*  Many people take anti-depressants believing [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6550.56s)]
*  their depression as a biochemical [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6552.56s)]
*  cause. Research does not support [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6554.56s)]
*  this belief. The notion [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6556.56s)]
*  that anti-depressants work by elevating [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6558.56s)]
*  serotonin levels is not supported by [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6560.56s)]
*  the evidence. Whoa. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6562.56s)]
*  Dude, and they [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6564.56s)]
*  gave these... And the side effects [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6566.56s)]
*  of these things are fucked up. They're [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6568.56s)]
*  very bad. This is what's crazy. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6570.56s)]
*  Carries... Look at this. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6572.56s)]
*  Major depression is one of [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6574.56s)]
*  the most common psychological [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6576.56s)]
*  disorders affecting more [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6578.56s)]
*  than 23 million adults and adolescents [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6580.56s)]
*  each year. It carries economic costs [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6582.56s)]
*  in the hundreds of billions and is a major [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6584.56s)]
*  risk factor for suicide. The causes [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6586.56s)]
*  of depression have not been debated [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6588.56s)]
*  yet. A common explanation holds the [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6590.56s)]
*  culprit is chemical imbalance [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6592.56s)]
*  in the brain. This notion emerged [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6594.56s)]
*  not coincidentally in the late 80s [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6596.56s)]
*  with the introduction of Prozac. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6598.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. A drug [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6600.56s)]
*  that appeared to help in treating depression [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6602.56s)]
*  by increasing the [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6604.56s)]
*  levels of the brain transmitter [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6606.56s)]
*  serotonin. So it makes you feel better. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6608.56s)]
*  And so they said, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6610.56s)]
*  oh, you must have a chemical imbalance. They just [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6612.56s)]
*  juice people up. Juice them up with serotonin. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6614.56s)]
*  Like, yay. And that makes you feel [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6616.56s)]
*  better. Yeah, it's... I'm all right [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6618.56s)]
*  with it. It's fucked. With what? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6620.56s)]
*  Just fuck it, dude. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6622.56s)]
*  You're a cubicle. Jack it up, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6624.56s)]
*  dude. Take that shit. Take [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6626.56s)]
*  fucking heroin. How many people do you [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6628.56s)]
*  know that are on Prozac? It looks like a good time. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6630.56s)]
*  Almost everyone. Everyone you know [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6632.56s)]
*  is on Prozac. I think a lot of people [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6634.56s)]
*  are on like anti-anxiety. I think a third of women [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6636.56s)]
*  are on it. Women cross-med. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6638.56s)]
*  Something like an anti-depressant, I think. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6640.56s)]
*  I think it's a third of women. I bet you feel great [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6642.56s)]
*  in, yeah, anti-anxiety. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6644.56s)]
*  It dulls you. I think at first [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6646.56s)]
*  it's like nice, and then it dulls you. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6648.56s)]
*  From what I've heard, you just stop feeling stuff about anything. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6650.56s)]
*  And then you need to keep upping the dose and up [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6652.56s)]
*  the dose, and it increases your weight gain. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6654.56s)]
*  Because then you've got to keep making all the serotonin. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6656.56s)]
*  I think serotonin is made from [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6658.56s)]
*  carbohydrates. Like, you need [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6660.56s)]
*  carbs to make it so people gain weight because they start [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6662.56s)]
*  fucking gorging themselves on snacks. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6664.56s)]
*  Oh, really? And then you get all the sexual [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6666.56s)]
*  dysfunction, ED. What about [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6668.56s)]
*  5-HTP? There's serotonin [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6670.56s)]
*  precursors that you could take. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6672.56s)]
*  Maybe, but here's my thing. If they cause [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6674.56s)]
*  erectile dysfunction, how are you going to be [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6676.56s)]
*  happy without a boner? With SSRIs? Yes. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6678.56s)]
*  Big time ones. How are you going to be happy without a boner, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6680.56s)]
*  Pfizer? For real, every time I've done coke [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6682.56s)]
*  I've been pretty happy. Imagine them. A boner was [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6684.56s)]
*  nowhere in sight. Imagine them [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6686.56s)]
*  and Adderall. SSRIs and Adderall [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6688.56s)]
*  together. You literally don't have a penis. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6690.56s)]
*  It'd be an any. You forget [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6692.56s)]
*  you took Adderall because you're hammered. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6694.56s)]
*  You go to the bathroom [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6696.56s)]
*  and chances are I'm at a football game or a stadium. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6698.56s)]
*  So there's guys next to me. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6700.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? You go up to the urinal, you go [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6702.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6704.56s)]
*  You just can't get out. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6706.56s)]
*  News of this cannot spread. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6708.56s)]
*  You're pissing all over your underwear. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6710.56s)]
*  Yo, your dick is fucking this big. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6712.56s)]
*  You've got to break the plane at that point. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6714.56s)]
*  At that point you're going all the way in. Your dick breaks the plane. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6716.56s)]
*  Your penis is going up. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6718.56s)]
*  You're pissing it up. That's how small your dick is. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6720.56s)]
*  Prozac and Adderall could result [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6722.56s)]
*  in serotonin syndrome, a potentially [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6724.56s)]
*  serious condition. Unless closely [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6726.56s)]
*  monitored by a doctor you should not take Adderall [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6728.56s)]
*  and Prozac together. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6730.56s)]
*  You probably shouldn't take any of this shit. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6732.56s)]
*  Let's try to have a good time. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6734.56s)]
*  I'm pretty sure anxiety and depression are baked into [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6736.56s)]
*  the human experience. I don't think you can get away from it. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6738.56s)]
*  You sound like a good Catholic. That's what I'm saying, man. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6740.56s)]
*  That's what being Catholic is all about. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6742.56s)]
*  I used to have wicked panic attacks when I was 23. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6744.56s)]
*  And I was also a gigantic piece of shit. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6746.56s)]
*  And it was the thing that [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6748.56s)]
*  made me start thinking about my life. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6750.56s)]
*  I was shocking in my... [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6752.56s)]
*  And if I had just gotten medication [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6754.56s)]
*  I would have kept being a giant piece of shit. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6756.56s)]
*  So I'm always like [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6758.56s)]
*  Sometimes you gotta go through it, you know what I mean? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6760.56s)]
*  You gotta slough through that stuff. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6762.56s)]
*  I was a fucking... [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6764.56s)]
*  I was a piece of shit. I just fucking had to [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6766.56s)]
*  come to grips with the fact that I was going to die eventually. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6768.56s)]
*  When you say [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6770.56s)]
*  a piece of shit you were just... [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6772.56s)]
*  What were you doing? [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6774.56s)]
*  What were you taking? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6776.56s)]
*  What were you doing? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6778.56s)]
*  Selling drugs. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6780.56s)]
*  I had no excuse. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6782.56s)]
*  I wasn't like my back to the wall. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6784.56s)]
*  I just got a couple jobs and I was like [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6786.56s)]
*  I don't like this. I should sell drugs. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6788.56s)]
*  What kind of drugs are you selling? [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6790.56s)]
*  Pretty much everything. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6792.56s)]
*  Weed was the mainstay. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6794.56s)]
*  But then I got coerced into... [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6796.56s)]
*  I didn't even know what pills did. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6798.56s)]
*  So my friends would talk me into going and finding pills for them. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6800.56s)]
*  It was a bad news. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6802.56s)]
*  How did you get out of it? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6804.56s)]
*  Just stopped eventually. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6806.56s)]
*  Patreon. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6808.56s)]

*  Thank you Patreon. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6812.56s)]
*  I didn't know what pills did. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6814.56s)]
*  I remember watching a whole [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6816.56s)]
*  not even a whole but like it was an apartment complex [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6818.56s)]
*  and there were these two buildings full of all these kids [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6820.56s)]
*  that were living there. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6822.56s)]
*  It was a long story but I somehow got my hands on [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6824.56s)]
*  Watson pharmaceutical drugs. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6826.56s)]
*  They were Vicodins. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6828.56s)]
*  I love that I somehow got my hands on jugs of Vicodins. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6830.56s)]
*  That's never happened to me. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6836.56s)]
*  I've never stumbled upon any jugs of Vicodins. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6838.56s)]
*  I've never opened up a cabinet. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6840.56s)]
*  Look at these jugs. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6842.56s)]
*  What's a jug of Vicodin? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6844.56s)]
*  How many are we talking? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6846.56s)]
*  When you're at the pharmacy and you look behind the counter [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6848.56s)]
*  it's those big boys. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6850.56s)]
*  Like a whey protein bottle? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6852.56s)]
*  Scoop protein? [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6854.56s)]
*  How much was that worth? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6856.56s)]
*  You're going to jail. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6858.56s)]
*  You're talking about this on the podcast. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6860.56s)]
*  Statue of limitations. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6862.56s)]
*  What is the statue of limitations? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6864.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6866.56s)]
*  Statue of limitations. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6868.56s)]
*  Statue of limitations dude. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6870.56s)]
*  I'm in the clear. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6872.56s)]
*  It's over. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6874.56s)]
*  Mushrooms kicked in. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6876.56s)]
*  That's basically the thing. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6878.56s)]
*  I was just a fucking nightmare. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6880.56s)]
*  That was the thing. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6882.56s)]
*  Statue of limitations. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6884.56s)]
*  Before the statute. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6886.56s)]
*  The French gave us this. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6888.56s)]
*  I was laying in bed just going [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6890.56s)]
*  What the fuck am I doing with my fucking life? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6892.56s)]
*  Having panic attacks. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6894.56s)]
*  It forced me to be like, [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6896.56s)]
*  It's probably a pretty bad idea. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6898.56s)]
*  How did you phase out of it? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6900.56s)]
*  I just stopped. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6902.56s)]
*  It made me develop a sense of like, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6904.56s)]
*  This is fucking other people up. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6906.56s)]
*  I saw people getting fucked up. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6908.56s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to stop doing this. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6910.56s)]
*  How many times did you get robbed at gunpoint? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6912.56s)]
*  I went back. The plug robbed me at gunpoint. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6914.56s)]
*  He was like, I won't do it again. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6916.56s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6918.56s)]
*  The plug? What's the plug? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6920.56s)]
*  Dude, who's your supplier? [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6922.56s)]
*  Your supplier robbed you at gunpoint? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6924.56s)]
*  It was kind of a mess. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6926.56s)]
*  I would give him money and he would go get them. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6928.56s)]
*  Then one time he came back without them. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6930.56s)]
*  I was like, dude, just have them. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6932.56s)]
*  I was so scared of these guys. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6934.56s)]
*  I was like, you can just keep it all. I don't care. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6936.56s)]
*  He was like, how do I know you didn't set me up? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6938.56s)]
*  He pulled a gun out on me. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6940.56s)]
*  I went, ahhh. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6942.56s)]
*  They both just ran out. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6944.56s)]
*  Then you tried to buy from him again? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6946.56s)]
*  No, I told him. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6948.56s)]
*  Time passed. He was like, dude, I'm so sorry. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6950.56s)]
*  I found out who actually robbed me. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6952.56s)]
*  He's like, if you could come back, I'll take care of you. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6954.56s)]
*  I'll make it worth your while. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6956.56s)]
*  You'll never have to put any money up ever again. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6958.56s)]
*  Then what happened? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6960.56s)]
*  I just went back. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6962.56s)]
*  Then apparently he got in trouble. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6964.56s)]
*  I think he tried to shoot at somebody. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6966.56s)]
*  I went back to pay him back one time. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6968.56s)]
*  Some guy was like, nah, he's in jail. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6970.56s)]
*  He tried to shoot someone. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6972.56s)]
*  You said he pulled a gun on you twice? [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6974.56s)]
*  Once. A different guy pulled a gun on me. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6976.56s)]
*  You said he would never do it again? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6978.56s)]
*  He didn't. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6980.56s)]
*  He was true to his word. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6982.56s)]
*  So that guy would never do it again? [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6984.56s)]
*  Or the other guy did it? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6986.56s)]
*  Some other guy. I was in a house and a guy came in with a gun. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6988.56s)]
*  That stunk. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6990.56s)]
*  What was this about? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6992.56s)]
*  Weed. Pounds. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6994.56s)]
*  You said, give me your weed? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6996.56s)]
*  He goes, oh my god, some guy happened to be behind me with a gun. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=6998.56s)]
*  Everyone get down. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7000.56s)]
*  I was sitting there like, this is bullshit. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7002.56s)]
*  Then he took the money. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7004.56s)]
*  Then he was like, who the fuck? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7006.56s)]
*  He started telling me I was on his territory. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7008.56s)]
*  I was like, dude, come on, man. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7010.56s)]
*  I just sat there and he talked for two minutes. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7012.56s)]
*  He was like, if you guys try to look out the window, [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7014.56s)]
*  there's people outside that are going to shoot you. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7016.56s)]
*  He took all of our cell phones. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7018.56s)]
*  I did have a thousand bucks behind my back though. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7020.56s)]
*  I didn't tell him about it, so I got to keep that. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7022.56s)]
*  That's pretty sweet. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7024.56s)]
*  You would have lost the composure. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7026.56s)]
*  Thankfully that other guy pulled his gun on you before. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7028.56s)]
*  What happens though is you lose, everything slows down. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7030.56s)]
*  The first time I just shit my pants, the second time I was looking at the kid who I never met before, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7032.56s)]
*  who I knew kind of set this up, because I watched one kid I knew being in a real state of fear. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7040.56s)]
*  I watched this other guy pretending to be scared. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7044.56s)]
*  All while this guy in a ski mask was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, with a gun. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7046.56s)]
*  It was just like, fuck, I really hope. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7050.56s)]
*  The part of my brain, I might get shot, just went offline. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7052.56s)]
*  I was able to watch and be like, I'm going to fucking kill this little motherfucker when this guy, blah, blah, blah. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7054.56s)]
*  How long after that did you stop? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7060.56s)]
*  A couple years. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7064.56s)]
*  I was chasing the bag, dude. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7066.56s)]
*  I got robbed. I didn't make any money. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7068.56s)]
*  I got robbed constantly. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7070.56s)]
*  I was too trusting. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7072.56s)]
*  I got robbed by Club one time, Clubpoint sucked. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7074.56s)]
*  Club? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7076.56s)]
*  These guys were like, we'll bash your brain. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7078.56s)]
*  Irishman with a Shalali. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7080.56s)]
*  Wait, have you got my cascada? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7082.56s)]
*  Not again. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7086.56s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7088.56s)]
*  He's a nonviolent drug dealer. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7090.56s)]
*  So how did you start making money when you quit? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7092.56s)]
*  I always worked in construction and stuff, too. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7096.56s)]
*  I'd always have a side gig, so I never depended on one too much. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7098.56s)]
*  So I could always say, fuck you to my job if I didn't like it. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7100.56s)]
*  And if things got weird, I could be like, I'm not going to do it. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7102.56s)]
*  I would chill. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7104.56s)]
*  So I had a kind of hybrid approach. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7106.56s)]
*  And how did you get into podcasting? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7108.56s)]
*  I was just a comedian. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7110.56s)]
*  Me and Shane were just living together. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7112.56s)]
*  I'm like, dude, can we please do a podcast? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7114.56s)]
*  I'm fucking dying here. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7116.56s)]
*  I was playing video games. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7118.56s)]
*  What is it called, in case we forget? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7120.56s)]
*  Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7122.56s)]
*  But yeah, man, that was not the way. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7124.56s)]
*  That was not the way. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7126.56s)]
*  No, it doesn't sound like the way. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7128.56s)]
*  But I was living... [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7130.56s)]
*  I have to say you got some good stories out of it, though, and you lived. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7132.56s)]
*  Pretty good, yeah. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7134.56s)]
*  But I was living according to a fucked up system. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7136.56s)]
*  And things called mental disorders got me out of it. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7138.56s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to say. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7140.56s)]
*  Where like, dude, my body was like, this is fucked up. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7142.56s)]
*  Dude, when you were crying? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7144.56s)]
*  When you were crying after you tried to sell real estate? [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7146.56s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7148.56s)]
*  I became a realtor, too. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7150.56s)]
*  I was 19, I was a realtor. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7152.56s)]
*  I was selling Percocets. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7154.56s)]
*  I'm going to become a realtor and really expand my empire. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7156.56s)]
*  Imagine a 19-year-old kid trying to sell your house. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7158.56s)]
*  I had a shaved head. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7160.56s)]
*  And I would come in and people would just be like, yeah, we're not going to use you. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7162.56s)]
*  And I'd cry in my car. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7164.56s)]
*  That's so fucking hard. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7166.56s)]
*  We're not going to use you? [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7168.56s)]
*  We're going to buy the house but we won't use you? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7170.56s)]
*  They would say they were going to use me and I'd be like, sweet, I'm about to make $4,000. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7172.56s)]
*  And I would take a credit card and max it out, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7174.56s)]
*  being like payday's coming, and then they'd be like, yeah, we're actually going with someone else. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7176.56s)]
*  And I'd be like, fuck, I'm fucking ruined. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7178.56s)]
*  Isn't that a dirty move in the real estate world? [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7180.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7182.56s)]
*  But what happens... [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7184.56s)]
*  When you're 19, you're like, yeah, whatever. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7186.56s)]
*  In real estate, what people do is they go, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7188.56s)]
*  what did the other guy say he can get you for your house? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7190.56s)]
*  And they'll go pie in the sky. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7192.56s)]
*  Because you'll just go, oh yeah, that sounds better, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7194.56s)]
*  but then they know it's not going to sell for that, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7196.56s)]
*  but they sign you into the contract. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7198.56s)]
*  And they slowly lower you down, which kind of fucks you. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7200.56s)]
*  Because that first week is kind of important. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7202.56s)]
*  If they see you've lowered the price, then they go, oh, they're open to negotiation. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7204.56s)]
*  Don't get me started, bro. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7206.56s)]
*  I'm a fucking certified fucking realtor. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7208.56s)]
*  You and Tim Dillon should do a podcast just on real estate. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7210.56s)]
*  Dude, I remember I was like, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7212.56s)]
*  I'm going to start being a grown-up and reading the newspaper [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7214.56s)]
*  and I open it up and it was like, subprime mortgage crisis. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7216.56s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck's that? [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7218.56s)]
*  That's Tim. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7220.56s)]
*  Was he a realtor too? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7222.56s)]
*  Oh, dude, he was all over that. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7224.56s)]
*  He was a subprime mortgage guy. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7226.56s)]
*  He fucked me. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7228.56s)]
*  Didn't Tim have houses that he was in? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7230.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7232.56s)]
*  Well, he had one house that got repossessed. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7234.56s)]
*  He bought it for like $600,000 when he was 21 years old, worth nothing. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7236.56s)]
*  And then they took it from him and then it sold for $250,000. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7242.56s)]
*  So it was like right after 2008, everything crashed. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7246.56s)]
*  He lost everything. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7250.56s)]
*  He's like, why the fuck did they sell me a house? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7252.56s)]
*  I mean, he's exactly right. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7254.56s)]
*  The way he describes the... [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7256.56s)]
*  We did a podcast together recently, his podcast, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7258.56s)]
*  that we filmed here, but the way he describes it, it's fucking... [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7260.56s)]
*  It was a good episode. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7262.56s)]
*  He goes, everybody's at fault. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7264.56s)]
*  You knew you couldn't fucking buy that house. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7266.56s)]
*  Like, why are you trying to buy that house when you don't have a job? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7268.56s)]
*  And they sold you the house, like, whoa, whoa, okay. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7270.56s)]
*  And then they took it from you. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7274.56s)]
*  And you're a victim? He's like, come on. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7276.56s)]
*  Fair's fair. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7278.56s)]
*  But that's looking at it one way. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7280.56s)]
*  Another way is looking at it like some family that scrapes together money [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7282.56s)]
*  and the bank convinces them this can work out. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7284.56s)]
*  And then their fucking rates go through the roof [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7286.56s)]
*  and then they can't afford their house anymore and now they're fucked. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7288.56s)]
*  Yeah, it is kind of a pos... [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7290.56s)]
*  Once the house is $400,000, even if you have good credit, [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7292.56s)]
*  you're like, how much am I going to pay him? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7294.56s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7296.56s)]
*  They're like, over 30 years you're going to pay $400,000 in interest. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7298.56s)]
*  You're like, whatever, man. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7300.56s)]
*  You crying in front of that real estate thing, [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7302.56s)]
*  that was one of our very close... [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7304.56s)]
*  Him sitting out there, he said he was crying after a deal didn't go through [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7306.56s)]
*  and a guy drove by on a bike and you're like, pussy. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7308.56s)]
*  No, that was when I... [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7310.56s)]
*  Why are you crying? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7312.56s)]
*  That was when I got divorced. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7314.56s)]
*  I used to go every day to my old... [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7316.56s)]
*  My house that I was living in when I was married [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7318.56s)]
*  and I'd walk the dog from my ex-wife [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7320.56s)]
*  because she was at work and I didn't... [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7322.56s)]
*  I didn't want to fuck her over. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7324.56s)]
*  I fucking love the dog, bro. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7326.56s)]
*  Fuck, man. I get choked up about that. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7328.56s)]
*  My wife knows it. She's like, how's the dog? [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7330.56s)]
*  I go, don't fucking bring that up, dude. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7332.56s)]
*  Chances are the citizen's going to reach that dog's ear. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7334.56s)]
*  The what? What you're saying right now. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7336.56s)]
*  She showed me a picture. Your dog's at home right now. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7338.56s)]
*  It's going to go. Don't, dude. Don't do it. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7340.56s)]
*  I used to drive. I would go there. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7342.56s)]
*  I'd walk the dog. I'd walk through the house [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7344.56s)]
*  and I'd be like, God, I'm a fucking piece of shit [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7346.56s)]
*  and I'd fuck. And I'd drive home and cry the whole way home. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7348.56s)]
*  And then I saw a guy jogging [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7350.56s)]
*  and I was crying in my car [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7352.56s)]
*  and I was like, pussy, out of the window. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7354.56s)]
*  I called him a pussy. I was trying to make myself feel better. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7356.56s)]
*  And he just looked at me like, what the fuck, dude? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7358.56s)]
*  We had the same sort of... [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7360.56s)]
*  Nice shorts, pussy. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7362.56s)]
*  I bombed at Helium. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7364.56s)]
*  I was driving back to our house [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7366.56s)]
*  and there was just a finance bro on a bike. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7368.56s)]
*  And I was just driving by him [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7370.56s)]
*  and I was like, pussy. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7372.56s)]
*  And I hit a red light [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7374.56s)]
*  and I saw him flying, dude. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7376.56s)]
*  For like a mile. I saw this dude pedaling [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7378.56s)]
*  to catch up to me. My windows were down. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7380.56s)]
*  And I had a thought. I was like, do I pull the window up? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7382.56s)]
*  I was like, no. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7384.56s)]
*  I get whatever he's about to give me. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7386.56s)]
*  I genuinely had that thought. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7388.56s)]
*  He deserves it. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7390.56s)]
*  He stuck his head in my window and he goes, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7392.56s)]
*  nice car, you fucking faggot. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7394.56s)]
*  And then I went... [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7396.56s)]
*  We both started laughing. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7398.56s)]
*  He pedaled away. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7400.56s)]
*  He laughed. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7402.56s)]
*  As soon as he hit me with what he said [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7404.56s)]
*  and I didn't react by like, yeah, right, I laughed. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7406.56s)]
*  When he said it, I was like, yo. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7408.56s)]
*  Dude. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7410.56s)]
*  I can't believe you said that. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7412.56s)]
*  He hit me with like a... [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7414.56s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7416.56s)]
*  That's a good exchange. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7418.56s)]
*  Yeah, like an aggressive exchange, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7420.56s)]
*  but you both walked away feeling good. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7422.56s)]
*  For no reason. I was just leaving helium. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7424.56s)]
*  I saw a guy on a bike and I was like, nice bike, [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7426.56s)]
*  fucking loser. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7428.56s)]
*  And he caught up. He goes, nice piece of shit car, [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7430.56s)]
*  you fucking... [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7432.56s)]
*  And he hit it. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7434.56s)]
*  We used to yell out of car windows constantly. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7436.56s)]
*  We used to live on Drexel's campus. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7438.56s)]
*  And it was back right when the woke stuff was starting. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7440.56s)]
*  It was the most fun shit in the world. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7442.56s)]
*  We'd leave open mics. I'd be drunk just sitting out of a car. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7444.56s)]
*  I'd go up to a light. There'd be college students. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7446.56s)]
*  I'd be like, excuse me, could you please check your privilege? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7448.56s)]
*  Could you please check your fucking privilege? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7450.56s)]
*  And be like... [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7452.56s)]
*  It was so fun. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7454.56s)]
*  The reactions were on. They would get pissed. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7456.56s)]
*  They would just use the fuck out of them. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7458.56s)]
*  Fuck you, dude. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7460.56s)]

*  who I guess is like this right-wing comedian. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7464.56s)]
*  He goes to one of these [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7466.56s)]
*  Ukraine protests [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7468.56s)]
*  and he brings a homeless guy [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7470.56s)]
*  and he says, my wife's boyfriend [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7472.56s)]
*  is homeless. Why don't you help him? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7474.56s)]
*  And the homeless people here. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7476.56s)]
*  And this guy legitimately tries to engage him. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7478.56s)]
*  Why are we sending all this money to Ukraine? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7480.56s)]
*  We have this homeless problem right here. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7482.56s)]
*  My wife's boyfriend is homeless. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7484.56s)]
*  And he's got this dude with his shirt off [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7486.56s)]
*  and he's shaking his cup [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7488.56s)]
*  with change in it. Come on, man. Give me some money. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7490.56s)]
*  We donate some money to him. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7492.56s)]
*  And the guy tries to engage about the problems [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7494.56s)]
*  with Ukraine and we have a legitimate [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7496.56s)]
*  problem with Ukraine. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7498.56s)]
*  What else do you do? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7500.56s)]
*  But this guy is like that liberal. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7502.56s)]
*  That liberal, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7504.56s)]
*  robot, zombie, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7506.56s)]
*  repeating shit that he saw on CNBC [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7508.56s)]
*  just saying it. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7510.56s)]
*  He's got no shot. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7512.56s)]
*  If somebody comes with a homeless dude [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7514.56s)]
*  and starts fucking with you. If they're a tag team [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7516.56s)]
*  you and a homeless dude [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7518.56s)]
*  roll up and start fucking with people. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7520.56s)]
*  It's just funny watching this guy trying to engage [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7522.56s)]
*  with these liberal Ukraine talking points. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7524.56s)]
*  Well, actually. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7526.56s)]
*  What Russia has done is [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7528.56s)]
*  this is it right here. Give me some volume on this. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7530.56s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7532.56s)]
*  Who would want America to send more money to Ukraine? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=7534.56s)]

*  And he keeps trying to finish the sentence. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8126.56s)]
*  How do they not have real time fact checking? [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8128.56s)]
*  Well, although they do, but now all of a sudden that's kind of weird. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8130.56s)]
*  True. Right, who does it? Snopes. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8132.56s)]
*  Exactly. No fact checks. The one guy and not the other guy. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8134.56s)]
*  And then you're sitting there going, wait, is that true? [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8136.56s)]
*  Well, a lot of things were fact checked [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8138.56s)]
*  during COVID that turned out to actually be true. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8140.56s)]
*  And they were fact checked as false. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8142.56s)]

*  the truth. Yeah. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8146.56s)]
*  But I'm saying if they get caught lying during the thing, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8148.56s)]
*  it should be like, no, that's actually false. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8150.56s)]
*  Yeah, but these independent fact checkers, [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8152.56s)]
*  it's very, a lot of the fact checks are [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8154.56s)]
*  very subjective, how they view the information. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8156.56s)]
*  Yeah. It's funny too, [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8158.56s)]

*  without even a horse. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=8894.56s)]

*  on wheels made out of wood. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9050.56s)]
*  With horses pulling you and you hope the horses stay alive. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9052.56s)]
*  Because you only got a few of them. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9054.56s)]
*  And a full family. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9056.56s)]
*  With kids. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9058.56s)]
*  And then you'd have a kid. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9060.56s)]
*  Your wife would get pregnant on the way. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9062.56s)]
*  Obviously. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9064.56s)]
*  I have a story about Ann Parker story. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9066.56s)]
*  The woman who was nine years old when her whole family [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9068.56s)]
*  was slaughtered. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9070.56s)]
*  They would take the young ones and integrate them into the tribe. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9072.56s)]
*  Because the Comanche lost a lot of [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9074.56s)]
*  children, a lot of mothers while they were pregnant. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9076.56s)]
*  The baby navy never came to term. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9078.56s)]
*  Because they were riding horses. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9080.56s)]
*  So they were bouncing around all the time. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9082.56s)]
*  A lot of impact. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9084.56s)]
*  So their populations, it was very important to keep [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9086.56s)]
*  a high population. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9088.56s)]
*  So they would bring in people that they captured. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9090.56s)]
*  That's what the Amish did. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9092.56s)]
*  I've heard. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9094.56s)]
*  They go on raiding. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9096.56s)]
*  They'll come down and raid us. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9098.56s)]
*  I've heard. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9100.56s)]
*  If they see a mom all drunk and fucked up. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9102.56s)]
*  I've heard. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9104.56s)]
*  I don't want to slur the Amish. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9106.56s)]
*  But I've heard they'll fucking snag it. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9108.56s)]
*  They need some new blood. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9110.56s)]
*  I've heard this. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9112.56s)]
*  My brother's boy. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9114.56s)]
*  It's a fun thing to say. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9116.56s)]
*  It's like folklore. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9118.56s)]
*  It's nice having the Amish. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9120.56s)]
*  That's what separated us growing up. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9122.56s)]
*  You where you lived, Amish country, me. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9124.56s)]
*  What's that thing they get to do? [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9126.56s)]
*  Rumspringen. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9128.56s)]
*  They get to stay on Rumspringen as long as they want. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9130.56s)]
*  And then they can come back. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9132.56s)]
*  It's not like a year. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9134.56s)]
*  It's as long as they want. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9136.56s)]
*  You can be 38 and be like, alright, Rumspringen is done. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9138.56s)]
*  But your parents will shun you. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9140.56s)]
*  They can't talk to you. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9142.56s)]
*  You can get shunned real hard. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9144.56s)]
*  If you fuck up real bad, everyone you know [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9146.56s)]
*  just won't talk to you. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9148.56s)]
*  They don't have phones. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9150.56s)]
*  How do they even know if you're upset? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9152.56s)]
*  Old school accusations. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9154.56s)]
*  Just like, dude, he smells like booze. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9156.56s)]
*  Or if you go like, alright, mom. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9158.56s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9160.56s)]
*  How do you even know if they're mad at you? [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9162.56s)]
*  You're not around them. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9164.56s)]
*  That's a big thing in the Amish community. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9166.56s)]
*  But what I'm saying is how do they know [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9168.56s)]
*  the parents are mad if they're out running around [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9170.56s)]
*  because the parents don't have phones. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9172.56s)]
*  So they can't call you. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9174.56s)]
*  He's saying when you get back, [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9176.56s)]
*  if you fuck up within the community, you will get shunned. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9178.56s)]
*  Yeah, everyone will stop talking to you. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9180.56s)]
*  It's like a punishment they do. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9182.56s)]
*  For how long? I don't know. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9184.56s)]

*  No, then I wanted to so badly today. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9274.56s)]
*  That's the final frontier. Not looking at the porn in the hotel room is tough. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9276.56s)]
*  It's impossible. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9278.56s)]
*  Only I'll know, but I can't. I can't do it. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9280.56s)]
*  If I do it, I'll tell people. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9282.56s)]
*  That's the thing, though. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9284.56s)]
*  But you can't get caught. You said your worry was that you were going to get caught. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9286.56s)]
*  Yeah, but I've also been a big harto about being like, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9288.56s)]
*  I quit porn. I've said it in public. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9290.56s)]
*  So now if I go back on it, I'm going to get crushed. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9292.56s)]
*  You're a prisoner to your statements. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9294.56s)]
*  Yeah, but also it's not bad. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9296.56s)]
*  Once you stop it, it is easy. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9298.56s)]
*  I don't need it. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9300.56s)]
*  I think he does. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9302.56s)]
*  He keeps talking to me about this. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9304.56s)]
*  And every time I'm like, [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9306.56s)]
*  who cares? [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9308.56s)]
*  It's a mental challenge. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9310.56s)]
*  I genuinely don't think about it. [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9312.56s)]
*  Or care about it. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9314.56s)]
*  But some dudes get addicted to it. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9316.56s)]
*  I don't watch porn when we're together. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9318.56s)]
*  I was home the last two weeks. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9320.56s)]
*  I didn't whack off once to porn. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9322.56s)]
*  As soon as I got to this hotel in Austin, [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9324.56s)]
*  I was like, [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9326.56s)]
*  it was time. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9328.56s)]
*  You forget how good porn is, dude. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9330.56s)]
*  You look at it, you're like, yo! [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9332.56s)]
*  What is she? She got stuck. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9334.56s)]
*  She's stuck in the dryer. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9336.56s)]
*  That shit rules. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9338.56s)]
*  You forget, dude. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9340.56s)]
*  How many girls get stuck under the bed looking for an earring? [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9342.56s)]
*  Dude, it's not a moral grandstand. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9344.56s)]
*  I want to build my willpower. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9346.56s)]
*  My willpower is weak. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9348.56s)]
*  You quit selling drugs and you quit watching porn. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9350.56s)]
*  You have good willpower. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9354.56s)]
*  You have great willpower. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9356.56s)]
*  It took a while. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9358.56s)]
*  And also it took some bad events. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9360.56s)]
*  But you did quit. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9362.56s)]
*  Also, he's discussed what type of pern he's into. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9364.56s)]
*  What kind? [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9366.56s)]
*  I was just into everything, brother. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9368.56s)]
*  I went down some dark alleys. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9370.56s)]
*  What's the darkest? [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9372.56s)]
*  The tees? [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9374.56s)]
*  The fucking T100s. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9376.56s)]
*  T100s? What's that? [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9378.56s)]
*  What's the term there? T1000s? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9380.56s)]
*  He ran into some T1000s. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9382.56s)]
*  Boys and the girls. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9384.56s)]
*  When the boys become girls and the boys... [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9386.56s)]
*  Oh, the tees. Trans. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9388.56s)]
*  He liked the tees. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9390.56s)]
*  That could be an issue. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9392.56s)]
*  I'll tell you, it is. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9394.56s)]
*  It's just a ramping up of like, [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9396.56s)]
*  talking about super normal stimuli, [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9398.56s)]
*  that's why I'm so passionate about that. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9400.56s)]
*  I mean, you need the edge. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9402.56s)]
*  This was my problem with it. I didn't have a drug problem. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9404.56s)]
*  I could never stop drugs or whatever. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9406.56s)]
*  But then you get the blood flowing on sex stuff. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9408.56s)]
*  That's not getting it flowing. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9410.56s)]
*  You go to something a little bit more out there. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9412.56s)]
*  Then you finally land on those shores [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9414.56s)]
*  and you go, my god. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9416.56s)]
*  My god, where have I gone? [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9418.56s)]
*  You try to assemble the raft, it's all fucked up. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9420.56s)]
*  One of our first episodes [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9422.56s)]
*  is he's explaining, he watches it. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9424.56s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9426.56s)]
*  And then he was like, give it a shot. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9428.56s)]
*  I tried to whack off the teeporn. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9430.56s)]
*  I opened it. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9432.56s)]
*  First thing, I'm watching a dude, you can see his clavicles [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9434.56s)]
*  while he's fucking, or her. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9436.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? You could see the clavicle. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9438.56s)]
*  I was just like, ew, dude. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9440.56s)]
*  I turned it off immediately. I can't believe how- [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9442.56s)]
*  I have a strong imagination. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9444.56s)]
*  I have a strong imagination. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9446.56s)]
*  I saw one fucking dude on top with tits, [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9448.56s)]
*  but you could still see the clavicle [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9450.56s)]
*  and the Adam's apple. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9452.56s)]
*  You sought that out, dude. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9454.56s)]
*  I don't know which one's to search. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9456.56s)]
*  I know, I'm fucking around. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9458.56s)]
*  But, I will say, dude, I'm telling you, [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9460.56s)]
*  it's a silent epidemic, dude. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9462.56s)]
*  I'm not projecting this on the masses. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9464.56s)]
*  I believe so. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9466.56s)]
*  I truly believe so. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9468.56s)]
*  Actually, no, if you read the book, [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9470.56s)]
*  what is it, fucking, [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9472.56s)]
*  A Billion Wicked Lies, A Billion Wicked Thoughts? [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9474.56s)]
*  They crunch the fucking metadata from the internet [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9476.56s)]
*  and it's like, [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9478.56s)]
*  it's due in numbers, dude. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9480.56s)]
*  Someone's crunching the metadata on trans porn? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9482.56s)]
*  On all porn. All porn, dude. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9484.56s)]
*  And what's fucked up is the porn- [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9486.56s)]
*  That sounds like one of those Pfizer studies. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9488.56s)]
*  They're trying to find the right result. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9490.56s)]
*  Matt, please stop acting serious right now. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9492.56s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9494.56s)]
*  You're pretending to be serious about this. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9496.56s)]
*  He's crunching metadata with a pen in his hand. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9498.56s)]

*  and he's fucking hovering it over the paper. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9502.56s)]
*  He's talking about metadata on T-Porn. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9504.56s)]
*  He's waited so long to be on this show [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9506.56s)]
*  and now he's here and he's like, [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9508.56s)]
*  I'm telling you, they crunched numbers on T-Porn, dude. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9510.56s)]
*  We didn't have to bring this up. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9512.56s)]
*  I like it. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9514.56s)]

*  You go off of it, you kind of de-escalate [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9540.56s)]
*  the fucking dopaminergic drive towards more and more of crazy. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9542.56s)]
*  And then you go, yeah, I'm cool in that. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9546.56s)]

*  in his apartment playing Madden on the easiest level, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9678.56s)]
*  running up the score. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9680.56s)]
*  Against the computer. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9682.56s)]

*  Most of the traffic was cabs. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9856.56s)]
*  And now, you drive around. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9858.56s)]
*  What a weird system, right? We'll drive you. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9860.56s)]
*  You don't need to drive. Just get in. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9862.56s)]
*  Tell me where you're going. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9864.56s)]
*  Yeah, Philly made Uber pay them $250,000 a year. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9866.56s)]
*  They sell, they call them taxi medallions. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9868.56s)]
*  You have to buy a license. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9870.56s)]
*  And the license were worth a lot of money. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9872.56s)]
*  And then, once Uber came in, [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9874.56s)]
*  it was like a liquor license, but for driving taxi cabs. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9876.56s)]
*  And they just plummeted. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9878.56s)]
*  They're almost worthless now. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9880.56s)]
*  Philadelphia Parking Authority owns the cabs. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9882.56s)]
*  And they're like, you got to pay us $250,000. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9884.56s)]
*  You don't like them, do you? [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9886.56s)]
*  Uber? [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9888.56s)]
*  Uber's fine. Philadelphia Parking Authority. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9890.56s)]
*  PPA. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9892.56s)]
*  They'll just come snag your car. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9894.56s)]
*  They double-invalidate. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9896.56s)]
*  It's really fucked up. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9898.56s)]
*  And they just sell your car. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9900.56s)]
*  And then, they charge you money. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9902.56s)]
*  I've gotten two cars taken. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9904.56s)]
*  They're like $500 cars. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9906.56s)]
*  They're $500 cars. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9908.56s)]
*  They would take them, and I would just go, [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9910.56s)]
*  fuck you guys. One time I went back, [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9912.56s)]
*  because you had to write, like, what, [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9914.56s)]
*  you could go get your valuables out of your car [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9916.56s)]
*  before they sold it at auction. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9918.56s)]
*  So I went back, and you had to fill out a piece of paper [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9920.56s)]
*  of what was in there, and I put like a giant dildo. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9922.56s)]
*  And I put all this stuff, and they had to take it back to their guy [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9924.56s)]
*  and have it written off on it. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9926.56s)]
*  Nice, you got them. Pretty tight. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9928.56s)]
*  Suck our dicks, PPA. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9930.56s)]
*  Yeah, but they'll take your shit and just repossess it. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9932.56s)]
*  What happens before they take your car? [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9934.56s)]
*  Now it's like two or three, dude. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9936.56s)]
*  So you have a BMW. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9938.56s)]
*  You got a new BMW. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9940.56s)]
*  You get two or three tickets you don't pay, [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9942.56s)]
*  and they put a boot on you and they take your car. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9944.56s)]
*  And then they charge you every day they have it. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9946.56s)]
*  And then you can go back and basically buy it. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9948.56s)]
*  You can pay them. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9950.56s)]
*  They hold it like hostage, and you can pay them to take the boot off, [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9952.56s)]
*  and they won't tow it. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9954.56s)]
*  But if you're late, they'll tow it, [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9956.56s)]
*  and then you gotta go down to a lot. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9958.56s)]
*  You gotta call a bunch of people, like, figure out where your car is, [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9960.56s)]
*  and they give it back to you. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9962.56s)]
*  Now if you don't pay it back in time, then they sell it off at auction. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9964.56s)]
*  They get a ton of money doing it. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9966.56s)]
*  And they can also do a thing where [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9968.56s)]
*  they've taken my dad's car with my brother-owned money. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9970.56s)]
*  Because they had the same name. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9972.56s)]
*  And they're just like, sorry, dude, is what it is. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9974.56s)]
*  You gotta pay us and come get your car. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9976.56s)]
*  Dude, it's criminal. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9978.56s)]
*  Even if it's not your car? [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9980.56s)]
*  Your kid's car? [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9982.56s)]
*  But they both have the same first name. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9984.56s)]
*  So they're like, oh, it was a mistake, but you still gotta pay. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9986.56s)]
*  And it's like, you know, fucking... [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9988.56s)]
*  You can't, there's nobody you can talk to. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9990.56s)]
*  It's the Wizard of Oz. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9992.56s)]
*  You go up to blacked out glass and just talk to a lady [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9994.56s)]
*  who's just like, three hundred six, five bucks. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9996.56s)]
*  Dude, I got my car towed when we were filming [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=9998.56s)]
*  Gillian Keyes. I was supposed to be on set. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10000.56s)]
*  I walked to my car in the morning, car's gone. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10002.56s)]
*  Go out there, it is... [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10004.56s)]
*  I had to go to like a dock. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10006.56s)]
*  The car was just behind like an old warehouse. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10008.56s)]
*  I had to talk to the... [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10010.56s)]
*  Behind the glass, there was just a black lady. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10012.56s)]
*  I was like, hey, where's my car? She was like, get out! [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10014.56s)]
*  She was like screaming at me. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10016.56s)]
*  It's crazy. It's crazy, man. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10018.56s)]
*  I thought that story I was gonna tell would be better. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10020.56s)]
*  No, when you go down there, it's like a barbed-wired [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10022.56s)]
*  fucking fence and you go in and there's just [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10024.56s)]
*  someone's mean as fuck. It's like a... [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10026.56s)]
*  It's crazy the way they do it. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10028.56s)]
*  And then they control all the parking in the city. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10030.56s)]
*  They set up, you know, all this stuff. It's... [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10032.56s)]
*  They're bad. And apparently, from what I've heard, [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10034.56s)]
*  the money doesn't even go [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10036.56s)]
*  to the city of Philadelphia. It's actually... [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10038.56s)]
*  It goes to like some GOP... [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10040.56s)]
*  Like it goes to the state, weirdly. Or part of it goes to the state. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10042.56s)]
*  If you try to look up the PPA, [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10044.56s)]
*  they say it's a quasi-governmental agency. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10046.56s)]
*  So like, we try to follow where their money goes. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10048.56s)]
*  It's kind of really hard to figure out. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10050.56s)]
*  Should we Google this or should we just take a look at it? [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10052.56s)]
*  Look it up. Yeah, look it up again. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10054.56s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like that one we might want to substantiate. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10056.56s)]
*  Yeah, true. I'm wrong, I'm wrong. But fuck them anyway. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10058.56s)]

*  She had two? Why'd she have two? [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10076.56s)]
*  I had no idea. You guys got matching Camrys. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10078.56s)]
*  Matching Camrys, bro. 88 Camrys were buzzing around. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10080.56s)]
*  This is the same old lady that got crushed by Vince McMahon? [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10082.56s)]
*  That was probably her baby. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10086.56s)]
*  That was you and your brother. You and your brother powerbombed her. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10088.56s)]
*  The fucking lady went down hard, bro. [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10090.56s)]
*  That can't be good. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10092.56s)]
*  When you get a ticket from the PPA or any of that, [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10094.56s)]
*  when you're fucking, like, [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10096.56s)]

*  You tell me that's going to those schools in Philly? [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10151.56s)]
*  Look at the Inquirer. Overpays executives and that's too many political... [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10153.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10156.56s)]
*  Exactly. Oh, it turns out the PPA's website might not be telling the total fucking story. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10158.56s)]
*  Let's see what it says. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10162.56s)]
*  Fuck the PPA, Matt. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10164.56s)]
*  I can't stand them. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10166.56s)]
*  Someone takes your 88 camera, dude. You'll be fucking salty. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10168.56s)]
*  Yeah, you're never going to let it go. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10171.56s)]
*  You're going to wait until you get on the highest platform on earth and go, [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10173.56s)]
*  fucking pieces of shit. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10175.56s)]
*  When you get incentivized to have that much revenue coming in every year, [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10177.56s)]
*  would if nobody parked bad ever again? [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10181.56s)]
*  Would if everybody did the right thing, everybody paid the meter, [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10184.56s)]
*  and all that $264 million dried up? [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10187.56s)]
*  What the fuck do they do now? [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10189.56s)]
*  That's the problem. There's an incentive to catch people. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10191.56s)]
*  I can't even read those signs. Anytime I try to park, it's like Monday through Friday. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10195.56s)]
*  They go over those things with a thousand grits handbooked. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10198.56s)]
*  They also will get you for inspection. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10201.56s)]
*  If your inspection's up, they'll take you every single day. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10204.56s)]
*  Really? [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10206.56s)]
*  Wow. Motherfuckers. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10208.56s)]
*  But they had a problem. One time there was a gap in what they were supposed to pay the schools, [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10210.56s)]
*  and they had to be like, oh, oh, oh. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10214.56s)]
*  So what does it say here? [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10216.56s)]
*  2007, Parents United, a Philadelphia parent group that fights for school reforms, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10218.56s)]
*  successfully sued the PPA for failing to pay the city and school district under its 2004 obligations. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10221.56s)]
*  During these years, the PPA was technically in breach of its agreement with the state [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10227.56s)]
*  and greedily withheld money that it owed. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10231.56s)]
*  Greedy PPA, dude. [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10234.56s)]
*  Tell him to man. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10236.56s)]
*  I like how it says greedily. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10237.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty, yeah. [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10239.56s)]
*  But either way, I mean, I'll stop talking about that. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10241.56s)]
*  I like it. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10245.56s)]
*  It's all right, dude. I like when people are mad. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10246.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty funny. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10248.56s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10249.56s)]
*  Especially against parking tickets. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10250.56s)]
*  Especially the truth. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10251.56s)]
*  Well, it is a fucking gross thing when you're poor. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10252.56s)]
*  You can't even just leave your car somewhere. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10254.56s)]
*  This guy followed me to Sheetz in my Corolla, and he got me. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10257.56s)]
*  At the gas station, he stayed and ran my plate just because I was driving a poor person car. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10262.56s)]
*  And he followed me out of the gas station and then pulled me over. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10267.56s)]
*  It was like, your registration's expired. All this stuff's expired. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10270.56s)]
*  Looking at it, it was me and I was with a dog. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10273.56s)]
*  A dog was in shotgun. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10275.56s)]
*  And I was like, this ruins me. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10277.56s)]
*  I was like, I'm literally, I have zero dollars. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10279.56s)]
*  You give me a $180 ticket. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10281.56s)]
*  You tell him that? [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10283.56s)]
*  I don't fuck. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10284.56s)]
*  I mean, I was kind of like, are you serious? [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10285.56s)]
*  Are you serious about this? [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10287.56s)]
*  Like, I'll go get it, please. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10288.56s)]
*  It was my inspection. He was like, nah, yeah. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10290.56s)]
*  He was young, too. He was like my age. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10292.56s)]
*  That's what their job is, though. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10294.56s)]
*  No, I know. I wasn't mad at. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10295.56s)]
*  I mean, I was mad at him just because I had zero dollars. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10297.56s)]
*  What the fuck does they have quotas? [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10299.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10301.56s)]
*  And cops have quotas for pulling people over in certain places. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10302.56s)]
*  And it's kind of unspoken. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10305.56s)]
*  It's not written on paper in some places because it's not technically legal. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10307.56s)]
*  But I've talked to a lot of cops. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10311.56s)]
*  You have to make a certain amount of revenue. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10313.56s)]
*  You're basically a glorified revenue collector. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10315.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10318.56s)]
*  Pulling people over and making money for the state. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10319.56s)]
*  You're not stopping any fucking real crimes. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10321.56s)]
*  No. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10323.56s)]
*  Doing that. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10324.56s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10325.56s)]
*  And they call it activity. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10326.56s)]
*  They'll be like, you're low in activity. [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10327.56s)]
*  We need some activity. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10329.56s)]
*  What if everybody followed the rules? [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10331.56s)]
*  Imagine that. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10333.56s)]
*  What if? [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10334.56s)]
*  I mean, would they still keep cops around like they have a fireman? [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10335.56s)]
*  For sure. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10338.56s)]
*  They have to have a fireman. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10339.56s)]
*  You know, because if fire can break out, you might not have a fire for five years. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10341.56s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10344.56s)]
*  Disband the fire department? [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10345.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10347.56s)]
*  Yeah, they'll be here. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10348.56s)]
*  And you didn't eat them, but yeah, the speed trap stuff. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10349.56s)]
*  Of course. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10351.56s)]
*  I like the bros. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10352.56s)]
*  I do. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10353.56s)]
*  Obviously, we support the blue. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10354.56s)]
*  Yeah, I've come around on those guys. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10355.56s)]
*  I like them, man. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10357.56s)]
*  I almost now, I'm looking forward to getting pulled over so I can talk shop with them guys. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10358.56s)]
*  I mean, now that I can afford a ticket, you got me. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10362.56s)]
*  Good stuff. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10365.56s)]
*  I love what you guys are doing. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10366.56s)]
*  I was just trying to get your attention. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10367.56s)]
*  You know what's fucked is those cameras. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10368.56s)]
*  They were catching people running red lights and giving them tickets. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10370.56s)]
*  And it turns out the money wasn't even, it was like a privately owned company. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10374.56s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10377.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10378.56s)]
*  Those were not real tickets. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10379.56s)]
*  It's like the PPA. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10380.56s)]
*  PPA owns that too, by the way. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10381.56s)]
*  But that got overturned. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10382.56s)]
*  They can't do that anymore. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10384.56s)]
*  They were shortening the yellow ones. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10385.56s)]
*  Because people fought it. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10386.56s)]
*  Were they really? [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10387.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10388.56s)]
*  New Jersey got busted for shortening the yellow lights and snagging people at those things. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10389.56s)]
*  What? [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10393.56s)]
*  By how much? [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10394.56s)]
*  Like a second or something. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10395.56s)]
*  It was enough to snag you. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10396.56s)]
*  Because you know, you're like, oh, I got the, and it snags you. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10397.56s)]
*  Yeah, you got enough time. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10398.56s)]
*  Go for it. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10399.56s)]
*  Man, what's worse than when you're driving and you see a flash. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10400.56s)]
*  I didn't even know they were doing it. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10403.56s)]
*  In Maryland, they do it a ton where the speed limits are checked by speed cameras. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10404.56s)]
*  Yep. [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10407.56s)]
*  I'd be driving to shows, open mics and shit. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10408.56s)]
*  Again, zero dollars. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10410.56s)]
*  I'd be driving, dude, a flash would be in the car. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10411.56s)]
*  I'd be like, shit. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10414.56s)]
*  I'd be like, I'm gonna cry. [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10416.56s)]
*  Because they know what, back then it goes to your parents address too. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10417.56s)]
*  It's going to my mom's. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10420.56s)]
*  It's my mom's car. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10421.56s)]
*  You know they got you. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10422.56s)]

*  Oh. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10629.56s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10630.56s)]
*  Yeah, dude, even just driving like a truck with a trailer of like lawnmowers on the back, [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10632.56s)]
*  you try to stop that thing like 60 miles an hour, it just doesn't stop. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10636.56s)]
*  Go to Richard Wrong's Instagram page, and he's got a reel up of this dude who's revving up this truck engine, [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10639.56s)]
*  this gigantic souped up truck engine, and it fucking blows up like he got hit by a missile. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10646.56s)]
*  It's wild. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10651.56s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10652.56s)]
*  Because it's a 3,000 horsepower souped up engine, and they're like, [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10653.56s)]
*  and then boom. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10659.56s)]
*  There he is. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10661.56s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10662.56s)]
*  Fuck, where is it? [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10665.56s)]
*  Go to his reels? [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10666.56s)]
*  That's a nice pic. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10668.56s)]
*  Damn, dude. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10672.56s)]
*  I think that's it, the one, that one right there. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10673.56s)]
*  This was not. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10675.56s)]
*  Nope, that's not it. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10677.56s)]
*  That's not it. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10678.56s)]
*  Maybe someone took it down. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10679.56s)]
*  No, did they take it down? [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10681.56s)]
*  That looks like it. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10683.56s)]
*  Where? [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10684.56s)]
*  No, you just see the truck. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10685.56s)]
*  The back of that thing just exploded. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10686.56s)]
*  No, you just see the truck. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10687.56s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10688.56s)]
*  There's a fucking thing on fire. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10689.56s)]
*  That's just an engine. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10690.56s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10691.56s)]
*  No, that's not it. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10692.56s)]
*  It was way worse than that. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10693.56s)]
*  Let's see if I can find it. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10694.56s)]
*  I can find it, Jamie, and I'll send it to you. [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10695.56s)]
*  Well, whatever this guy's doing. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10697.56s)]
*  Also, what happened, I guess I could just look for it too. [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10699.56s)]
*  You said a truck exploded something? [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10702.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10703.56s)]
*  Truck burnout explosion? [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10704.56s)]
*  I'm such a pussy. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10705.56s)]
*  I don't know anything about cars. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10706.56s)]
*  I don't know anything about anything, dude. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10707.56s)]
*  I really don't. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10709.56s)]
*  That really blows. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10710.56s)]
*  Tell you what, though, I know about crunching the metadata. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10711.56s)]
*  Crunching the metadata on Seagull's thing. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10713.56s)]
*  No, that's not it. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10715.56s)]
*  Here we go. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10716.56s)]
*  That's what happens though. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10717.56s)]
*  The tire burns out. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10718.56s)]
*  No, this is way worse. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10719.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10720.56s)]
*  Maybe, was it his YouTube? [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10721.56s)]
*  Does Rawlings have a YouTube? [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10724.56s)]
*  Did he put it on there? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10726.56s)]
*  I don't know, but I don't think he does. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10727.56s)]
*  See that there, because maybe they removed it for some reason, [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10728.56s)]
*  because maybe someone died. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10731.56s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10732.56s)]
*  Because it looked like people died. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10733.56s)]
*  Oh, that's not good. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10734.56s)]
*  It looks like people died. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10737.56s)]
*  Someone died. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10738.56s)]
*  Richard Rawlings balled. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10739.56s)]
*  What? [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10740.56s)]
*  It looked like easily someone could have died. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10741.56s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10744.56s)]
*  That's not the kind of content you see on YouTube. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10745.56s)]
*  You ever see those fucking speed boats? [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10746.56s)]
*  Just click on videos instead of home? [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10747.56s)]
*  Now click on shorts. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10749.56s)]
*  Click on shorts. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10753.56s)]
*  No, I don't see it. [[02:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10754.56s)]
*  So Google 3000 horsepower truck engine explodes. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10757.56s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10762.56s)]
*  Fuck, I should have saved it. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10764.56s)]
*  I was going to repost it, but it might have been that somebody died. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10765.56s)]
*  Yeah, it might have taken it down. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10768.56s)]
*  Because it was fucking wild. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10770.56s)]
*  Wild. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10772.56s)]
*  They just revenue. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10773.56s)]
*  Boom. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10774.56s)]
*  I mean, giant fireball. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10777.56s)]
*  This dude dies out of the front seat. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10779.56s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10781.56s)]
*  There's a bunch of people hanging around. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10782.56s)]
*  This seems like a famous video from a couple years ago. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10783.56s)]
*  Isn't it funny that like 2000. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10789.56s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10791.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10792.56s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10793.56s)]
*  That's it right here. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10794.56s)]
*  So they're revving this up. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10795.56s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10796.56s)]
*  Bro. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10797.56s)]
*  Get some volume, though, because you've got to hear it, because it's fucking bananas. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10798.56s)]
*  Oh, no, bro. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10801.56s)]
*  Look at that dude bail out of the front. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10812.56s)]
*  That's monster energy drinks. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10816.56s)]
*  3000 horsepower dyno explosion. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10823.56s)]
*  So they were testing the horsepower on a dyno and the fucking engine blew. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10826.56s)]
*  Bro. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10830.56s)]
*  Jamie, add a comment. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10832.56s)]
*  Sick. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10833.56s)]
*  From the Joe Rogan experience. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10834.56s)]

*  Something Beavis and Butthead. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10839.56s)]
*  The guy had gage earrings. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10842.56s)]
*  He was just in there just. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10845.56s)]
*  Did you watch any of the Beavis and Butthead, the new Beavis and Butthead? [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10848.56s)]
*  No. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10851.56s)]
*  No. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10852.56s)]
*  Is that any good, Jamie? [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10853.56s)]
*  I watched some of it. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10854.56s)]
*  I haven't watched the TV shows. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10855.56s)]
*  They brought the show back, too. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10856.56s)]
*  Right. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10857.56s)]
*  I haven't watched those. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10858.56s)]
*  I watched some of the movies. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10859.56s)]
*  They brought the show back? [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10860.56s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10861.56s)]
*  It's on Paramount Plus, I think. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10862.56s)]
*  What? [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10863.56s)]
*  How do you think it is? [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10864.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10865.56s)]
*  I have a feeling they stunk it up. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10866.56s)]
*  I don't know why. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10867.56s)]
*  If they watch TikTok videos, that could be funny. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10868.56s)]
*  I got a feeling they stunk it up, too. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10869.56s)]
*  How many people watch Paramount Plus? [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10870.56s)]
*  Is it 20? [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10871.56s)]
*  Probably. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10872.56s)]
*  No, I think P+. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10873.56s)]
*  Didn't they have South Park? [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10874.56s)]
*  Actually, I watched South Park and I deleted my account. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10875.56s)]
*  No, they had the South Park special on there. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10876.56s)]
*  I watched that and then deleted that. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10877.56s)]
*  Now HBO Max has South Park. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10879.56s)]
*  Okay, nice. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10882.56s)]
*  But there's so many streaming platforms, though. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=10883.56s)]

*  No, shit. [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11384.52s)]
*  Where'd he take you? [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11385.52s)]
*  Fucking local shitholes in Pennsylvania and Jersey. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11386.52s)]

*  He'd always be like, lose my number, kids. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11393.52s)]
*  He was so fucking funny. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11394.52s)]
*  But getting friends with a real legit comic like that when you're just starting out. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11395.52s)]
*  It was so huge. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11399.52s)]
*  And then when I was getting SNL, Voss came up and was like, you know I've always been [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11400.52s)]

*  He's great. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11412.52s)]
*  But that's like that moment when a guy like that takes you on the road. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11413.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11416.52s)]

*  Very funny. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11433.52s)]
*  He's somehow underrated. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11434.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11435.52s)]
*  For how good he is. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11436.52s)]

*  It's one of those, you know, it happened with you. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11441.52s)]
*  It's happening right now with Hinchcliffe. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11443.92s)]
*  Hinchcliffe is selling out everywhere. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11445.36s)]
*  He's crushing it. [[03:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11446.36s)]
*  Dude, Tony does crush. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11447.36s)]
*  He's, fuck, he's an animal, dude. [[03:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11448.36s)]
*  His standup is good. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11451.16s)]
*  Well, that's because his character, he's a very unlikable person, his character. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11452.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11456.24s)]

*  I love this fucking guy. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11461.24s)]
*  He just loves pro wrestling. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11462.24s)]
*  Maybe you watch him on stage and he's such a cocksucker the whole time. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11463.24s)]
*  He wants to be the heel. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11466.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11467.24s)]
*  He wants to be the pro wrestling heel. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11468.24s)]
*  And then he kills. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11469.24s)]
*  But he's got it down to a science. [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11470.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11471.24s)]

*  Yeah. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11473.24s)]
*  Going on the road, man, dude, fucking, that is the greatest education a comic ever gets. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11474.24s)]
*  When you're first starting out and you get to go on the road. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11479.16s)]

*  I used to love airports. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11514.24s)]
*  I'd go to an airport and be like, dude, this is going to be so sick. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11515.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11517.24s)]

*  acts. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11523.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11524.4s)]
*  I brought guys that I knew that were really funny, that were cool. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11525.4s)]
*  I paid them. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11527.36s)]
*  I just, I would get them, I would, instead of like the club paying them because they [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11528.36s)]
*  always underpay you, I would pay them. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11531.44s)]
*  I'll pay for everybody. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11533.04s)]
*  I'd pay for their tickets, pay for their hotel. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11534.04s)]
*  I just, and everybody's like, well, it costs money to fly people out. [[03:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11536.04s)]
*  You could just get the local. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11539.44s)]
*  I go, yeah, yeah, but that's not an option. [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11540.44s)]
*  In my mind, like that, then it's depression weekend. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11542.800000000001s)]
*  Then it's me alone in a Phoenix hotel room staring at the TV, flipping channels, deciding [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11545.76s)]
*  whether or not I want to work out now. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11551.880000000001s)]

*  And then my only interaction with people is at the club. [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11554.720000000001s)]
*  See, don't talk for a full day. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11558.08s)]
*  For the full day. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11559.6s)]
*  Until the first thing you say is, hey everybody. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11560.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11562.64s)]
*  Richie Jenney talked about that once. [[03:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11564.039999999999s)]
*  Sometimes the first words he would say to anybody all day would be on stage. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11565.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11569.56s)]
*  Like that's crazy. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11570.56s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of don't mind that though. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11571.56s)]
*  I can wander around by myself for a while. [[03:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11572.56s)]
*  Yeah? [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11574.68s)]
*  You don't get depressed? [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11575.68s)]
*  No, I kind of enjoy it. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11576.68s)]
*  I can sit by myself for a long time. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11577.68s)]
*  I can for a day. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11580.24s)]
*  I like a day off. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11581.24s)]
*  When you're on week number eight. [[03:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11582.24s)]
*  See, that'll fuck me up. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11584.24s)]
*  Week number eight. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11585.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[03:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11586.24s)]
*  When you travel with your boys. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11587.4s)]
*  See, yeah, that's fun. [[03:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11588.4s)]
*  When you travel with your boys, you go on a dinner with your friends. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11589.4s)]
*  It's like this. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11591.36s)]
*  True, true, true. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11592.36s)]
*  Like us right now, having a... [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11593.36s)]
*  If we were on the road, we would have the same conversation while we're eating steak. [[03:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11594.36s)]
*  Like, ha ha ha. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11597.0s)]
*  True. [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11598.0s)]
*  Laughing, having fun, cracking a bottle of wine. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11599.0s)]
*  Shows in an hour, let's go boys, let's go. [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11602.64s)]
*  And then you go. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11604.76s)]
*  It's fucking, it's the best. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11605.76s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing them sparingly. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11606.76s)]
*  So I'd be like, oh, this is a nice little quiet weekend. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11607.76s)]
*  But yeah, if that was like week after week after week after week, that would get kind [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11610.08s)]
*  of isolated. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11613.52s)]
*  I'm with you like sparingly. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11614.52s)]
*  A nice week by yourself does rule. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11615.52s)]
*  But yeah, you got to bring the bros. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11617.76s)]
*  And when you're on the road with your boys, it's like they're your family. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11618.76s)]
*  It's like we're all just friends. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11622.52s)]
*  This is a great time. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11624.36s)]
*  We're all having a good time together. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11625.36s)]
*  Everyone's having a good time. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11626.36s)]
*  Unless someone bombs. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11627.36s)]
*  The one guy that bombs. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11628.36s)]
*  But then that's kind of fun, dude. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11631.36s)]
*  I love when one of my friends bombs, dude. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11633.0s)]
*  You got to go, yo, what the fuck was that? [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11635.0s)]
*  Right, but if you're taking guys, like you're giving them a chance, and you realize like [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11638.0s)]
*  halfway into the weekend, like this is not going to work out. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11641.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11645.0s)]
*  You just keep bringing them. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11646.0s)]
*  Do you? [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11647.0s)]
*  I do. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11648.0s)]
*  I got guys on the roster that will bomb. [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11649.0s)]
*  No problem. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11652.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll put those dudes up on a regular night and give them a shot, but not on the [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11654.0s)]
*  road. [[03:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11658.0s)]
*  When you're on the road, I'm bringing heavy hitters. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11659.0s)]
*  I'm bringing Bryan Simpson, Hinchcliffe, and Hans, and I'm bringing killers. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11660.0s)]
*  But the fun part is still like I remember being excited being at the airport. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11664.0s)]
*  It was literally three years ago. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11669.0s)]
*  Right. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11671.0s)]
*  You were a pro. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11672.0s)]
*  I get to take like LaMare and like Nate and all these guys that like they get to the airport [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11673.0s)]
*  and they're like, yo, this is fucking crazy. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11677.0s)]
*  Dude, they have this at the airport? [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11679.0s)]
*  They've never flown. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11681.0s)]
*  Like, dude, what the fuck is this? [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11683.0s)]
*  Delta Skylounge? [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11685.0s)]
*  Think about your Polo here. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11686.0s)]
*  This is fucking crazy. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11687.0s)]
*  You got to keep appreciating it. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11688.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11689.0s)]
*  That's why I would always take Edibles. [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11690.0s)]
*  I would always take Edibles when I flew. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11691.0s)]
*  Because the fly day is just a disaster. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11693.0s)]
*  Like you're just flying in. [[03:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11696.0s)]
*  Like if you got to fly to Philadelphia and you live in LA, like that day is gone. [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11697.0s)]
*  You got five hours on a plane. [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11701.0s)]
*  So I would just take like a 200 milligram edible and just go on a harrowing adventure of the soul. [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11703.0s)]
*  The entire flight. [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11709.0s)]
*  That's psycho. [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11711.0s)]
*  That's psycho. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11713.0s)]
*  That's the Joey Diaz way. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11714.0s)]
*  I learned it from Diaz. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11716.0s)]
*  Diaz and I, when we traveled together, because we started traveling together in the 90s. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11717.0s)]
*  I started taking Joey Diaz with me on the road like 97, 98. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11721.0s)]
*  We did gigs in New Jersey. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11725.0s)]
*  That was the Joey Diaz cocaine years too. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11726.0s)]
*  The reason why I started taking three people, I would take two people on the road with me. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11729.0s)]
*  Two openers. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11732.0s)]
*  It's because Joey didn't show up sometimes. [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11733.0s)]
*  So that's how Ari got to start with me. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11735.0s)]
*  Because I'm like, God, I want to stop taking Joey. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11738.0s)]
*  Because when Joey did show up, he's the fucking life of the party. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11741.0s)]
*  You hoped that he didn't go on a bender. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11744.0s)]
*  And he only did it a couple of times. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11747.0s)]
*  But he did it enough where I was like, I'm going to hedge my bets. [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11749.0s)]
*  And if Joey shows up, we got a three man show. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11752.0s)]
*  If Joey doesn't show up, we got a two man show. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11754.0s)]
*  That's fucking funny. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11758.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they were the best times. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11759.0s)]
*  The driving road trips were the best. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11761.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11763.0s)]
*  Driving. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11764.0s)]
*  Yeah, when Hinchcliffe and I have done driving road trips, he's come up with some of his most ruthless material. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11765.0s)]
*  Making me laugh in the car. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11770.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, you got to say that on stage. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11771.0s)]
*  He's like, really? [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11773.0s)]
*  That's also the best thing. [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11774.0s)]
*  To have your friends with you. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11776.0s)]
*  True. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11777.0s)]
*  Like Matt, if Matt's in the room, I'll be like, I'm going to try the joke that you and me think is funny. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11778.0s)]
*  If I'm by myself, I'll go out there and just do my act. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11783.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11785.0s)]
*  If I know one of my comic friends is in the room, they're going to think it's funny. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11786.0s)]
*  Then it is funny. [[03:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11790.0s)]
*  Then I'm up there like. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11791.0s)]
*  Yeah, it makes it fun. [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11792.0s)]
*  Great way to workshop material too. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11794.0s)]
*  When someone says, you got to say that tonight. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11796.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Puts a gun to you. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11798.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11799.0s)]
*  It's great. [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11800.0s)]
*  It's great. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11801.0s)]
*  Especially when it doesn't work and you're in the back going. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11802.0s)]
*  Hey, what time's your show tonight? [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11803.0s)]
*  We got to wrap this bitch up. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OomvFbR4g&t=11806.0s)]
