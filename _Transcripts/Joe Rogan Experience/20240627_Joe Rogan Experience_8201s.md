# Joe Rogan Experience #1880 - Tulsi Gabbard
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6.4s)]
*  Hello, Joe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=10.48s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=11.48s)]
*  It's good to be back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=12.48s)]
*  It's cracking. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=13.48s)]
*  Nice seeing you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=14.48s)]
*  What's it been like, retiring from being a congresswoman for a wee bit? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=15.48s)]
*  It feels so weird hearing that word. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=23.44s)]
*  Retire? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=25.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=26.76s)]
*  It's a dirty word. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=27.76s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=28.76s)]
*  I believe in retirement. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=29.76s)]
*  I believe in quitting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=30.76s)]
*  Yeah, I suppose. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=31.76s)]
*  Or moving on, rather. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  Moving on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  That's where I've never seen politics as a quote unquote career. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Some people are like, oh, how's it like retiring from congress? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=43.24s)]
*  I can't relate to that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=45.56s)]
*  I'm just continuing the work, but in a different way. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, the way you did it though is what most people should do. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  When people are running for office and then they're also in a job. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=55.04s)]
*  You're not doing a good job at that job. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=60.04s)]
*  There's no way you can be. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=61.64s)]
*  Running for office, just campaign financing, just raising the money for the campaign has [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  to be crazy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=68.8s)]
*  The amount of time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=69.8s)]
*  There's no way that you could be dedicating 100% of your time to your constituents like [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=71.32s)]
*  you should be. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=77.12s)]
*  It has to be your full-time mission. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=79.7s)]
*  I'm thinking of running for office and that's literally what I tell them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=85.16s)]
*  Are you ready to quit everything else in your life and have the support of your family and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=88.64s)]
*  dedicate all your energy towards this mission of service? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  It will require that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=97.56s)]
*  If you're serious about it, it will require that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=98.56s)]
*  If you want to do it at your best. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=100.67999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=103.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=104.84s)]
*  If you want to be truly sincere when you're knocking on people's doors, you're standing [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=105.84s)]
*  in a town hall meeting and you're saying, hey, essentially give me your trust that I [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=110.56s)]
*  will fight for you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=116.36s)]
*  I will speak for you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  I will represent you every single day. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=119.0s)]
*  How are you going to do that if you're like, yeah, by the way, I got this side gig or that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=122.16s)]
*  side gig or this other loyalty that is something other than you, the people, the voter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=125.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=133.76s)]
*  I think more and more people are starting to pick up on that and question that in both [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=134.76s)]
*  people who are running for office and their elected. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  Who are you really working for? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=143.32s)]
*  Well, they certainly should. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=144.92s)]
*  It's a complicated union. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=146.44s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=150.04s)]
*  It is that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=151.04s)]
*  It really is. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=152.04s)]
*  Between money and politics. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=153.04s)]
*  It would be wonderful if we could get money entirely out of politics. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  The only way that a politician could make money while they're in office is just their [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=161.12s)]
*  salary. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=165.24s)]
*  If we said it that way. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=166.24s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware of the Nancy Pelosi stuff. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=167.72s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=170.76s)]
*  It is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=171.76s)]
*  I think this is one of the good things about social media is of course the mainstream corporate [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=173.8s)]
*  media is hardly covering it at all. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=178.68s)]
*  But because of social media, things like that are spreading like wildfire. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=181.76s)]
*  Like, hey, Paul Pelosi is doing these trades within this period of time of Nancy Pelosi [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=185.52s)]
*  voting on this bill or bringing a bill to the floor because we've got to remember Nancy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=190.08s)]
*  Pelosi as Speaker of the House, nothing happens without her knowing about it or giving her [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=196.0s)]
*  stamp of approval. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=202.18s)]
*  So regardless of whether it's happening in the Judiciary Committee or the Commerce Committee [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=203.92s)]
*  or the Armed Services Committee, if there's a bill coming to the floor and there's major [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=208.24s)]
*  legislation that's being passed or is being squashed, that is happening with her say so. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=212.34s)]
*  And so so just in these last few days, you know, they once people started making noise [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=220.48s)]
*  saying, hey, you as a member of Congress or your spouse or your adult child should not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  be allowed to conduct insider trading on issues that Congress is dealing with, which which [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  really covers every issue under the spectrum. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=235.44s)]
*  They can't pretend anymore that they haven't been doing it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=239.07999999999998s)]
*  And yet, even as a Nazi policy like, OK, OK, fine, we'll draft legislation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  Congress is about to take a break as they head into the general elections. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  And once again, she's refusing to bring the bill to the floor for a vote saying, oh, well, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=251.92s)]
*  you know, we're not going to bring it to the floor if it doesn't have support. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Put people on the fricking spot. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=260.68s)]
*  Make them cast that vote. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=262.32s)]
*  That is the last thing she wants right before the election. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=264.48s)]
*  That honey pot. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=267.76s)]
*  She doesn't first of all, she doesn't want it becoming a big important thing that people [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  are talking about. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=273.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=273.96s)]
*  Where people start, excuse me, where people start looking at it and say, well, how much [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=274.72s)]
*  money have you made? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=281.64s)]
*  Like, why are you worth two hundred million dollars? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=282.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=283.8s)]
*  You make two hundred thousand dollars a year. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  You're worth two hundred million dollars. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  Like, what's going on? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=287.04s)]
*  What? And you look at like Paul Pelosi stock, like what his his record is, he's better than [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=288.2s)]
*  Warren Buffett and George Soros, who are like wizards. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=294.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=298.2s)]
*  Those guys are the best. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=299.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=300.64s)]
*  Better than them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=300.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=301.56s)]
*  But it's it's 100 percent insider trading. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=302.08s)]
*  You think about what they put Martha Stewart away in jail for. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=305.52s)]
*  That's nothing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=309.28s)]
*  That's nothing compared to what she's doing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=310.84s)]
*  And she's not the only one, obviously. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=312.96s)]
*  There are. And this is where, you know, the the the quote unquote uniparty in Washington [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=315.2s)]
*  has been blocking this kind of legislation from being passed because they're they're [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=320.44s)]
*  both benefiting from it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=325.88s)]
*  We had I think the Republican and Democrat senators in the lead up towards Covid who [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=326.88s)]
*  knew about it, right, and started making different investments in as we were approaching [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=333.67999999999995s)]
*  it, even before the rest of the country knew about it so that they could profit financially [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=339.12s)]
*  from it. Just absolutely disgusting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  It's crazy. It's just it's just crazy that it's legal. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=346.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=349.96s)]
*  It's it's it's really egregious and it's shocking how complicit the mainstream media [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=350.36s)]
*  is in ignoring it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=358.12s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=359.52s)]
*  Like, do you think that there is some discussion or is it just an understanding that you'll [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=359.96s)]
*  lose access to these people if you highlight this? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=366.88s)]
*  Like, what is why are they not covering that? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=370.4s)]
*  It's like this this chummy insiders club in Washington and, you know, a common term [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=373.24s)]
*  that's being used now is called permanent Washington, which really fits when you think [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=380.48s)]
*  about it, because it kind of encapsulates that whole swampy ecosystem of both those [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=384.88s)]
*  who've been elected into positions, those who are longtime appointed or powerful [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=391.56s)]
*  bureaucrats and the corporate media. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=397.8s)]
*  They all go out to the same parties, the same social functions, you know, passing information [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=400.04s)]
*  to each other. And so, you know, if the anchor of a big time news show says, hey, guys, guess [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=405.12s)]
*  what? Nancy Pelosi and her husband are our insider trading, then they have to think about, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=413.0s)]
*  oh, well, am I cut? Am I burning a bridge? Am I cutting off access to, you know, information [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=418.52s)]
*  that she or her staff might be feeding me that I can break news on and all this stuff? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=423.24s)]
*  So, you know, it's like you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. And if you start pissing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=427.6s)]
*  off certain people, then you get kicked out of the cool kids club. That's really what's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=432.52000000000004s)]
*  at the heart of it. And so they play along because this issue has come up before. It [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=437.36s)]
*  came up years ago. Congress said, OK, we're going to take action to stop insider trading [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=443.08000000000004s)]
*  and make sure that elected leaders aren't benefiting off of insider information. And [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=447.8s)]
*  Act, which did nothing. Essentially, it just said, OK, if you are going to, you know, trade [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=453.16s)]
*  in stocks or buy or sell stocks, you have to report it. You have to be transparent about [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=461.16s)]
*  it. Most of Congress has failed to do even that. So it did nothing to stop it. Says you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=466.76000000000005s)]
*  just got to tell us. And most people are like, yeah, I'm not going to tell you anyway. And [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=473.04s)]
*  there's no repercussions. Well, they might get like a hundred dollar fine, two hundred [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=476.76000000000005s)]
*  dollar fine as as they make millions in their in their trade. So, you know, again, it's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=480.7s)]
*  good. It's this is this is kind of like one of those things that should give us all a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=486.4s)]
*  glimmer of hope where if enough people, we the people make noise about it, they're forced [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=490.86s)]
*  to pay attention. So now what about when we're talking about like chumminess and like sort [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=497.86s)]
*  of like the hidden rules? What about if you do right wing talk shows? Like if you're a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=504.38s)]
*  Democrat and you decide to go on Tucker Carlson, for instance, like what is that like? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=511.34s)]
*  It ranges from people kind of like giving you a cynical look like whose side are you really on [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=519.86s)]
*  to people just outright ending ending that friendship or that professional relationship [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=526.5s)]
*  because they don't want to have anything to do with you. Have you experienced that over and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=534.34s)]
*  over? Really? Over and over. And it's not just Tucker Carlson. There's been this negative [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=538.3000000000001s)]
*  stigma for almost as long as I've served in Congress against anyone who actually goes on [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=545.26s)]
*  Fox News, period. And so you could say like and I do I was like, hey, more people watch Fox [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=551.0600000000001s)]
*  News than any other cable news channel. So my audience is speaking to the American people. If [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=557.58s)]
*  I have the opportunity to do that, and by the way, Fox News more than CNN and MSNBC over the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=561.98s)]
*  last decade has been more fair to me in providing me that opportunity to speak to the American [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=567.46s)]
*  people. I'm going to take advantage of it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=574.7s)]
*  What seems like one of the things that Fox News does well is if they have a Democrat on, they [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=577.02s)]
*  don't attack them. They allow them to express themselves. That's right. Which is interesting, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=581.86s)]
*  whether the host agrees or disagrees. That's not the point. Because when a right wing person [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=587.0600000000001s)]
*  seems to be if they're on MSNBC or if they're on CNN, it's like they have these weapons ready [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=592.1s)]
*  to go. The blades are sharp and they attack and they're trying to discredit that person trying [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=598.74s)]
*  to mock them. They will talk over them. They will be rude to them. They will mock whatever [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=603.66s)]
*  position they have. And instead of like trying to offer some sort of a reasonable debate [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=608.02s)]
*  against it, they will just they will talk over it and mock it and they'll bring on an [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=613.74s)]
*  extra another expert. And that person talks over it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=618.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not even limited to those who bring like a so-called right wing perspective or [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=621.7s)]
*  conservative perspective. It's really anyone who brings a voice, a view, a perspective that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=627.14s)]
*  is different from whatever the mainstream narrative is at that point, whatever the cause [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=633.5s)]
*  of the day may be. And so as a Democrat serving in Congress, I experienced that over and over [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=639.66s)]
*  again, exactly that reaction that you're talking about in not allowing me at least just to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=646.42s)]
*  come and present my view. They can they can ask me a tough question. They can present an [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  opposing view. That's great. But so many times I've gone on these different shows and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=658.9s)]
*  they don't they don't even allow that. And it really just speaks to what is really a [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=665.22s)]
*  dangerous mentality amongst the Democratic Party leadership and kind of this this [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=670.22s)]
*  establishment narrative in Washington, which is they don't believe in freedom. They don't [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=676.74s)]
*  believe in freedom of speech or freedom of thought. And for anyone who brings an opposing [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  view, they they choose to shut you up, silence you, smear you, try to ruin you or undermine [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=687.98s)]
*  your character and credibility because they don't believe in freedom of speech. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=694.98s)]
*  Because, you know, they don't want the weakness or the insecurity of their own argument to be [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=700.0600000000001s)]
*  exposed. And also, they immediately judge you as someone who may bring an opposing view, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=703.7s)]
*  regardless of your political party, as as the enemy, as a threat, as somebody who who [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=708.7s)]
*  is is less than and doesn't deserve a voice, which is really, really dangerous for our [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=716.02s)]
*  democracy when you really think about it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=720.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's very spooky. And it's spooky how prevalent that that mindset is and how many [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=722.1s)]
*  Democrats, not even just politicians, just people that are Democrats, how many people [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=729.1s)]
*  share that position that you should silence people that you don't agree with? And it's [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=732.5400000000001s)]
*  just it's such a foolish perspective. And it's it plays out historically over and over [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=737.34s)]
*  and over again in a terrible way. I just don't understand why people don't learn that lesson. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=745.14s)]
*  I think that I think that the Democratic Party leaders, people like Hillary Clinton, people [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=750.86s)]
*  who've been in charge for a very long time, foment this kind of culture of fear and like, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=758.1800000000001s)]
*  hey, if you go against us, like you're dead, you're on the shit list. You have kind of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=765.66s)]
*  the the very loud activists in the who don't represent, I think, even the majority of the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  Democratic Party, but the the AOCs of the world who who are almost like these these [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=776.22s)]
*  radical religious zealots and they are ideologues and whatever they choose is the battle of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=783.6600000000001s)]
*  the day. Yes. If you are against them on that, forget it. You're done. What is that woman's [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=791.94s)]
*  name Rashida? Tlaib. Yeah, I I'm sure you watched this where she was communicating with the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=798.38s)]
*  heads of these banks and she was asking them about you should see this. See if you can [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=805.0600000000001s)]
*  find this where she's talking to these heads of these banks where they're talking about [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=810.62s)]
*  funding fossil fuel projects in the future. And she's she asked them point blank, will [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=815.14s)]
*  you fund fossil fuel projects in the future? And they said yes. And if we didn't, that [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=822.26s)]
*  would be devastating to the United States. And then she goes on. We'll play it for you [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=826.82s)]
*  because it's Jamie. I'll find it. It's so bonkers because the first thing she goes to [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=831.86s)]
*  is we gave student debt forgiveness and those people have bank accounts and they we're going [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=837.58s)]
*  to urge them to take their money out of your bank account. So it's like we bribe these [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=844.5400000000001s)]
*  people by giving them ten grand. Right. If you really want to help them, make it so that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=848.74s)]
*  you can get out of student debt. You really you really want to help them. Make it show [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=854.14s)]
*  that make it so that a bankruptcy actually absolves you of student debt because it doesn't [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=857.46s)]
*  because it's a corrupt system. So like fuck all this. You're ten grand because ten grand [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=863.6600000000001s)]
*  is nonsense. These people are one hundred and fifty two hundred thousand dollars in [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=868.74s)]
*  the hole. And some of them actually wind up getting their Social Security docked when [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=872.62s)]
*  they're in their 60s because they still owe money from student loans that didn't help [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=876.86s)]
*  them at all. Exactly. And she uses that she holds it over their head. Meanwhile, she does [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=881.38s)]
*  not understand the incredibly complex variables that are involved in the elimination of fossil [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=887.62s)]
*  fuels or how many fossil fuels are involved in every single thing you do, including electric [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=894.66s)]
*  cars, the construction of solar panels, like everything, the transportation of goods and [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=901.4s)]
*  services. This idea that you're just going to stop all future projects because you think [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=906.54s)]
*  what your ideological group wants. Right. Play it. Let me see. Let me see your face. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=913.5799999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's it. This is it. So you have all committed, as you all know, to transition [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=924.5s)]
*  the emissions from lending and investment activity to line with pathways to net zero [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=932.26s)]
*  in 2050. Do you know what the International Energy Agency has said is required to meet [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=936.86s)]
*  our goal global 2050 net zero targets of limiting global temperature rise to two point seven [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=943.86s)]
*  degrees Fahrenheit or one point five degrees Celsius. So no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=949.34s)]
*  no. Well, I would like to ask all of you and go down the list because again, you all agreed [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=958.34s)]
*  to doing this. Please answer with a simple yes or no. Does your bank have a policy against [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=964.38s)]
*  funding new oil and gas products? Mr. Diamond? Absolutely not. And that would be the road [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=968.86s)]
*  to hell for America. Yeah, that's fine. No, no, no. There's more. This is just this is [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=974.7s)]
*  like a Fox News clip. There's more of her. See if you can find the rest of it. You can [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=983.26s)]
*  find an actual clip of the conversation. So this nonsense with the music over it, because [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=988.58s)]
*  the actual clip of the conversation shows like she goes down the line and talks to these [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=992.74s)]
*  guys and they all say no. Everyone says no because it's not reality. You can't just hit [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=996.86s)]
*  the brakes and then just that's what happened with COVID. You see how the economy collapsed [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1003.26s)]
*  when you make everyone shut their business down. That's going to happen times a thousand [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1009.1800000000001s)]
*  if you just stop all fossil fuel production. Didn't we just see this in California where [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1013.7s)]
*  they passed a law? What is it requiring requiring all electric vehicles or stopping production [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1018.14s)]
*  of vehicles that use gas? Yes, all cars that are sold in California as of twenty thirty [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1024.7s)]
*  five must be electrical. And then the next week they said you can't charge your electric [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1030.62s)]
*  car because the power grid's fucked. Exactly. That's California politics in a nutshell, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1035.22s)]
*  though, because it's so ideologically driven. And I talk to people from California that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1041.46s)]
*  are just in in that fog. Yeah, the fog of woke and they're my friends and I'll show [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1046.74s)]
*  them that. And they're like, what? Really? Yeah, look, you're not supposed to charge [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1052.94s)]
*  your electric car. What the fuck? Yeah, what the fuck? But that right? Like that's that's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1056.78s)]
*  like the that's the analogy. That is the example of exactly what we're talking about. This [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1061.7s)]
*  whole mentality of of woke ism, of being ideologues that that not only doesn't make sense, but [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1066.82s)]
*  if you don't agree with it, you're wrong. You're the enemy. If you're silent, right, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1073.5s)]
*  if you just don't like I got no comment on this. Well, you are now complicit in the problem. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1078.74s)]
*  Exactly. And silence is violence. And then and again, I have experience with all of like [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1083.62s)]
*  this whole spectrum. And then like if you're like, OK, like like get off my ass. Fine. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1089.34s)]
*  I agree. They're like, well, prove it. Prove it. You need to stand on the street corner. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1094.14s)]
*  You need to scream out loud. You need to do all this. And, you know, the women's march [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1099.46s)]
*  when Trump got elected, right? I didn't go. I was out of the country. I got harassed and [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1104.66s)]
*  harangued. Why weren't you there wearing the pink pussy hat? What is wrong with you? You [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1111.02s)]
*  must not believe in in women's rights. You must. And irony is here we are sitting now [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1115.38s)]
*  with a lot of these same people who like, oh, well, I don't know how to define a woman. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1120.14s)]
*  There is no such thing as a woman. And it just but all of these examples point to the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1124.7s)]
*  hypocrisy, the fact that they don't believe in truth and that whatever their cause of [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1130.8200000000002s)]
*  the moment is, is whatever they decide is the truth and the thing that must be measured [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1136.8600000000001s)]
*  against for you. Like you're either with us or you're against us. And if you're with us, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1142.0600000000002s)]
*  you've got to prove your zealousness for for the cause. Is that a word? I think so. I think [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1147.5400000000002s)]
*  so. Sounds good. If it's you know, it's there's a chess game. And the ultimate checkmate is [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1154.22s)]
*  what's a woman? Yeah. I mean, when you're coming to with wokeness and any you can identify as [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1163.14s)]
*  a woman, you get to use the female restroom. Like, OK, but what is it? What's a woman? You [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1168.5s)]
*  know, can a man get pregnant? Yes. OK, well, what is it? Can a biological male get pregnant? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1173.42s)]
*  And then people panic and they start the people that identify as a woman are capable of being [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1179.38s)]
*  pregnant and people that identify as a male are capable of also being pregnant. Like, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1188.5800000000002s)]
*  what are you saying? What's it say? If you identify as a woman, what are you identifying [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1194.2600000000002s)]
*  as? Like, that's the documentary, the Matt Walsh documentary, which is fucking amazing. And also [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1198.66s)]
*  amazing that no one's reviewing it. No one's reviewing it. That documentary is fantastic [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1204.02s)]
*  because Matt Walsh allow and you can only get it on the daily wire, I think, which is unfortunate, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1211.22s)]
*  but I get it. You know, I get it. The daily wire produced it. They want people to sign up and [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1217.06s)]
*  they're creating this alternative platform for content. But that documentary is so good [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1221.1399999999999s)]
*  because Matt Walsh simply asks questions and he does it deadpan. And it's amazing watching [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1226.98s)]
*  these people just like twist reality into some weird fucking contortion it's not. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1235.22s)]
*  What are you saying? What is a woman? What does it mean? Yeah, it's so revealing. You know, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1244.5s)]
*  you're marching for women's rights, but what does that mean? So if I decide I'm a woman and I go out, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1250.1s)]
*  you're marching for me, I'm a woman now. You could just say it. We can't have that. That [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1254.18s)]
*  doesn't make sense. And it doesn't mean you can't have trans people. It doesn't mean that. You can [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1259.78s)]
*  most certainly. And it doesn't mean you're against. Yes. You're not denying anyone's existence either. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1264.3400000000001s)]
*  They exist. However, if you want to be pregnant, you must be a biological female. This is science. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1269.94s)]
*  This is something that we have all studied and looked at and observed. And this is fucking [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1277.54s)]
*  doctrine. It's no getting around it. Yeah. If you want to breed, if you want the egg in the womb, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1284.82s)]
*  you want the whole thing to happen. The uterus, the baby. That's a woman. Yeah. Just because you [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1291.22s)]
*  have a fucking beard because you're taking testosterone. You're still a woman. Yeah. Like [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1296.6599999999999s)]
*  this is crazy. And that's what was so powerful about that documentary was both Matt Walsh's [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1300.26s)]
*  demeanor and frankly, his respect with whoever he was questioning and the spectrum of people that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1304.9s)]
*  he spoke to on this from psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, professors, and even [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1312.18s)]
*  the woman who transitioned hormonally. It was terrible regret. To become a man who was crying [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1320.26s)]
*  on camera. That's the problem in this country. Everyone wants to talk about representation. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1326.66s)]
*  Here's what's not represented at all in the mainstream media. People that have had a horrible [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1332.9s)]
*  experience having gender transition surgery and regret it deeply. There's a lot of them. It's not [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1339.22s)]
*  a small amount. It's a lot of people. It's not a cut and dry thing. Look, if there was a way [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1345.38s)]
*  where we had some sort of genetic engineering, where some super advanced form of CRISPR, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1352.98s)]
*  where I could just decide I want to be a woman now and then bam, now I have a double X chromosome. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1359.3s)]
*  I have a vagina. I'm an actual woman. Like 100%. Not surgery. And here's the other thing. It's like [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1365.22s)]
*  if you're saying that you identify as a woman, that you're a woman, okay, why do you have to [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1372.98s)]
*  get an operation then? Right. Why do you have to take hormones? Why do you have to do all that stuff? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1376.8999999999999s)]
*  And that stuff seems to be where all the problem lies because that is purely experimental. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1381.86s)]
*  Especially when it comes to children. Like we're now finding when they're talking about hormone [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1387.6200000000001s)]
*  blockers, they were saying hormone blockers are reversible and there's no side effects. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1392.02s)]
*  That's not true at all. They're finding horrific side effects for kids who take those things. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  And we don't have a lot of long-term data. We just don't. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1400.18s)]
*  Yeah. It's so dangerous that the Biden administration's Health and Human Services [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1403.14s)]
*  Secretary is openly advocating for this. Parents and schools and the community need to support this [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1410.34s)]
*  quote unquote gender affirming care and treatment for kids knowing what we know, even the limited [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1417.9399999999998s)]
*  knowledge of what we know about the impacts of these hormone treatments, the impacts of these [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1425.3799999999999s)]
*  irreversible surgeries, both physically as well as mentally as more and more even of these kids [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1430.58s)]
*  who come forward who've gone through this with incredible regret and talking about the longstanding [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1436.5s)]
*  symptoms and problems and illnesses they're now having to deal with. We have the person who's [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1442.74s)]
*  supposed to be in charge of federal health policy for the country saying, no, no, no, this is exactly [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1448.1s)]
*  what we should be doing and encouraging parents and kids to go and get this treatment. It is [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1454.42s)]
*  it is an advocating for abuse of children. And it's something that more and more people need to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1459.86s)]
*  stand up against. But the fact that we don't have more people speaking out about this speaks to this [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1468.9799999999998s)]
*  culture of fear that we're talking about. Right. And you can't even talk about it because that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1475.62s)]
*  person is trans, which is even crazier. So the person who's advocating for children to transition [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1479.2199999999998s)]
*  also is trans. And I'm sure you saw the Rand Paul interview where Rand Paul is questioning her [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1485.14s)]
*  and asking questions. And it's like talking to an alien. Yeah. It's like he's talking to an alien [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1491.46s)]
*  that has a tape recorder that's going to press play every time the question's over. Thank you, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1496.42s)]
*  Senator. You know, transgender care is nuanced and like goes into this speech and Rand Paul says, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1500.3400000000001s)]
*  just let it be set on record that the person is not answering these questions. Exactly. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1507.0600000000002s)]
*  And the worst thing that I don't know how well known this is, but I saw a brochure that [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1511.8600000000001s)]
*  that the Department of Health and Human Services put out on what is gender affirming care. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1517.7800000000002s)]
*  It basically says that if parents refuse or fail to provide this gender affirming care, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1525.38s)]
*  then child protective services will have the authority to step in and try to intervene for [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1532.1000000000001s)]
*  the sake of the child. Wow. And so when you look at... Wow. So if a kid is just going through [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1538.18s)]
*  a period in their life where they decide I'm a girl or I'm a boy. Right. And the parents say, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1546.1000000000001s)]
*  hey, let's wait until you turn 18. You might grow out of this. And the kid's like, fuck that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1551.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm calling child protective services. And then Homeland Security or whoever the hell it is comes [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1556.5800000000002s)]
*  in and physically forces the parents to do the bidding of the minor child. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1561.86s)]
*  With the threat of taking your child away from you. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1569.86s)]
*  How did anybody allow it to get this far? Like who... Are there no adults in the room? I mean, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1574.82s)]
*  that's a big expression, right? It is. That was the thing that everyone said we were going to love [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1581.3799999999999s)]
*  about the Biden administration. Right. The adults are back in the room. Yeah. Really? Like what... [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1585.06s)]
*  Is everyone out of their fucking mind? Like we know children are incredibly malleable. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1590.1s)]
*  We know children are impulsive. They decide... Like there's kids... Ready for this? My friend, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1595.54s)]
*  his wife, is a school teacher. And she works at a school that had to install a litter box [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1603.06s)]
*  in the girls' room because there is a girl who's a furry who identifies as an animal. And her mother [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1611.3799999999999s)]
*  badgered the school until they agreed to put a litter box in one of the stalls. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1618.5s)]
*  So this girl goes into the litter room or to the girls' room and urinates or whatever. I don't know [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1625.3799999999999s)]
*  if she poops in it. That's pretty gross. Like if you could teach your cat, by the way, here's the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1631.86s)]
*  thing. If you could teach your cat to use the toilet, you would. Okay? Yeah. Like you don't want [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1637.1399999999999s)]
*  a box of piss in your house. It's the worst... I've had cats my whole life. It's the worst thing about [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1642.66s)]
*  having cats. You gotta clean that box of piss every day. Yeah. It's the greatest thing about [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1646.9s)]
*  dogs. They go outside. Like you're a fucking human. The cats got their humans trained. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1651.22s)]
*  Imagine how crazy that is. You're a fucking human being and you prefer a litter box. You want to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1656.18s)]
*  piss into a pile of sand rather than use a bathroom that you could flush the toilet, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1661.38s)]
*  wipe yourself like a normal person. Like you're so crazy with what you think an animal is that [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1667.7s)]
*  not only have you said this, but you've conned the school into putting this fucking litter box [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1674.1s)]
*  in a girl's room, which is bananas. It is. It's absolutely insane. I'm sure you saw the teacher [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1681.3799999999999s)]
*  in Washington state that has the giant rubber boobs. Oh my God, I did. And then the school is [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1687.6999999999998s)]
*  now... Giant is an understatement. But here's the thing about these giant boobs. And this is a male [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1693.3s)]
*  teacher. Yes. This is a male teacher who had... They're not fake boobs. They're fake fake boobs. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1699.22s)]
*  This is what I mean. Like if you knock your teeth out, like if I go lift weights, I hit myself in [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1707.6200000000001s)]
*  the face with a kettlebell and knock my teeth out, they'll replace my teeth with fake teeth. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1714.26s)]
*  But if I have these teeth that are my real teeth and I put fake teeth over them, those are fake [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1719.06s)]
*  teeth. So this person, these are not fake boobs. Like they went and got an operation and had breast [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1724.98s)]
*  augmentation. No, they put giant rubber boobs. They're like watermelon size. They're real boobs. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1730.8200000000002s)]
*  I wish I could find a watermelon that big. I love watermelon. If I could find a watermelon that big, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1738.1000000000001s)]
*  they're so big, it's crazy. What was the point of that by the way? I think it's a troll. And I have [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1743.14s)]
*  been reading about this online. Apparently there's many people that are pointing to the fact that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1750.02s)]
*  this teacher may very well be scamming people. What does it say? Whether or not it was satire? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1756.26s)]
*  Yeah, I was reading something. It shows where the power lies. Talking about that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1763.46s)]
*  Was the fake boobs teacher... Oh, okay. Interesting. So what I've heard is that this [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1766.66s)]
*  is actually, this teacher is actually a conservative man and that he's doing this as a goof and also [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1771.94s)]
*  knows he can never get fired. Like maybe trying to get fired. Interesting. See what does the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1778.42s)]
*  article say? Does it say anything? This article brings up the same stuff that James Lindsay did [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1783.46s)]
*  where they made those fake articles to get pushed. Yeah, the grievance articles. Yeah. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1788.26s)]
*  Similar thing. There's a law. I'm trying to read and think at the same time. I can't do that. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1793.14s)]
*  No worries. Because the teacher could probably... Yeah, so here it is. The Peter Boghossian, Helen [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1802.02s)]
*  Pluckrose and James Lindsay see the peer-reviewed journals with absurd critical studies papers, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1807.86s)]
*  which was amazing that they'd simply made up, caused a huge stir, but neither academia's [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1813.22s)]
*  perverse incentives nor the often ridiculous stances on critical studies have noticeably [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1818.34s)]
*  changed as a result. Academia still publishing apparently sincerely autoethnographic... How do [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1823.22s)]
*  you say that word? Ethno... Graphic? Graphic. Autoethnographic studies about pedophilic [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1830.66s)]
*  masturbation. What is that? What? Click on that link. What are they saying? What is this study? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1837.3000000000002s)]
*  We'll come back to this in a moment. I want to know what the fuck they're talking about. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1845.22s)]
*  So university investigators, PhD. Yeah, click on that. Okay. Click on that real quick. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1850.26s)]
*  University investigates PhD students' paper on masturbating to comics of young boys. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1854.18s)]

*  details masturbation sessions. A leading university has launched an inquiry after it emerged that one [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1866.5800000000002s)]
*  of its PhD students has written a research paper about sexual attraction to young boys. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1873.5400000000002s)]
*  Carl Anderson spent three months recording his thoughts and feelings while masturbating over [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1879.5400000000002s)]
*  images of young boys in Japanese comic books. In the abstract for the paper, Anderson, who's [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1886.9s)]
*  interviewing fans of Shota, I guess, S-H-O-T-A comics for his PhD, said he wanted to understand [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1892.74s)]
*  how they experience sexual pleasure while reading Shota. Oh, you wanted to understand. I get it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1900.8200000000002s)]
*  Normal. His 4,000 word study, which detailed his sexual habits and sexual encounters between boys [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1907.5400000000002s)]
*  in the comics, was published in the journal Qualitative Research in April. It provoked [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1914.02s)]
*  outrage from academics and MP and others after it was circulated on Twitter this week. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1919.46s)]
*  Yeah, there's a normalization of all kinds of sexual attraction, including illegal sexual [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1927.3s)]
*  attraction. They're trying to say that people aren't pedophiles. They're minor attracted [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1936.1s)]
*  individuals. Go back to that article, Jamie, if you don't mind. Just see that bottom part. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1942.74s)]
*  This is the guy, right? The guy who did this research. He says, I happened to live alone [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1949.3s)]
*  during this experiment and I had newly become single after a long relationship. Those factors [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1953.86s)]
*  probably contributed to my willingness and eagerness to explore this method. Sick. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1959.1399999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. Sick. This is exactly, when you don't believe in truth and you're talking [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1966.58s)]
*  about the furries, the accommodations for this child who identifies as a cat in the school, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1978.26s)]
*  then you have the minor attracted persons. There are no boundaries anymore. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1985.46s)]
*  Right. There are no boundaries. The teachers in the school and the school itself should have said, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1991.62s)]
*  no to the parent. No crazy. First of all, what are you doing to your kid that you let your kid, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=1995.14s)]
*  because they identify as an animal, use a litter box? They're still human. Use a goddamn bathroom. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2001.94s)]
*  It's sanitary. It's much better. Do you want your house to smell like human pee? What if they eat [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2008.5s)]
*  asparagus and then they pee into a box? You don't think that's gross? You want to go into the [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2013.3000000000002s)]
*  bathroom and smell asparagus pee because your kid is fucking crazy and you're encouraging that? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2017.5400000000002s)]
*  That's nuts. Go back to that big boob gentleman slash female hoaxer. I want to finish where we're [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2023.06s)]
*  at. Try to figure out what is happening here. We're right around here. Okay, we're right around there. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2032.02s)]
*  In much the same way, if the Moo is attempting to force an absurd anti-discrimination law [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2039.7s)]
*  to breaking point, the attempt has failed. Rather than forcing the school to confront [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2045.7s)]
*  the grotesque absurdity of letting a male wear prosthetic boobs to a teaching job, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2050.66s)]
*  it simply promoted a debate on what size and shape the prosthetic should be. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2057.46s)]
*  Oh my God. The school exacerbated at the international attention they've garnered [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2066.1s)]
*  has simply approved a new dress code that would force the Moo to wear slightly smaller fake boobs. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2072.66s)]
*  But what if you actually have real augmented boobs that are that big? Because people do. Go back to [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2080.1800000000003s)]
*  that please. Click on the new dress code. I need to find out what they're fucking... What are you guys [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2087.62s)]
*  are out of your mind? How far are they bending over backwards? This is a school, not a circus. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2095.06s)]
*  Students joined protesters outside the Canadian school with trans teacher with oversized prosthetic [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2100.34s)]
*  breasts. I don't think it's really a trans teacher. I think they're calling this person [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2104.5s)]
*  a trans teacher, but according to Reddit, which I hold in high regard... I was trying to do some [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2108.66s)]
*  research on Kayla real quick. Yeah, what are they saying? I had to go back to the article first. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2115.14s)]
*  Yeah, me and Duncan were actually going back and forth about it yesterday trying to figure out [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2121.7s)]
*  how much of a hoax it was and laughing hysterically. Because if it is a hoax, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2125.54s)]
*  along the lines of the Helen Pluck Rose and Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay studies, it's really [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2129.8599999999997s)]
*  funny. It's really funny because this person has taken it to the umpteenth degree. Exactly. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2134.02s)]
*  For folks just listening, these things are the size of a small child. If a small child, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2140.74s)]
*  like if a six-year-old was in the fetal position and they hung from your neck, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2147.38s)]
*  that would literally be the size of one of these breasts. Yeah, exactly. I think the point remains, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2151.3s)]
*  whether it's a hoax or not, it points to how insane our society and culture has become [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2156.58s)]
*  rather than the school being like, yo, no, this is not happening. Yo is the perfect thing to say there. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2164.3399999999997s)]
*  What are you doing, man? Exactly. I don't believe that. You're in wood shop, okay? Which is you're [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2175.2999999999997s)]
*  not even supposed to have loose clothes. How do you have giant rubber boots? That's so dangerous. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2180.98s)]
*  It is. He's using a bandsaw. Excuse me. She's using a bandsaw. Look at that. Look at the size [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2185.46s)]
*  of those things. Imagine these poor fucking kids. Imagine you go in there and she's wearing [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2191.14s)]
*  sunglasses indoors too, which is awesome. Right. I mean, the whole thing is just so crazy. Canada is [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2197.46s)]
*  like California on some sort of SSRI. It's like they've taken it to a whole new level. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2205.7s)]
*  Okay, so right there is Kayla Lemieux. That's a YouTube video. There's a bunch of YouTube videos. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2212.3399999999997s)]
*  Culture, end game. Look at the size of the nipples. That's so crazy. The nipples are enormous. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2218.66s)]
*  This person literally has shoulder straps. Yeah. Like they're backpacking in the woods. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2225.86s)]
*  Like they've got a week's worth of food in those things. They're carrying around on their back. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2231.54s)]
*  That's so nuts. Yeah, clear shoulder straps. I mean, it's... Look at the Twitter, the tweet. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2235.94s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Kayla Lemieux is conclusive proof that trans women are women and that there's absolutely [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2243.22s)]
*  no connection between trans activism and mental health issues or misogyny. Sure. Conclusive. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2249.14s)]
*  Yeah. Well, obviously that's satire. Obviously. Yeah. I would have never imagined if we went four [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2256.18s)]
*  or five years ago. I remember when I had Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay on the podcast years [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2263.22s)]
*  ago, people were saying to me, like, why are you concentrating on this? This is some stuff that's [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2269.46s)]
*  happening at universities. Why is this even... Why are you obsessed with this? And I said, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2274.98s)]
*  because this is going to spill over into society. Exactly. You don't see this. It's like if we have [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2280.9s)]
*  barbarians that land in Hawaii and they start attacking, marauding, and they get in their boats [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2287.7s)]
*  and they start moving towards America. And you go like, well, hey, I think this is coming here. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2294.9s)]
*  Why are you concentrating on that? This is only happening in Hawaii. No, they're fucking in the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2300.98s)]
*  boats now, kids. They're in the boats and now they've hit land. And now they're burning through [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2306.42s)]
*  tech industry. They're burning through so many corporations because all this craziness is an [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2313.06s)]
*  accepted ideology in universities. So you let these children get away from their parents. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2319.78s)]
*  Fuck my mom and dad. My mom and dad are bullshit and they're racist and fascist and this and that. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2324.7400000000002s)]
*  And then they go to school, which their mom and dad paid for probably, or they got crazy student [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2329.3s)]
*  loans they can never get away from. And then they infect these corporations. So you have these [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2333.3s)]
*  people that are in their fifties and sixties that are running these corporations go, whoa, whoa, whoa, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2338.5s)]
*  what the fuck is going on? This is crazy. You want a litter box in the bathroom? What? That's [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2342.98s)]
*  happening in tech companies too. Yeah. You talk to, I've talked to a number of different CEOs who've [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2349.06s)]
*  very clearly expressed that their biggest headache in life is with their HR departments. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2355.46s)]
*  Yeah. They're trying to like, what in the world are we doing here? That's what, you know, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2360.58s)]
*  we started this by saying like, how did we get here? Yeah. What you just outlined is exactly [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2364.66s)]
*  how we got here. So much of this has been happening already, you know, for decades in some of these [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2368.42s)]
*  incredibly, I don't even know what you call them in a lot of the universities. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2374.58s)]
*  And then you start seeing it. Okay, well here's the boundary today. Okay, cool. Got that. We're [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2379.62s)]
*  going to shift it. We're going to shift the, you know, the goalpost. Okay, cool. Got that. We're [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2384.42s)]
*  going to shift the goalpost. We're going to shift the goalpost. It never ends. It doesn't. It never [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2388.82s)]
*  ends. And that's where the, the thing that I, you know, people warned against in the past, but it's [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2392.74s)]
*  hard to imagine that it would be possible, certainly within our lifetimes, the normalization [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2400.5s)]
*  of pedophilia. Yes. What you said, the minor attracted persons and don't stigmatize that, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2404.82s)]
*  you know, we're all people, we should all be allowed to celebrate ourselves and all this other crap. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2410.74s)]
*  We're talking about kids. Yeah. And how a lot of these same people who are saying, hey, if you [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2416.26s)]
*  refuse to use pronouns, you're fired. A friend of mine in a, in a huge New York law firm, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2422.74s)]
*  corporate policy is you have to put your pronouns in your email signature block, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2430.18s)]
*  or you will have to talk to the HR department. And he's like one of the partners at this law firm. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2436.42s)]
*  He's like, this is bullshit. Now, why do they make that distinction? Why, what, what kind of pressure [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2440.9s)]
*  forced them into having something as crazy as like you have to have your pronouns? I don't know. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2449.22s)]
*  It's, I think that it's driven by fear. But it was like, what percentage of the people [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2456.02s)]
*  are having a problem identifying someone without pronouns? Yeah. Like how many people are we talking [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2463.62s)]
*  about? I would imagine it's a very small number. It's a very small number. It just, the number of [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2470.1s)]
*  people that identify as trans is higher than it's ever been before, which is really weird [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2474.98s)]
*  that that's not consistent. And you could say, well, it's because they feel comfortable doing [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2479.46s)]
*  that because it's an accepted part of society. Like maybe, but according to Abigail Schreier, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2483.14s)]
*  who wrote that book, Irreversible Damage, with young girls, it's up an extraordinary amount, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2488.1s)]
*  like a preposterous amount where they have these clusters of girls who identify as trans in school, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2495.7799999999997s)]
*  where you get like eight, nine kids that just all in a friend group identify as trans. And she's like, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2500.98s)]
*  there is a very distinct possibility that this is a social contagion and that this is, that there are [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2506.74s)]
*  without denying that some people are trans, because there are, but it's like, how do you know now? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2512.9s)]
*  Because this is one of those incredibly bizarre human issues where it's open to interpretation. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2518.34s)]
*  Like this guy or woman, whatever, with the giant rubber boobs can just say that they are a woman [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2524.58s)]
*  and everyone has to back off. Because of that, because of a lack of an ability to prove something, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2532.02s)]
*  now you're in this area where it's open to how someone feels. And that you could just decide, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2538.98s)]
*  well, that's how you get male prisoners who go into female prisons and impregnate inmates, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2546.26s)]
*  which is so crazy. That's how you get male athletes who want to compete in women's sports. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2554.66s)]
*  And when the women complain, they get kicked off the team and forced out of the locker room, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2561.38s)]
*  which we're seeing, which is nuts because it's just how you feel. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2567.38s)]
*  I talked with Carla Esparza recently about this issue specifically, and I just gave her great [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2574.02s)]
*  credit because she has been and continues to be very outspoken about how dangerous it is, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2581.1400000000003s)]
*  especially in mixed martial arts, to have biological males competing against biological females. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2587.94s)]
*  She grew up competing on the boys' wrestling team in high school because there was no girls' team. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2593.54s)]
*  At that age, even, she was just like, yeah, I experienced the unfairness of it because, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2600.3399999999997s)]
*  obviously, these boys are built very differently. She's like, I'm stronger than the average [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2605.54s)]
*  girl my size, but still, I couldn't compete at a level playing field. And then you take that [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2609.3799999999997s)]
*  forward to mixed martial arts. I know you've talked about this a lot about how actually dangerous it [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2615.2999999999997s)]
*  is, but the fact that it takes a whole lot of courage for a female UFC champion to speak out [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2619.54s)]
*  and say, hey, no, biological males should not be competing against biological females, that's an [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2626.9s)]
*  act of courage in this society rather than just like, yeah, of course, she's stating fact, it's [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2632.5s)]
*  truth. But this is the problem is when you have this, it's the Democratic Party leadership, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2637.86s)]
*  it's the progressive left that is so ideologically zealous about this cause because it's the cause [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2644.58s)]
*  today, tomorrow it'll be something else. They create this culture of fear that there will be [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2655.46s)]
*  consequences towards those who differ and also that they just don't believe in truth. And so, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2659.78s)]
*  whatever they say is true today is true today. Whatever they say is true tomorrow is true tomorrow. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2668.1800000000003s)]
*  But the danger of that is you take away all the boundaries of what is true and what is false. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2673.54s)]
*  You take away the boundaries of the things that science actually does prove. And what are we [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2678.9s)]
*  left with then? We have no foundation and then we end up where we're at. Like, okay, well, today [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2684.66s)]
*  we're going to promote pedophiles. That's what we're going to promote. Today, we're going to [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2689.54s)]
*  push books in public schools, kindergarten, first grade, third grade, fifth grade, that are causing [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2695.3s)]
*  your child to say, well, I don't know if I'm a boy or I don't know if I'm a girl. I saw some [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2702.42s)]
*  of these books that some of the parents in Virginia and other states are protesting [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2706.34s)]
*  at their boards of education trying to get these books removed from their kids' schools. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2712.58s)]
*  These books, like I thought, okay, how bad can it be? I saw them and they are some of the most [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2718.1s)]
*  graphic images I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, including oral sex. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2724.5s)]
*  Including oral sex. And this is targeted towards 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2729.22s)]
*  It's so strange that we've gone this far, like into cuckoo land and that it's happened so quickly. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2735.2999999999997s)]
*  It seems like it's happened so quickly, but that's where if we actually stop and think about it, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2740.58s)]
*  it has been very intentional and the groundwork has been laid over time. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2745.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you think it's intentional, like planned out, or do you think that there is an ideology that [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2751.8599999999997s)]
*  gets accepted and then that ideology, it's like a forest fire. It feeds off new fuel so it has to [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2757.14s)]
*  expand its boundaries. I think it's probably a combination of both. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2764.66s)]
*  So if it is intentional, whose intention is it to spread this? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2769.62s)]
*  People who, I mean, it's the very same people who are doing it now, I think, over time, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2776.1s)]
*  trying to see how far they can push the sexualization of our kids in our society. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2782.74s)]
*  I don't know exactly who the person is or the group is or whatever, but [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2793.3799999999997s)]
*  we can't have gotten to this place by accident. Why not? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2798.18s)]
*  Because it's happened so methodically and so quickly over time. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2803.62s)]
*  But if it's a mind virus, which is what I think it is, and I think that these [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2808.02s)]
*  ideological perspectives that are not grounded in reality get accepted by people and then they [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2814.34s)]
*  promote it. These people are promoting it without any conversation with some cabal of evil leaders. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2818.74s)]
*  It's clear there's a mechanism in play and that mechanism is very easy to follow. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2825.3s)]
*  You could see where it starts in universities. You could also see that in these universities, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2830.18s)]
*  these people that are promoting these things and teaching children also grew up in the university [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2837.38s)]
*  system themselves and most of them don't have any real world experience. They have experience [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2844.5s)]
*  going from being in a university to teaching in a university and then promoting these ideologies [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2849.38s)]
*  that are preposterous to the rest of the world as if they're smarter than the rest of the world and [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2855.46s)]
*  then that keeps spreading. It needs more fuel so it keeps moving further and further to the left [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2861.14s)]
*  and further and further into crazy land. But I think just by observing that, just by observing [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2867.3799999999997s)]
*  the fact that these people that are promoting these things, they're not being paid to do it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2874.18s)]
*  They're stuck in this mind virus and this woke mind virus, this ideological mind virus, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2879.46s)]
*  is trackable. You could see it and you could see how it infects people. I've seen it infect people. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2886.42s)]
*  I had this guy on the podcast, his name's Adam Conover and he has a show, Adam Questions [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2893.1400000000003s)]
*  Everything or Adam Ruins Everything. I don't know if you've ever seen it. We got into the subject [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2898.1800000000003s)]
*  of trans people in sports and his position was the most far left, far woke. I just think it would be [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2902.02s)]
*  great to be inclusive and this and that. I go, why do women have a specific category? Why can't men [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2910.58s)]
*  compete against women? That's where the record skips because obviously there's differences. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2916.42s)]
*  What are the differences between a trans woman and a biological woman? They're pretty fucking [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2925.54s)]
*  significant. They're huge. If you want to actually study science, if you have the science of that, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2929.7s)]
*  it's trackable. You could see it. When it comes to the mind virus, people don't ever want to accept [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2936.98s)]
*  that reality. They want to go, inclusivity. They say the words. They just say these words you're [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2943.7s)]
*  supposed to say or you get attacked. They're terrified of being attacked. These are people [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2951.86s)]
*  who, as you said, they're not connected to reality, don't have any personal experience. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2957.06s)]
*  I was shocked when I saw Megan Rapinoe basically say, I don't know what her statement was, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2964.7400000000002s)]
*  but basically it was like, yeah, there's no real difference. Like, okay, well, you already won your [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2970.34s)]
*  Olympic gold. Got it. So are you saying that you could have gone and won that gold competing [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2975.5400000000004s)]
*  against men on the soccer field? I have a friend who's a gay guy who's a powerlifter and he was [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2982.1800000000003s)]
*  upset that people were upset that trans women want to compete as women. And I was like, dude, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2988.1000000000004s)]
*  out of all the fucking people, you're a giant ass powerlifter, dude. Out of all the giant people [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2992.66s)]
*  that, or all the people rather, that know there's a difference between biological males and females, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=2998.8999999999996s)]
*  it should be you. But in that LBGT, whatever the other extra words are, there's a lot more now. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3002.5s)]
*  There's like a plus in there. What's the plus? I think it's like the equivalent of et cetera. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3008.42s)]
*  Anybody else? Furries. It's like L-G-B-T-Q-I-A. And don't ask me what they all stand for because [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3016.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't really know. And then it's the plus at the end. What could the I be? Is it intersex? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3021.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. What's the A? Asexual. Well, you don't even have a fucking dog in the... I'm actually guessing. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3027.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm actually guessing. I don't know. It could be something else. But if you're asexual, stay the [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3033.8599999999997s)]
*  fuck out of it. How is asexual lumped in there with gay men? Because gay men are the most non-asexual [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3037.3799999999997s)]
*  people alive. All they're doing is having sex. Like the fact that the asexuals... [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3046.1s)]
*  Hey, I'm not even in this conversation, man. Leave me out of it. Is it asexual? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3051.06s)]
*  Yeah, it is. The fact that gay men get lumped in with lesbians is like... Lesbians and gay men [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3056.18s)]
*  don't necessarily get along that well because of that reason. Gay men are pretty fucking sexual. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3062.2599999999998s)]
*  And then you get down to asexual and then it's in the same group. And third, I mean, gay and lesbian [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3066.58s)]
*  friends of mine don't get on with the whole trans activism part either. I mean, this is not one... [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3072.98s)]
*  What do you call it? Like monolithic group. Well, they have to publicly support that because [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3079.78s)]
*  of that whole group. This whole lumping in of everyone together. That's why a lot of gay [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3085.86s)]
*  and lesbians support that. But a lot of them, if you talk to them, specifically in my conversations [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3093.22s)]
*  with lesbian women, that lesbians have a real hard time with trans women entering into what is [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3100.98s)]
*  in their mind, feminist spaces and then running things. And running things like a man and running [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3109.86s)]
*  things with threats and with aggression and insults and treating people the way biological men [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3115.62s)]
*  tend to treat people when they're behaving at their worst. And that's a real giant issue [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3124.5s)]
*  because if you're a woman and you're a feminist, you're supposed to be ideologically left, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3129.86s)]
*  you know, maybe even like far left in some of their eyes. And now all of a sudden you get [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3136.1s)]
*  lumped in with something you completely disagree with. Yeah. Before I left Congress, I introduced [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3141.46s)]
*  a bill called the Protect Women's Sports Act. What is a woman? Exactly. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3148.1800000000003s)]
*  I am a woman. Just to make that clear. Congratulations. I could be one too. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3153.3s)]
*  I'm going to put myself out there and disagree wholeheartedly with that, Joe Rogan. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3170.6600000000003s)]
*  You are a bigot. I can't believe it. I know. You know. I've been called worst things. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3175.7s)]
*  We introduced this legislation. I introduced it with a Republican friend of mine named Mark [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3182.5s)]
*  Wayne Mullen from Oklahoma. And he's got six kids, three of them are little girls. All of his kids [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3185.7799999999997s)]
*  wrestle. And the bill was very, very simple in upholding the original intent of Title IX. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3192.5s)]
*  And just explain Title IX to people. Title IX was passed, gosh, I think in the 70s, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3199.4599999999996s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken. And it was a huge landmark piece of legislation because it delineated, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3206.18s)]
*  it provided a level playing field on the basis of sex, meaning males have opportunities, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3214.8199999999997s)]
*  females deserve those same opportunities, whether it be in sports or in college, in [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3221.22s)]
*  and in all public funded in a public funding realm, essentially the where the federal [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3229.3799999999997s)]
*  government can impact it. It said there has to be a level playing field and equal opportunities. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3234.66s)]
*  So people like my mom who grew up, she's very athletic. The only thing that was available to [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3239.22s)]
*  her in high school was was cheerleading. And she did it. She was great. But she would have liked [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3242.8199999999997s)]
*  the opportunity to be able to compete in other sports. Carlos Barza, I think, is is a more, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3247.14s)]
*  you know, modern day example. There were no girls wrestling teams in her high school. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3251.14s)]
*  She got a scholarship to wrestle in college on a girls team. And obviously she has gone on to do [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3256.42s)]
*  amazing things. So Title IX was created recognizing that difference on the basis of sex. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3261.78s)]
*  Democrats have championed Title IX and talked about this great accomplishment and passing [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3272.5s)]
*  this legislation for decades. And that's where it makes no sense. So our legislation basically [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3278.34s)]
*  just said, hey, we want to uphold the original intent of Title IX in recognizing the biological [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3284.1s)]
*  differences between males and females. Period. They should not be competing against each other. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3288.98s)]
*  The legislation didn't move forward for obvious reasons. We were excoriated for having the audacity [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3296.8199999999997s)]
*  to uphold the original intent of Title IX. And now what we're seeing with the Biden administration [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3303.86s)]
*  is administratively, not even through passing legislation, they're trying to backdoor this move [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3311.54s)]
*  to change the rules around Title IX to include gender identity rather than having it be on the [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3316.98s)]
*  basis of biological sex, to include gender identity and threatening schools that they will withhold [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3323.62s)]
*  federal funding unless they adopt this rule change within the Biden administration. Again, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3329.62s)]
*  not running through Congress, not allowing the people's voices to be heard, but trying to backdoor [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3336.18s)]
*  this through and making threats to publicly funded educational institutions as a means of [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3340.5s)]
*  trying to implement this. Now, why do you think they're doing that? And is that publicly supported? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3348.98s)]
*  Because the only thing that makes sense is politically they would do that because that [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3354.5s)]
*  would help them in terms of an election. Why else would they do that? There are polls that have been [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3360.98s)]
*  done that show not only a majority of Americans disagree with this, but also a majority of [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3368.02s)]
*  Democrats disagree with this. And so why they're doing it, they're catering to those ideological [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3374.34s)]
*  zealots within the Democratic Party and trying to placate them in their radical policies and their [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3384.42s)]
*  extremes rather than actually standing up and saying, you know what, no, this is science, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3393.3s)]
*  this is biology, and this is what's right. And oh, by the way, it would also be politically [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3399.46s)]
*  beneficial given where the vast majority of Democrats and Americans are on this. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3406.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's just wild that no one's pushing back. It's really wild, especially no one in the [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3411.6200000000003s)]
*  Democratic Party. They seem like they're captive by the furthest left. And that doesn't make any [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3417.94s)]
*  sense to me because if the majority of Democrats, and I agree with that, the majority of people that [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3425.06s)]
*  I know that are on the left don't think it's fair, why are they doing it then? Because that seems like [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3430.02s)]
*  that would be an unpopular position, not just an unpopular position, but horribly unpopular for [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3434.82s)]
*  people that have daughters that compete in sports. Like if you're a daughter and you're competing in [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3439.94s)]
*  that Connecticut track and field team where those two biological males are breaking world records, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3444.5s)]
*  that's crazy. At what point in time do you not understand you're denying a child [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3449.38s)]
*  a fair future? You're denying them a potential scholarship where they could go to a university [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3455.94s)]
*  and pursue an education. You're fucking them up because of this thing that doesn't even affect [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3461.86s)]
*  you. You're just doing it for this cult-like ideological perspective. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3468.58s)]
*  Exactly. And that's the danger of it is the people in charge of the Democratic Party, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3473.94s)]
*  whether they actually hold positions or they just are influential in the Democratic Party, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3479.7s)]
*  have created this cult-like atmosphere and fomented this fear so much so that people who are [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3484.98s)]
*  really in a position to impact this, to stand up against and say, hold on guys, this is literally [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3491.7s)]
*  insane and needs to stop, they're too afraid to do so because of what the ramifications will be. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3497.22s)]
*  The Democratic Party of the past, the Democratic Party that I joined doesn't exist anymore. The [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3506.4199999999996s)]
*  party that was the party of JFK, of Dr. Martin Luther King, the party of inclusivity, the big [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3511.2999999999997s)]
*  tent party that welcomed and encouraged this marketplace of ideas and conversations and people [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3518.66s)]
*  who held different views, the party of the championed women and equality and the rights of [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3524.1s)]
*  people in our society, that party just, it doesn't exist anymore. And instead we have a party that's [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3531.46s)]
*  being led by people who have gone insane with this ideological fanaticism. And there are a lot of [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3537.06s)]
*  different issues, a lot of different examples, the whole issue of biology and the trans issue is just [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3547.86s)]
*  one of them. There are so many different others. You don't have a right to raise your kids now, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3554.9s)]
*  you don't have a right to say what they're being taught in schools now, the state, the government, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3559.94s)]
*  the teachers unions, only they have that right and responsibility. They're undermining families, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3564.1800000000003s)]
*  they don't believe in the rule of law, defund the police, the Supreme Court, we don't agree with [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3570.34s)]
*  them so they're illegitimate. There's so many different examples of these ideologues who have [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3574.98s)]
*  taken control of the democratic party, who don't actually care about the people. It's all about [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3584.26s)]
*  themselves, their power and their maintaining control. And that's the real threat to our [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3589.46s)]
*  democracy that they pose is they don't believe in freedom of speech, they don't believe in freedom [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3594.82s)]
*  of thought, they don't believe in freedom of religion. All they believe in is you've got to [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3600.1s)]
*  buy into whatever they're selling at any given day. And like I said, not only it's not enough [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3604.34s)]
*  to agree, you've got to go out there, you've got to march in the parade, you've got to carry the sign, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3611.38s)]
*  you've got to scream and yell, and don't you dare even think about talking to Republicans. Don't [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3616.5s)]
*  even think about working with Republicans because that directly undermines their authority. And [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3623.06s)]
*  frankly, Joe, this is something that I've been trying to fight against within the democratic [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3631.06s)]
*  party back when I was vice chair of the DNC for years. And it's gotten to a point where [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3636.9s)]
*  those who have been in charge for a long time remain in charge, are not willing to change. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3646.42s)]
*  And so I'm leaving the democratic party. Is that this big announcement? Yeah. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3654.18s)]
*  You're leaving the democratic party. I'm leaving the democratic party because [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3661.06s)]
*  I've tried to enact that change from within. I don't see the democratic party as being [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3665.06s)]
*  savable. And I know that I can make an impact more from the outside. And frankly, I just, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3672.74s)]
*  I can't be associated and stand by this insanity that's been going on and continues [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3681.2999999999997s)]
*  to worsen day by day. Are you going to be an independent? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3686.9s)]
*  Yep. So that's what you're moving forward. Yep. What is it about this country that is so [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3689.7000000000003s)]
*  politically married to having two teams and two teams only? And how do we fix that? Because [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3696.7400000000002s)]
*  there is very little room for someone who's a third party candidate to be taken seriously in [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3703.3s)]
*  this country. And when you do vote for a libertarian, you do vote for an independent, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3709.86s)]
*  many people think of it as a protest vote. Spoiler. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3715.14s)]
*  Yeah. Or at the very least you say, you know, that's why I voted for Joe Jorgensen. That is [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3718.2599999999998s)]
*  me personally why I did. Because I was like, this, I'm not voting for him and I'm not voting for her. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3724.3399999999997s)]
*  Fuck this. And then I'm not voting or that was with this one, it was Biden actually. But that [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3729.22s)]
*  was also why I was voting for Gary Johnson. It was like, I'm not voting for her and I'm not voting [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3733.2999999999997s)]
*  for him. I'll vote for that guy if he doesn't know where Aleppo is. Like, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3737.3799999999997s)]
*  that's right. I forgot about that. But I don't live. That wasn't that big of a deal to me. That [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3741.7s)]
*  to me was like, it seems like, I mean, it was a big deal at the time, but it seems like so minor [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3747.94s)]
*  now compared to, you know, our vice president standing at the DMZ saying we are great allies [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3752.5s)]
*  with North Korea. What a fuck up that was. And that didn't even make the news. People barely [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3759.62s)]
*  talked about it. Exactly. Our great partnership with North Korea. Like what? North Korea? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3765.38s)]
*  She didn't even stand there and be like, I'm sorry, I misspoke. Right. No. Well, sometimes people, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3772.7400000000002s)]
*  like you don't realize, I do that all the time. Like Jamie will correct me all the time. I'll say [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3778.1800000000003s)]
*  something that I thought, I thought I'd said another thing. Right. He's like, you said that. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3782.9s)]
*  I go, oh, did I? Oh, I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing. Right. Because you just, it's [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3786.02s)]
*  just a flub. Yeah. I haven't, I guess, I guess the problem is it comes in a long line of [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3789.94s)]
*  flubs. She's terrible. She is absolutely terrible. And that is for you, that is where like everything [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3796.7400000000002s)]
*  sort of soured with you and the Democratic Party was when during the debates where you [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3805.94s)]
*  accurately pointed out her record. Yeah. And you, you, you basically sank any hope that she had of [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3811.7799999999997s)]
*  being president because you opened up this discussion that many people are not aware of [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3820.02s)]
*  about a prosecution record and the things that she's done that are absolutely illegal. Yeah. Like [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3824.98s)]
*  forcing people to work as labor, as cheap labor for the state to fight wildfires after they're [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3829.22s)]
*  supposed to be released. Exactly. They did their time. They did their time and she kept them in [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3834.2599999999998s)]
*  prison to use them essentially as slave labor for the state, putting their own lives at risk forcibly. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3839.46s)]
*  The thing about my exchange with her on that debate stage, when you take a step back, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3847.14s)]
*  you got a question like all of those things I brought up on her record, easily Googleable on [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3856.5s)]
*  the first page. When you look at Kamala Harris's record, all of those things, I'd have to dig very [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3862.82s)]
*  deep to see what those issues and problems were with her record. So then the question is, Hey, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3867.22s)]
*  why didn't, why didn't anybody in the media ask her these questions about the record that she said, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3873.14s)]
*  I'm so proud of my record as this and as that is that. All right, cool. Talk about this. This is [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3877.2999999999997s)]
*  your record. Talk about these things. No one in the media did that. There's no other candidate [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3882.74s)]
*  on the debate stage who had the balls to bring that up. How, how, how are voters supposed to be [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3888.02s)]
*  able to make their best informed decision when the media and fellow democratic candidates who are [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3895.54s)]
*  running, who are her opponents in that race don't have the courage to ask a very factual question [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3902.9s)]
*  on a record that she says she's proud of? Do you think that there's a concerted effort to [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3910.1s)]
*  hide that information or do you think that people recognize that that, that that's, that's a trap? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3914.66s)]
*  Like if I do that, then it's going to fuck up my future. They're going to not want me to participate [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3921.7s)]
*  in certain things, which most certainly happened to you. Yes, that most certainly happened. And, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3927.94s)]
*  and that shows the double standard. I, you know, I don't know why no one had the courage to ask her [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3932.66s)]
*  those questions, why I was the first person to do it. If I had to guess, I would imagine it's [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3938.42s)]
*  because she's got friends in high places. I would guess it's because she's a, she's a woman of color [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3943.7799999999997s)]
*  and no one wants to be seen as the person attacking a woman of color who's running for [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3949.78s)]
*  president. They got no issues attacking me on a whole host of fronts, but because again, she, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3953.86s)]
*  she was connected, she's playing the game. She's somebody that the democratic party knows that they [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3961.78s)]
*  can control. And that was the thing for me is, and it started years before I ran for president, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3967.6200000000003s)]
*  is once the democratic, I went to, got elected to Congress and they were like, oh, she's the first [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3973.3s)]
*  this, she's the first that she's cool. She's going to be one of us. We'll put her forward and, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3977.78s)]
*  you know, she'll be a great new face of the democratic party, all these things. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3982.34s)]
*  But then very quickly they realized like, I mean, I've always been an independent Democrat. Every [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3986.1000000000004s)]
*  race that I've ever run, whether it was for city council in Honolulu or for the state legislature, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3991.86s)]
*  for Congress, I was never like the party pick ever. I never won any of those races with the [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=3996.26s)]
*  democratic party saying, all right, hey, we're going to back you up. We're going to send you [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4003.0600000000004s)]
*  money. We're going to send the troops out to support you. None of that. It was always been [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4006.5s)]
*  truly grassroots campaign of the people, which is amazing. They found out very quickly like, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4011.54s)]
*  okay, she's not somebody that, you know, the puppet masters can control. She's not just going [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4016.98s)]
*  to read the talking points when she goes on TV or stands on the house floor. And, and that's where [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4021.3s)]
*  things started to take a turn where those who are in those positions of power said, okay, she's [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4026.98s)]
*  somebody who could expose our weaknesses, expose our insecurities, expose the hypocrisies in our [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4035.14s)]
*  arguments and, and started to create that distance and then resorted to the smear and the discrediting [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4042.3399999999997s)]
*  and the attacks and then ultimately like total media blackouts. It's amazing when I talk to [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4048.74s)]
*  people and it happened recently with Alex Barron. And he was like, isn't she crazy? I'm like, what's [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4054.8199999999997s)]
*  crazy? How's she crazy? Tell me how she's crazy. And then no examples. I'm like, well, why are you [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4059.62s)]
*  saying that? Like, why does someone say he's like, ah, you actually, you're right. Like I don't have [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4064.74s)]
*  an example. I'm like, isn't that weird that you just like have your and he's a journalist. I mean, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4070.18s)]
*  work for the New York Times and it just isn't she crazy. Yep. Yep. Accepting that. And that's how [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4075.2999999999997s)]
*  they do it. Wild. That's how they do it is, is like, Hey, let's just plant a seed of doubt or [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4081.14s)]
*  suspicion so that most people, I mean, as a journalist, he's got no excuse, but most people [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4086.1s)]
*  don't have just, I mean, honestly, they don't have the time. They hear one thing. They're like, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4092.74s)]
*  shoot, like I got kids, I got work, we got soccer games, we got this, we got that. And you want me [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4098.0199999999995s)]
*  to do research, like, wait, what? Right. And you want me to do research from multiple different [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4103.139999999999s)]
*  platforms so that I get an unbiased perspective or at least an objective perspective based on [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4108.5s)]
*  multiple sources of information. But it's like, it's such a bizarre system that we have and it's [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4115.78s)]
*  so easy to rig because there's only two parties and both parties are controlled by these gigantic [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4125.3s)]
*  special interest groups, gigantic special interest groups, corporate for profit media, big tech, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4132.179999999999s)]
*  and then the powers in both parties. And that's where I'm glad you use the word rig because [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4141.22s)]
*  it's an important word. And usually when you use it, people aren't thinking of it in the way that [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4149.38s)]
*  we're talking about. It's what I experienced during that campaign is that collusion between [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4154.66s)]
*  those very, very powerful entities to decide before voters even get a chance to be exposed [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4160.5s)]
*  to different candidates to choose from, they decide, all right, here are the candidate, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4166.34s)]
*  here's the people that we're going to, you know, we think will be all right. We think they're going [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4170.18s)]
*  to play the game and we'll promote them. We'll say nice things about them, maybe throw in a tough [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4173.62s)]
*  question here or there just to not blow our cover. But these are the people that we want voters to [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4178.5s)]
*  choose from. And these other people are the ones that we're going to try to either just slide into [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4182.42s)]
*  the darkness and hope nobody notices them. Or if people are noticing them, we're going to do [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4187.9400000000005s)]
*  everything that we can to smear them and undermine their credibility so that when they do speak, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4193.54s)]
*  you get that kind of reaction from Berenson. Did you notice an immediate change in the way [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4200.34s)]
*  people communicated with you before that debate versus after that debate? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4207.54s)]
*  That was one of the factors. That was one of the factors. The interesting thing to me was that I [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4215.22s)]
*  heard from some friends who were sitting kind of in the green rooms and backstage for some of the [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4222.9s)]
*  major cable networks at that moment, live when it happened on the debate stage, there was a whole [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4227.86s)]
*  bunch of people cheering and like, holy crap, that just happened. But probably within an hour, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4234.74s)]
*  maybe 30 minutes of the debate being finished and going into the media room where they, you know, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4244.42s)]
*  you've got the post debate, all the interviews and all those things happening, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4250.820000000001s)]
*  immediately it was like, okay, no, we've got to change the narrative because we can't allow that [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4253.9400000000005s)]
*  to stick. Is there any courting of you by the Republican Party? Not that I know of. You have [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4258.740000000001s)]
*  no interest? No, no. I mean, look, the Republican Party, I mean, what is the Republican Party today? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4270.02s)]
*  You know, I've got Republican friends who don't like to be associated with each other [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4276.42s)]
*  because they're in different factions of the Republican Party. I think that, you know, when [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4283.78s)]
*  you look at the two, I think there's potential there for that party. That's the Republican Party [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4291.46s)]
*  has kind of turned more towards populism and actually fighting for working people. It's a, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4297.38s)]
*  you look at a recent vote that was taken, you know, on the issue of foreign policy and war and [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4305.54s)]
*  peace. The Republican Party had like, I think it was 50 members of Congress voted against that [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4310.58s)]
*  massive multi-billion dollar funding package for Ukraine and have been saying, hey, we shouldn't [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4318.179999999999s)]
*  be waging this proxy war against Russia, or at least we need to have a debate or accountability. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4325.54s)]
*  Zero Democrats voted against that. So you look at, you know, the Democratic Party that used to [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4331.7s)]
*  have people who, you know, protested the Vietnam War and others. Now, I mean, the Democratic Party [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4336.98s)]
*  leadership is very strongly within the grips of the military industrial complex and advocating for [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4343.139999999999s)]
*  more war and you have more Republicans. And I think even Trump, this was Trump's instinct when [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4350.58s)]
*  he ran for president and he was president was like, hey, we shouldn't be going and being the [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4355.7s)]
*  policeman of the world. We shouldn't be going around the world and starting all these wars. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4360.98s)]
*  I think the problem with him was he surrounded himself with people who held a diametrically [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4365.379999999999s)]
*  opposed view. You know, Mike Pompeo, Nikki Haley, John Bolton, people who never saw a war they [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4371.139999999999s)]
*  didn't like and advocated for. So there's movement. There's movement happening within [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4379.86s)]
*  the Democratic Party. Leadership is going crazy. I think the Republican Party is, I don't know, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4387.9400000000005s)]
*  I think they're trying to figure out what they're doing. Yeah. I mean, I think if they had someone [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4393.86s)]
*  like Ron DeSantis, who seems to be like the most reasonable amongst the potential candidates, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4400.1s)]
*  he seems to be, you know, a pretty no-nonsense guy, not without his flaws, but he's more reasonable [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4405.7s)]
*  than anything that I'm seeing on the left. Yeah. At least with his, the way he handled COVID. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4414.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's just, it's one of those things where as it's all playing out, there's [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4419.78s)]
*  this sense of hopelessness because there's not like a clearly defined path where this country's [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4425.78s)]
*  ship gets righted. It's like, I just see a lot of chaos and a lot of confusion and a lot of [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4433.86s)]
*  infighting and I don't know how this plays out. It doesn't seem like there's a real clear, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4440.42s)]
*  oh, this is our path to sanity. You're right. And I think the first step towards that path though is [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4448.9800000000005s)]
*  people recognizing what the insanity is and the problems. And I think that more and more [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4457.9400000000005s)]
*  these things are coming to light. I can tell you, I mean, I know there are a lot of Democrats that [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4468.9800000000005s)]
*  feel the same kind of frustration that I feel with the Democratic Party leadership. Often quietly. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4474.5s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. There's a lot of quiet disagreement where people are just like, I'm not voting for [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4481.3s)]
*  Trump, but what the fuck are we doing? Right. And I think there's that in the Republican Party as [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4485.62s)]
*  well. And so I think that that creates opportunity for us as a country to get out of just this [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4492.42s)]
*  two-party system mindset and this mindset of fear that drives so many of the elections where instead [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4503.46s)]
*  of saying like, hey, I'm running for president because this is how I'm offering to lead the [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4510.9s)]
*  country. This is how I'm offering to serve the country. Here are the things that I'll do. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4517.14s)]
*  Instead of that, we are kind of relegated to, hey, vote for me or vote for my party because the [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4520.1s)]
*  other guy's the devil. Right. And really treating voters like we're idiots and we don't care or [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4529.06s)]
*  have the intelligence to actually look at, okay, here's where you stand on this issue. Here's where [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4539.54s)]
*  this other person stands on this issue. I'm going to make my decision not based on party, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4544.42s)]
*  but actually based on, hey, who best reflects my values? Who is actually going to put the country [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4549.860000000001s)]
*  first, the interests of the American people and the country first? And not just the people who [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4556.740000000001s)]
*  say the words, but the people who actually have the record and the policies to back that up. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4560.42s)]
*  And so I hope that this is the direction that we're moving in as more and more people get [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4567.62s)]
*  disillusioned with leaders in both parties who care more about their own political ambitions [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4574.18s)]
*  and their own party's power than they actually do care about the American people. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4583.22s)]
*  It seems like part of the problem is that that attack style of politics works. Like just think [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4588.18s)]
*  about someone saying, oh, she's crazy. Like, okay, how is she crazy? But that's a narrative. And it [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4595.22s)]
*  gets out there because they attacked you. So that stuff works. That's what's unfortunate [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4600.66s)]
*  is that instead of to make it like if there was an incentive to say these are our plans and this [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4605.86s)]
*  is how we can implement this and just ignore negativity on the other side. This is what I [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4613.22s)]
*  want to do. And I think that we are the best hope for the American people moving forward. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4617.22s)]
*  Yeah. You know, when I was running for president at town halls that we held across the country, [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4621.38s)]
*  it didn't really matter where we were, whether it was a small town or a big city, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4628.66s)]
*  middle America, East Coast, West Coast. One of the things that one of the media embedded [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4632.099999999999s)]
*  reporters that would kind of follow us around everywhere we went said made an observation that [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4640.82s)]
*  I thought was pretty awesome. This reporter said, gosh, you know, I go to all these different [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4646.0199999999995s)]
*  campaign and candidate events. Yours is the only one where people walk out feeling hopeful [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4652.26s)]
*  and feeling inspired. And we had Democrats, Republicans and independents and libertarians [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4659.46s)]
*  at every single one of those. And it was because we talked about different issues. We talked about [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4664.5s)]
*  you know, the threat of nuclear war. We talked about this new Cold War, the dangers of continuing [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4672.34s)]
*  down this path. We talked about things that they education. We talked about how we actually talked [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4678.9s)]
*  about these things. Most days I never brought up Trump because why I'm running and I'm asking you, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4683.46s)]
*  hey, let me have the opportunity to serve you. And here's what we will do. Whereas with these [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4690.98s)]
*  other candidates, these other Democrat candidates who were running, people left angry. People left [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4696.259999999999s)]
*  angry. And that was their only goal was like, hey, how many lines against Trump can we use [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4702.82s)]
*  that we know are going to piss people off and motivate them through anger and fear rather than [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4708.5s)]
*  through hope and inspiration for what we can do together as a country? That's the direction [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4715.299999999999s)]
*  that we need that we need to go. And there are a lot of things that are issues that are of concern. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4723.62s)]
*  And treating people with respect and like they have intelligence and actually tackling those issues, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4730.9800000000005s)]
*  breaking through and being able to deliver that message to the American people I think is the [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4739.860000000001s)]
*  challenge. I think people want it. But the media does a really great job of kind of reducing [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4743.860000000001s)]
*  things to their lowest kind of standard. Do you think that the biggest challenge or one of the [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4750.9800000000005s)]
*  I should just rephrase that. One of the biggest challenges I believe is the influence of money. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4759.54s)]
*  And when you look at one of the Dave Smith was on the podcast recently and we went over the [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4766.42s)]
*  defense budget and I had no idea it was that much. It's such an insane amount of money. How [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4773.7s)]
*  can decisions be made that are not influenced by that money? When you're talking about whatever [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4783.78s)]
*  the what was it? $1.7 trillion? That is a preposterously huge amount of money per year. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4790.74s)]
*  That was the 2022 budget apparently. What can be done to remove money from the equation of [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4798.18s)]
*  doing the right thing, doing the safe thing, doing the thing that's going to secure the future of [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4809.94s)]
*  America and put us in a good direction? It seems like money is so inexorably tied to all the [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4816.66s)]
*  political decisions that get made in this country, particularly when it has to do with foreign policy. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4823.139999999999s)]
*  When you're talking about and you have been a very outspoken critic of interventionist [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4828.58s)]
*  foreign policy and wars that are unnecessary and that put lives in danger and cost incredible [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4834.26s)]
*  amounts of money but enrich the coffers of all these corporations. And that undermine our own [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4842.26s)]
*  interests and security interests. Yes. And this is exactly what Eisenhower warned of when he was [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4848.02s)]
*  leaving office. Exactly. The military industrial complex. I mean that is such a nefarious term [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4853.06s)]
*  and to most people it's sort of abstract. You hear that term, the military industrial complex. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4859.38s)]
*  If you go to the average person in this treaty, even a well-educated person, define that. What [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4865.06s)]
*  does that mean? How do they affect policy and change? What's the defense budget? How much money [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4868.5s)]
*  are we talking about? So with things like funding the Ukraine war with Russia, please explain to [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4874.5s)]
*  people what that means and why we're sending so much money over to Ukraine. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4881.62s)]
*  So let's start with that. Let's start with the military industrial complex. What is it? Who is [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4891.0599999999995s)]
*  it? It is these massive defense corporations who make all these different weapons systems from the [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4895.94s)]
*  smallest to the most powerful nuclear weapons and missiles. When we are at war, they make a lot of [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4905.3s)]
*  money. When politicians, even if we're not at war but are threatening that we may go to war, they [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4913.38s)]
*  make a lot of money. And these decisions are not made within the context of, hey, what does our [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4921.14s)]
*  military actually need? What do we need to ensure that our military is ready to defend our country [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4926.74s)]
*  and our national security interests? It is very often what members of Congress are advocating for, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4934.42s)]
*  even more than the military is asking for sometimes because of those cozy relationships [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4941.62s)]
*  with the military industrial complex, with these massive defense contractors and their lobbyists. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4948.34s)]
*  So there's a direct correlation as the money is changing hands there. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4953.38s)]
*  The problem is not with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party. On this issue, when you see [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4959.22s)]
*  so much divisiveness on tons of other issues facing our country, everything from infrastructure [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4966.5s)]
*  to education, all these other things, you see like, oh my gosh, Democrats and Republicans can't agree [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4972.18s)]
*  on anything. This issue of putting our country in a continual state of war is supported by leaders [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4976.18s)]
*  in both parties and the majority of people in both parties. And it's directly tied to [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4985.86s)]
*  the military industrial complex's influence and tied to people who want to act and look tough [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4990.66s)]
*  but aren't asking the most important questions like, okay, if we do this, will this help the [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=4998.259999999999s)]
*  American people or hurt the American people? If we vote to send these billions of dollars to Ukraine, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5004.58s)]
*  is that strengthening our national security or undermining it? You'll hear a lot of rhetoric, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5013.14s)]
*  especially recently saying, hey, if we've got to send all this money to Ukraine, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5019.780000000001s)]
*  otherwise, Russia's going to come and attack us here. Otherwise, our national security will [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5026.820000000001s)]
*  be undermined. So they say all these things to foment fear in people's minds, but they're not [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5031.860000000001s)]
*  rooted in reality. So what we're seeing play out now is essentially a proxy war. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5036.26s)]
*  US is engaging in a proxy war with Russia using Ukraine as their military. So the US and some [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5045.14s)]
*  European countries, predominantly the US, though, are providing billions of dollars in funding, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5052.02s)]
*  weapon systems and so forth, and essentially waging this war using the Ukrainian military [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5057.22s)]
*  and people as their chess pieces in this geopolitical chess game, the ultimate objective [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5062.9s)]
*  being regime change with Russia. And you can see years before, obviously, Russia's invasion in [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5071.139999999999s)]
*  Ukraine, this anti-Russia sentiment has been building up by the permanent Washington establishment [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5078.339999999999s)]
*  and laying the groundwork. And this was the opportunity that they saw. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5088.02s)]
*  It's put us in the most dangerous position we, the American people, and the world has ever been in, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5093.06s)]
*  in that we, a nuclear war could break out in a week, in 30 days. We are staring over the precipice [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5103.620000000001s)]
*  of that nuclear brink now more than ever before. We're hearing language coming from Putin, from [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5113.06s)]
*  Medvedev, from different Russian nationalist leaders saying, no, Putin, you should go and use [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5120.18s)]
*  those nuclear weapons, whether they're the tactical nukes or the strategic nukes, doesn't matter. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5126.900000000001s)]
*  There is no way to win this. That would spark a nuclear war. It would spark World War Three. And [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5132.18s)]
*  the result of that is destruction of the world. It is destruction of the world as we know it. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5140.66s)]
*  And I hate to paint such a bleak picture, but this is, people need to know that this is the [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5147.86s)]
*  reality that we're facing, that our leaders have pushed us and led us to this brink of nuclear war. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5154.58s)]
*  They have their own bunkers and ways to protect themselves. There is no shelter [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5162.26s)]
*  for the American people. I think it was last time I was here, I talked to you about the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5169.38s)]
*  nuclear scare that we had in Hawaii and how this message went out to everybody saying, hey, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5174.9800000000005s)]
*  missile incoming, seek shelter immediately. This is not a drill. What everybody found out immediately [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5181.46s)]
*  is there is no shelter. There is no shelter. There's no place to go. There's no place where [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5187.78s)]
*  you can take your loved ones and your kids to be protected not only from the blast, but the fallout [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5194.42s)]
*  and the lack of food and water and everything else that comes after. New York City recently put out [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5199.7s)]
*  a PSA, I don't know if you saw it, but it is literally a video ad that they put out saying, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5208.74s)]
*  hey, here's what you do in the event of a nuclear explosion. Why are they putting this out now? [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5214.099999999999s)]
*  Because of where we are as a country. The problem is, as it shows in this video, their advice [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5220.66s)]
*  to the people of New York City is get inside, stay inside, and stay tuned. That's it. Stay tuned to [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5227.46s)]
*  what? The radio, I guess. I mean, what is even going to be available? That's my point. That is [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5235.86s)]
*  exactly my point. There will be no power. There will be no infrastructure. There will be no, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5241.86s)]
*  you see what's happening in Florida right now with the recovery efforts after this hurricane just [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5248.42s)]
*  swept through and demolished it. You think about that and multiply that by like, I don't know, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5254.58s)]
*  50,000 times the devastation is what we would see, but we wouldn't have FEMA. We wouldn't have these [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5258.74s)]
*  first responders who are able to actually go out and help people. And the worst thing, man, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5265.38s)]
*  the worst thing I said when I watched that PSA, get inside, stay inside, stay tuned. At the end, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5269.7s)]
*  I'm assuming as an actor, they hired to do this. She looks in the camera and she's like, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5275.3s)]
*  you got this New York. Like what in the world? These people are creating this false sense of [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5279.860000000001s)]
*  security for the American people saying like, oh yeah, take shelter. But there is no shelter. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5286.74s)]
*  We should watch that because it's so crazy. It is insane. Let's watch that because it's. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5292.42s)]
*  It's. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5297.3s)]
*  So there's been a nuclear attack. Don't ask me how or why, just know that the big one has hit. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5302.74s)]
*  Okay. So what do we do? There are three important steps that I want you to remember. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5308.5s)]
*  Step one, get inside fast. You, your friends, your family, get inside. And no, staying in the car [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5314.820000000001s)]
*  is not an option. You need to get into a building and move away from the windows. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5323.78s)]
*  Look at her smiles. I know. Step two, stay inside, shut all doors and windows, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5329.3s)]
*  have a basement, head there. If you don't have one, get as far into the middle of the building [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5336.9s)]
*  as possible. If you were outside after the blast, get clean immediately, remove and bag all outer [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5342.9s)]
*  clothing to keep radioactive dust or ash away from your body. Step three, stay tuned. Follow [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5351.22s)]
*  media for more information. Don't forget to sign up for Notify NYC for official alerts and updates. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5359.7s)]
*  And don't go outside until officials say it's safe. All right, you've got this. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5367.3s)]
*  She's like, oh my God, shit. Officials like who? Rashida Tlaib? She's going to tell you? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5374.1s)]
*  Like who's the officials? People that they elected? Who? Who's going to tell you it's [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5380.740000000001s)]
*  okay to go outside during a nuclear blast in the United States, something that's never happened [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5385.700000000001s)]
*  ever and that we're completely woefully unprepared for? You got this. You got this. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5390.5s)]
*  She's so pretty though, with your big smile. She's got a nice smile. She's got a great smile. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5395.860000000001s)]
*  That's probably why they hired her. That is a crazy thing to put out there. First of all, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5399.7s)]
*  because what's the purpose of that? Is that to reassure people? What is the purpose of that? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5405.78s)]
*  It's not to inform people because none of what she said makes any sense. Oh, get in the middle [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5412.099999999999s)]
*  of the room? Oh, that's okay. The outside's not good? Just stay away from the window. The middle's [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5416.34s)]
*  not going to be- Because the radiation is not- Just stays, but the radiation, it's kind of like a fog [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5420.179999999999s)]
*  machine. It just doesn't get inside. Like what? I was in, I think it was after my second deployment. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5425.94s)]
*  When I came back from the Middle East, I went on a trip and did some travel through Eastern Europe [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5434.419999999999s)]
*  and went and actually visited Chernobyl. It was astonishing to me even decades after that happened [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5438.98s)]
*  because I was curious. I'd heard about it and it's like, okay. Went on this little bus and went out [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5446.98s)]
*  there. They gave us these radiation monitors, these handheld radiation monitors so that wherever [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5454.58s)]
*  we were, you could kind of test and see where the radiation still existed. They're like, oh, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5461.22s)]
*  you're going to see apple trees and things like that. Don't eat any of the fruit because it's [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5467.3s)]
*  contaminated. It is still contaminated decades later. Walking through the middle of the town, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5473.38s)]
*  I know everyone's seen the pictures and obviously now with that Chernobyl series, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5479.0599999999995s)]
*  I think that Netflix did. More and more people know the story, but [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5483.22s)]
*  walking through the school and the classrooms where the desks and the books and the kids' shoes [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5488.9s)]
*  and the deflated basketballs, everything is still there in the way that it was when people fled and [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5495.7s)]
*  had to evacuate when that nuclear plant melted down. It was so eerie walking through there. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5504.18s)]
*  You could almost kind of feel the heaviness of what happened there. Then as we were leaving [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5513.54s)]
*  after we left and were crossing back into Ukraine, we had to go through these, before we got on the [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5521.7s)]
*  bus, we had to go through these radiation, kind of like the thing you walk through in TSA, except it [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5529.86s)]
*  tests for radiation to make sure you're not actually bringing any contaminants with you back into [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5535.94s)]
*  society. All of that is to say this is what we're talking about. You see that kind of video [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5541.22s)]
*  and you see how completely out of touch it is with the reality of what could happen [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5546.98s)]
*  in the event of a nuclear attack. The fact that Russia's got over 6,000 nuclear warheads, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5553.94s)]
*  United States has over 5,000 nuclear warheads, both countries making up 90% of the total number [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5561.46s)]
*  of nuclear warheads that exist in the world. Literally, it would just take the flick of a [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5567.7s)]
*  match to spark this war off. That's where you hear President Biden say, well, this is Putin's war. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5575.22s)]
*  This is Putin's fault. It's Putin who's the one who's solely responsible. Well, the United States [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5581.86s)]
*  and some of these European NATO countries are fueling this war and need to provide the leadership [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5589.0599999999995s)]
*  to bring about a negotiated outcome. That is exactly what needs to happen here to prevent the [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5597.06s)]
*  destruction of the planet and life as we know it. They're not doing that. And in doing so, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5602.5s)]
*  they are failing the American people and putting us in this position of not knowing where we're [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5611.9400000000005s)]
*  going to be in the event that this kicks off. Do you think that whoever the powers would be, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5619.860000000001s)]
*  and whatever the influence is from the military industrial complex, that they are trying to [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5625.86s)]
*  prolong this in order to profit? So they're trying to continue to fund Ukraine. This gives [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5631.86s)]
*  them an excellent reason to ramp up budgets and keep shipping over weapons and arms. They keep [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5638.98s)]
*  making more and more profit and just get us right to the point where it gets squirrely. Well, Putin [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5646.179999999999s)]
*  won't do it. He won't do it. He won't do it. But if he does it, there's no pulling back from that. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5652.1s)]
*  There's no reason why we would ever get to that point is because people are trying to make more [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5657.860000000001s)]
*  money. That is that is certainly a major driver. I have no doubt about that. I am concerned that [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5662.9800000000005s)]
*  we may have passed that point already. You're talking about people pushing us right up to the [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5671.86s)]
*  line and then just saying, well, the whole theory of nuclear weapons is one of mutually assured [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5683.06s)]
*  destruction. There's no way Putin will ever launch this because of that fear of, OK, well, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5689.86s)]
*  we will all be destroyed if that happens. And they're saying, you know, Putin has many things, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5697.06s)]
*  but he's not crazy. There's no way he's going to do this. Well, they're talking about doing it. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5704.34s)]
*  They change their nuclear weapons policy so that according to their laws, they would be authorized [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5708.660000000001s)]
*  to use a nuclear weapon if they are facing any kind of existential threat, whether it's coming [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5714.820000000001s)]
*  from a nuclear source or not. And you look at the situation that Putin is in right now, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5719.54s)]
*  he's boxed into a corner, he's lost face. He is in a place where he may feel like he has nothing [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5728.98s)]
*  else to lose. And you find that same kind of mentality in people who are suicidal or people [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5740.26s)]
*  who are bullied or people who feel like their best option is a way out. And so to be so dismissive [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5748.5s)]
*  and say, well, you know, Putin's not crazy. He's not going to do this. It denies the reality of the [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5759.62s)]
*  position that he's in. Also, doesn't he have cancer? I don't know. I've read different things [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5768.1s)]
*  about how he's sick. But Oliver Stone said that when he was over there, when he was filming Putin [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5774.74s)]
*  years ago, he had cancer and that he was being treated for cancer back then. And he believes [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5780.179999999999s)]
*  he still has cancer. And there's all these rumors that he has cancer. I mean, if he's terminal [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5786.58s)]
*  and he's slowly dying, that's a terrifying possibility. It is. The other argument, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5793.0599999999995s)]
*  the opposing argument is, hey, if we don't stop Russia now, then they will take over all of Europe [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5804.9800000000005s)]
*  and, you know, come at us and then we'll have to deal with them later. The problem with this is [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5814.34s)]
*  you look at all the intelligence reports and things that were coming out when Russia first [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5821.38s)]
*  was preparing to invade Ukraine and then invaded Ukraine. This is what they were saying, right? Is [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5826.1s)]
*  they're going to do shock and on Ukraine, take all of Ukraine and then move on to, you know, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5830.42s)]
*  other NATO allies and then to the West as a whole. That has all been completely disproven. And the [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5836.9s)]
*  intelligence community failed us as a country with those reports because we've seen how Russia's [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5844.18s)]
*  military has been depleted and destroyed in many cases. And as far as, you know, taking over, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5850.1s)]
*  they're having a hard time holding on to a little sliver of a non-NATO country that is directly [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5856.02s)]
*  their neighbor right now. What to speak of being able to go and take over Ukraine and move into [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5862.740000000001s)]
*  other countries. So, you know, these arguments that they keep making to justify sending billions [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5868.9800000000005s)]
*  and billions more of our taxpayer dollars to fund this proxy war, there is no justification because [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5874.5s)]
*  it is undermining our economic security and it's undermining our national security and putting us [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5882.82s)]
*  and the world in a place where nuclear war and World War III could be imminent. Not like, oh, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5889.0599999999995s)]
*  a far future possibility. Total destruction of the planet is imminent if this occurs. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5896.82s)]
*  Our leaders are completely failing us because they've got the power and the ability to be able [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5905.54s)]
*  to de-escalate and pull us back from the brink. But they're failing to do so. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5910.34s)]
*  And do you think that they're failing to do so because that would cut off the gravy train? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5915.38s)]
*  That's certainly part of it. That's certainly part of it. This is something, and I'm bringing [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5919.3s)]
*  this up because no one else is talking about it. I ran for president in 2020 warning of this outcome, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5925.9400000000005s)]
*  seeing, hey, this is what's around the corner if you continue to wage these new cold wars. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5933.9400000000005s)]
*  I talked about it virtually every single day, brought it up in virtually every single interview, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5938.74s)]
*  and the media refused to talk about it. It was never brought up in any of the debates. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5944.66s)]
*  And I was even told by a reporter, like, come on, why do you keep talking about nuclear war? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5949.46s)]
*  Here we are. We are unfortunately in this place. And my concern is, you know, look, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5957.94s)]
*  the next presidential election is over, what, two years away, over two years away. We don't [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5962.66s)]
*  know what's going to happen next week or next month with this war. The only way to stop this [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5969.22s)]
*  now is for the American people, people in Europe, people around the world, taking that direct action [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5977.139999999999s)]
*  to make sure that our voice is heard and putting our holding our leaders' feet to the fire, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5984.58s)]
*  to literally bring about an end to this insanity and save our future. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5990.9s)]
*  Did you ever see the video of, I forget who it was from the State Department, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5994.9s)]
*  who was on the Colbert Report. We played it the other day during the Dave Smith podcast. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=5999.139999999999s)]
*  And there was a guy who wrote a book, and this was in 2014, and he was on the Colbert Report, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6005.78s)]
*  back when it was on Comedy Central. And he was essentially bragging about how they are trying to [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6012.18s)]
*  lure the Ukraine. We'll play it for you just so you can watch it. I did not see this. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6021.06s)]
*  Gideon Rose. It's crazy. It's crazy. First of all, before we play it, here's one of the things that's [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6026.02s)]
*  crazy about it is that they're essentially bragging openly about foreign policy shenanigans [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6031.54s)]
*  that are just designed to try to undermine Russia. And they're doing it on Comedy Central [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6042.0199999999995s)]
*  in a joking way while this guy's selling a book. And this guy, we'll play it so you see. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6048.9s)]
*  What does he do again, Jamie? What is his position? Foreign Affairs is a shh. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6055.46s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Magazine is the magazine for the Council on Foreign Relations. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6061.06s)]
*  Okay, so let's listen to him. Fix this mess. Here to tell me how to reanimate Reagan. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6065.06s)]
*  Is the editor of Foreign Affairs Magazine, Gideon Rose. Mr. Rose, thank you so much for being here. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6071.0599999999995s)]
*  There's the magazine, Foreign Affairs. Now, Gideon, help me out here. We've got a battle. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6078.099999999999s)]
*  The Ukraine, some of them want to go into the EU, the European Union, and some of them want to [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6086.179999999999s)]
*  stay with Russia. If the Ukraine's not in Europe right now, what continent is it on? Well, it's part [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6091.94s)]
*  of Eurasia, but it's part of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Bloc. It's basically Robin to [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6097.3s)]
*  Russia's Batman. And the challenge here is to try to attract it to the West, to get it to flip sides. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6102.74s)]
*  So the rebels in the streets, what are they fighting for? They're fighting for a better [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6110.66s)]
*  future. Countries have a development. That sounds like a political speech. No, but it's actually true. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6114.9800000000005s)]
*  Countries have to develop over time. And Ukraine, basically, after the end of the Soviet Union, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6119.3s)]
*  faced two tracks. It could stay a sort of stagnant, corrupt, authoritarian country [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6124.66s)]
*  tied to Russia, or it could essentially join the West. It could modernize, liberalize, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6129.38s)]
*  become a democracy. At the last minute, when it looked like it was going to trade up from its sort [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6134.42s)]
*  of abusive relationship with its boyfriend from the hood to a nice yuppie... You're not loading [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6138.9s)]
*  these choices in any way whatsoever. It's actually true. When it looked like it was going to trade up [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6145.3s)]
*  to a better environment, at the last minute, Putin offered a bribe. How much? 15 billion. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6150.1s)]
*  That's a lot of cash, man. It's a lot of cash. And the president, who himself was tied to the old elites [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6156.42s)]
*  and the eastern part of the country, who ties to Russia, decided to back off the change and go... [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6161.46s)]
*  Do you know how many pirate-themed restaurants you can buy with 15 billion dollars? [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6166.34s)]
*  The problem was the western parts of the country and the younger parts of the country and the more [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6170.5s)]
*  modern, liberal parts of the country basically knew that they had no future being Russia's vassal, [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6174.82s)]
*  and so they took to the streets. Is America taking sides in this in any way? If these people... [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6180.34s)]
*  The rebels are winning right now, right? Yes, just recently. Why isn't Obama spiking the ball [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6185.38s)]
*  in the end zone and calling Putin and saying, hey, you might have won the medal count, but we won the [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6189.94s)]
*  country count, biatch? It's actually a very good question, and the answer is that we don't want [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6194.74s)]
*  Russia to intervene and kick over the table like a game of risk and take Ukraine back. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6201.54s)]
*  Would they do that? Could he send in troops? Yes, he could. So we are choosing... Does Ukraine have [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6206.74s)]
*  any troops of their own? Would they fight back? Yes, but we don't want this to escalate and we [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6210.82s)]
*  don't want Russia to crack down, so we want to basically distract Russia. Oh, look, you have the [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6214.42s)]
*  highest medal count. Oh, you did really well. Is that possible? And focus on the Olympics. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6218.9s)]
*  Here's a shiny object. We'll just take an entire country away from you. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6224.34s)]
*  Okay. Wild. Yeah. That's wild. Yeah. It's just wild that that's like a humorous thing that [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6228.1s)]
*  everybody thought was outside the realm of possibility, and now here we are. Right. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6240.740000000001s)]
*  Right. Eight years later, it's actually happening. It is happening, and you see the drivers of this. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6247.06s)]
*  When we talk about the military-industrial complex, it's not just the United States. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6254.02s)]
*  Because the longer this goes on, the more NATO is strengthened. I think two other countries, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6258.26s)]
*  was it Finland and Sweden, have just joined NATO as a result of this. These big arms deals are also [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6267.620000000001s)]
*  happening with NATO. The major producers of these weapons systems are coming from the military-industrial [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6275.3s)]
*  complex here. There are a lot of interests that are pushing to build and strengthen [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6282.82s)]
*  this whole NATO complex. This war is giving them a great opportunity to do it. There should have been [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6288.099999999999s)]
*  a very direct and full-hearted attempt to de-escalate and try to negotiate an outcome to this [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6299.0599999999995s)]
*  conflict before it started or very quickly after. But instead, what we saw was an influx of money [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6308.660000000001s)]
*  and weapons systems, which helped further escalate this war and no meaningful attempt at all [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6315.700000000001s)]
*  towards an actual diplomatic end to the conflict. There doesn't seem to be any clear path to removing [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6323.3s)]
*  money from influence, especially this kind of money. When you're talking about $1.7 trillion [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6330.5s)]
*  for 2022, that's so much money. It comes down to who we are choosing to elect, really. Congress [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6336.58s)]
*  should pass legislation to prohibit lobbyists and PACs from giving money to members of Congress and [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6344.34s)]
*  candidates. That's what should happen, but it's not what's going to happen so long as these same [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6349.860000000001s)]
*  crooks are in charge. Where does that leave us as voters? It leaves us with making a choice. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6354.42s)]
*  There are candidates from both parties right now who are running, saying, hey, I'm running to serve [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6359.54s)]
*  you in Congress, and I refuse to accept a single penny from a lobbyist or a corporate PAC. There [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6364.82s)]
*  are choices out there. We need more of those choices of people who are not just saying, yeah, [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6371.0599999999995s)]
*  America first, I'll put country first, but then are going in the back door and making these shady [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6376.099999999999s)]
*  deals. People are actually backing up, saying, yes, I'm here to serve you and only you, the American [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6380.42s)]
*  people, and backing it up with their actions. So moving forward, even Trump, one of the things, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6385.78s)]
*  I believe it was with Steve Hilton, he was having this interview, and he started talking about the [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6395.78s)]
*  military industrial complex, about how these people want to go to war. You've never heard a sitting [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6401.86s)]
*  president say something like that. And it was one of the things that I think is kind of interesting [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6408.34s)]
*  about Trump is that he is such a loose cannon that he'll say things like that, which is no one's [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6413.0599999999995s)]
*  going to say that. But how do you stop that influence once a person gets into office? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6418.58s)]
*  Because it seems like, obviously, you never got into that spot, but it seems like once you get [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6425.86s)]
*  into that spot, there's so many moving pieces, and there's so much influence, there's so much money, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6430.9s)]
*  and there's a lot of you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, we're working together on this, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6438.18s)]
*  so that we can work together on that, and we can open up the pathway for this, if you open up that. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6443.0599999999995s)]
*  How does that ever get resolved? By electing a real leader who has a backbone and whose motive [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6448.179999999999s)]
*  is to serve the country and not these interests. You see it with the military industrial complex, [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6455.219999999999s)]
*  you see it with big pharma, you see it with big insurance, you see it with a lot of these different [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6460.259999999999s)]
*  Wall Street. By electing a leader who has the backbone and courage to stand up for the American [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6466.179999999999s)]
*  people, that's how we start to make this change, because then that person who's elected as president, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6475.62s)]
*  commander, and chief, then makes the decision of who's going to be the director of the National [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6480.5s)]
*  Security Council, who's going to be the Secretary of Defense, who's going to be the Secretary of [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6485.78s)]
*  State, who's going to lead all of these federal institutions, including the National Security [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6489.46s)]
*  State, law enforcement, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, making those decisions, and then going [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6495.0599999999995s)]
*  down. So it's not only those who you're pointing to those positions, but recognizing that those [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6501.38s)]
*  bureaucrats who've been there for a really long time and who are very cozy with all of these [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6506.34s)]
*  special interests, actually bringing about that institutional change that we need in order to [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6511.62s)]
*  clean out the system. I'm not saying that this is an easy task at all. It is a tough task, which [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6518.02s)]
*  requires a tough, strong leader to be able to do it. That's why I ran for president, because I've [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6524.42s)]
*  lived through experiencing the cost and consequences of presidents and members of Congress who don't [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6531.3s)]
*  give a shit about the cost of war, not only on our military and our veterans, but on the American [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6537.06s)]
*  people and on the people in the countries where we've gone and waged these regime change wars in [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6545.860000000001s)]
*  the name of spreading democracy and humanitarianism. Meanwhile, we're destroying those countries and [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6552.26s)]
*  harming those people. A leader who can actually fulfill that responsibility of commander in chief [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6557.38s)]
*  is what we need. What insight, if any, do you have on what it must be like to take office? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6564.66s)]
*  The day of office, I don't know if you, do you know Bill Hicks is? Yeah. Stand-up comic, one of [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6574.82s)]
*  the greats. He died in like 90, I won't say like 93 or 94. He had this bit about what it's like the [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6581.22s)]
*  day you take office, that he thinks you're in a smoky room and they show you an angle of the [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6591.14s)]
*  Kennedy assassination that you've never seen before. Then they stop the projector and you just go, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6596.1s)]
*  any questions? Yeah, what's my agenda? What do I need to do? Tell me what to do. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6603.62s)]
*  Because this is what people think, is that once you get into office, then, because so many people [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6608.9s)]
*  had promises and campaign slogans and you go, okay, was Obama just lying? Did he never have [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6614.9s)]
*  intentions to do those things? Or once you get into office, do they appraise you of all the threats to [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6622.26s)]
*  the world? Do they tell you what kind of influence the military industrial complex really has and [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6628.18s)]
*  how impossible it is to get the barbs out of the skin of the American people? [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6634.58s)]
*  Obviously, I have not sat in that chair. But what I will say is if we elect a president [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6641.14s)]
*  who cares more about the title and the reelection and the power than they do about actually doing [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6650.42s)]
*  the job to serve the American people in our country, then yeah, we will end up with a [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6659.06s)]
*  president who is easily bullied and kowtowing to these special interests, whatever they may be, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6667.46s)]
*  told, oh, hey, look, if you make this decision that we don't like, whether it be the military [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6676.18s)]
*  industrial complex or big pharma, we're going to pull our support from you, or we're going to do [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6682.1s)]
*  this or we're going to do that, if that's not a leader, that's a follower. What do you think [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6687.38s)]
*  happens to you if you go against the grain? I've experienced it to a degree. But imagine a person [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6694.82s)]
*  like, are you going to run as president, as an independent? The system as it sits today, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6702.74s)]
*  that's not a viable option. Are you going to run for option? It's not a viable option because [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6710.9800000000005s)]
*  because I think it was back when Ross Perot ran for president as I think he was an independent, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6715.219999999999s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken, and he was beating Bill Clinton in the polls. Both parties saw that [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6722.58s)]
*  as a direct threat to themselves and got together and rigged the system to practically speaking, [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6730.58s)]
*  shut out a third option. Well, they shut him out, the commission for presidential debates, which is [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6737.94s)]
*  a privately funded institution, which most people don't know, which is kind of crazy. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6743.06s)]
*  They changed the standards for the debates. They did. And then also they changed the electoral [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6750.26s)]
*  college to make it so that if you have a viable third option, basically none of the parties will [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6757.38s)]
*  get the minimum number of electoral votes through this winner take all system needed to actually [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6765.780000000001s)]
*  win. And then it goes to Congress and then Congress will make that selection. And so the [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6772.26s)]
*  electoral college system itself also needs to be reformed to one that is proportional. So if I were [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6777.3s)]
*  to run for president and win 60% of Texas, I would get 60% of Texas's electoral votes rather than [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6784.34s)]
*  if you win a state, you get all of them. Right. That makes sense. When you say they [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6791.62s)]
*  changed the presidential elections and they changed the electoral college, like who's they? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6797.86s)]
*  The leadership of both parties. So they decided that if we are threatened by a legitimate third [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6803.0599999999995s)]
*  party, this is how we can stop that in its tracks. And so now a third party is essentially almost [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6810.339999999999s)]
*  impossible. As of today, yes. It would be great to live in a world where that were not the case, but [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6816.58s)]
*  when you look at the practical application of our electoral system right now, it's not a viable path. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6824.74s)]
*  Are you going to run for any kind of office as an independent? [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6832.34s)]
*  I'm not running for anything now. I am deeply, deeply concerned about this [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6837.0599999999995s)]
*  very real and imminent threat of nuclear war that no one is talking about, that no one is preparing [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6847.38s)]
*  the American people for, that people are kind of sitting ducks because of the decisions that our [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6853.46s)]
*  leaders have made. If I felt that there was a way that I could stop that and make a difference and [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6859.9400000000005s)]
*  impact that and pull us back from the brink, then yeah, I'd seriously consider running again. My [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6870.5s)]
*  concern though is like, we don't know what's going to happen and we don't know if it's going to be too late. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6878.98s)]
*  There's no way to argue with that. As you're saying this, I'm like, yeah, yeah. I mean, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6893.62s)]
*  I wish I had a counterpoint. Is it possible that this is it? But this does not look good. And [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6900.66s)]
*  I don't know how many people are even really truly aware of how close we are. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6908.02s)]
*  Most people aren't. Most people aren't. And part of it is because, again, the media hardly covers it. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6912.34s)]
*  And if they do, they're talking about it as though it's like one missile system against the other. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6919.06s)]
*  They're talking about the waging of a nuclear war as though it can be won or as though there's some [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6927.94s)]
*  kind of limitation to the destruction and devastation that it will cause. Going back to [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6934.42s)]
*  Reagan, he talked about how a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6943.22s)]
*  You go back to JFK recognized the serious danger and risk of a nuclear war. We go back to these [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6949.22s)]
*  leaders in the past from both parties who saw how dangerous a nuclear war would be and therefore [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6955.14s)]
*  took action to try to reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons in the world and try to put these [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6962.26s)]
*  nonproliferation treaties in place. Almost all of those treaties have been stripped away at this [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6967.22s)]
*  point. There is one left between the United States and Russia, the two largest nuclear powers in the [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6972.66s)]
*  world. And that is being eroded as we speak the longer this war continues. So no, I think the [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6978.820000000001s)]
*  American people don't largely know. And that's why it's so important to talk about it, because [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6985.46s)]
*  as we sit here today, that's the only thing that'll make a difference at this point, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=6992.66s)]
*  is people here in the United States, people in Europe, people around the world [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7001.62s)]
*  stepping up, speaking out, making sure that our voices are heard, taking action to say, no, [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7005.780000000001s)]
*  absolutely not. Our leaders need to look out for our lives, our futures, our country, this planet. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7011.7s)]
*  And negotiate an end to this war and prevent destruction of this planet. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7020.9800000000005s)]
*  There's also these very simplistic narratives that are going out now. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7027.54s)]
*  Like, you have to support Ukraine, put a Ukraine flag in your Twitter bio. And I see so many people [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7032.660000000001s)]
*  doing that. And then Russia invaded Ukraine. So supporting Ukraine is important. So we should [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7039.22s)]
*  send money to Ukraine. And that's it. And don't ask questions. Don't ask how that money is being [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7046.18s)]
*  spent. Don't question the corruption that everybody knows exists in Ukraine. Don't question where those [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7052.66s)]
*  weapons are going. Don't question what the actual real life ramifications are to our national [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7059.54s)]
*  security as a country, to our future, given a nuclear war is on the line. What to speak of [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7068.34s)]
*  the direct economic implications we are already feeling with gas prices hiking in many places in [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7075.22s)]
*  the country, increased inflation, supply shortages, food shortages. The UN's food guy, I can't remember [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7081.62s)]
*  his official title, but he's already sounded a warning saying that this war is causing an [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7095.06s)]
*  unprecedented threat of global starvation, global starvation. So the ramifications of this, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7101.46s)]
*  people are just like, ah, okay, go to war and here's more guns and here's more weapons. And [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7108.66s)]
*  instead of actually being leaders and advocating for peace and a negotiated resolution where, yes, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7113.62s)]
*  Ukraine's going to have to give up something. Russia's going to have to give up something. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7120.26s)]
*  That's literally what happens when you negotiate an end to a war. You can look throughout history, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7123.78s)]
*  nobody walks away completely happy, but that's what needs to happen for the sake of humanity [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7129.54s)]
*  at this point. And our leaders are failing to do so. And so we're at a point where the future is in [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7135.22s)]
*  our hands and what are we willing to do? I'm going to ask you a difficult question. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7141.86s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen? If we continue down this path that we have seen, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7146.9s)]
*  where we have seen this war continue to escalate since the invasion happened, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7155.54s)]
*  we will end up in World War III and a nuclear holocaust. If nothing else changes and we continue [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7164.1s)]
*  down this path, this is where that path leads. And it's not some far-flung possibility. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7176.02s)]
*  They're talking about this now. It's very difficult for people to live in a world without nuclear war, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7187.700000000001s)]
*  to live in a world where you get up, your alarm clock goes off, you go to work, you drive the same [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7194.26s)]
*  way every day, to imagine the eradication of all civility, of all the things, all of our structure [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7198.9s)]
*  in terms of all of our, just everything from all of our civil liberties to all of our roads [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7209.139999999999s)]
*  and utilities being gone, everything eradicated almost instantaneously. And living in a lawless [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7220.179999999999s)]
*  structureless society where people are scrambling for food and dying of radiation poisoning, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7229.299999999999s)]
*  if you're lucky, because those are the lucky ones who survive. Exactly. And how long that [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7235.46s)]
*  radiation contamination lasts. Hundreds of thousands of years. It's an impossible [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7243.54s)]
*  scenario for people to put it in. The radiation will last as long as homo sapiens have existed. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7249.54s)]
*  Which is wild. And so we're in a position where I'm sure the billionaires of the world have their [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7259.219999999999s)]
*  deep bunkers with food sources and water sources. Do they even though? Do they even? I gotta believe [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7268.58s)]
*  that they do. Have you ever heard of one? I know that, I mean look, I know there are contingencies [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7273.54s)]
*  in place for our politicians at the highest levels, should this situation occur, so that they can [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7280.9s)]
*  continue to manage and wage the war from another location. What do you make of the pipeline blowing [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7289.299999999999s)]
*  up? Because now people are saying that the pipeline, whoever did it, they did it intentionally. And [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7297.299999999999s)]
*  what do you think that's all about? War is unpredictable. And so [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7306.26s)]
*  that this occurred should not have been a surprise. I don't know who did it. I haven't [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7315.3s)]
*  seen any evidence to point in one direction or another. Russia's got the financial investment [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7321.06s)]
*  in that pipeline. So I don't know, somebody's done the numbers. I don't remember what they are, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7330.1s)]
*  but how much money they lost in that, with that explosion and that pipeline being sabotaged. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7335.06s)]
*  So I don't know who is responsible, but we should not be surprised that as this war escalates, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7343.38s)]
*  that this sort of thing happens. And it should cause everyone to wonder, okay, so this week it [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7349.22s)]
*  was a pipeline, a major energy pipeline being sabotaged, cutting off the ability for major [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7355.860000000001s)]
*  countries in Europe as they head into winter from having that option. Internet cables, deep [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7364.82s)]
*  undersea internet cables, GPS satellites, other necessary pieces of infrastructure, not only to [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7372.98s)]
*  the United States, but to the world. What's next in this escalation of war? And again, this is not [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7381.38s)]
*  just about something happening in Europe, because again, we've already seen in this past week, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7389.139999999999s)]
*  at least on the West Coast and other parts of the country, how gas prices have gone up, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7395.219999999999s)]
*  50 cents, 70 cents, they're continuing to rise. All of these things are directly connected. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7399.139999999999s)]
*  And you mentioned the loss of civil liberties. Let's say we get to a point where World War III [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7406.179999999999s)]
*  is sparked because of this, but a nuclear weapon has not been used. It's absolutely a realistic [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7412.099999999999s)]
*  outcome to imagine some kind of martial law being implemented here in the United States, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7421.3s)]
*  because now we are a country at war, and there are certain regulations and civil liberties that [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7427.0599999999995s)]
*  are being violated, just like we've seen with the Patriot Act in the past. We've seen recent [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7431.94s)]
*  examples of the country being shut down by the government in the public interest. And so these [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7438.66s)]
*  outcomes are not just theoretical. This is where we are headed if we don't change course. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7446.58s)]
*  Adam Felsenfeld Yeah, I'm concerned about all that. And I'm concerned about the lack of [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7454.9s)]
*  understanding that people have about the implementation of things like a digital [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7460.26s)]
*  currency that is centralized, that's controlled by the government. That scares the shit out of me. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7465.94s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7470.98s)]
*  Adam Felsenfeld Because that's what we're... And Maxine Waters, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7471.299999999999s)]
*  who has been promoting this, said that we need this to compete with China, which is so crazy. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7474.099999999999s)]
*  It's like saying we need communism to compete with communisms. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7479.62s)]
*  Maxine Waters Exactly. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7482.66s)]

*  Maxine Waters Yeah. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7484.5s)]
*  Adam Felsenfeld If you want to compete with communists, you have to be a communist. Like what? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7484.98s)]
*  Digital currency that's centralized by the state is terrifying because they'll connect it to a [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7489.78s)]
*  social credit score system. If they connect it to a social credit score system, Tulsi Gabbard, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7493.94s)]
*  I don't like what you said on the Joe Rogan experience, we're going to go and eliminate [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7498.9s)]
*  your ability to fly. You can't fly, you can't travel, you can't buy gas anymore, which is [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7502.179999999999s)]
*  what they do in China. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7508.58s)]
*  Maxine Waters It's all within the realm of possibility. And you look at that and what [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7509.54s)]
*  is the recent thing of... I think Elizabeth Warren was pushing for credit card companies to start [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7513.219999999999s)]
*  tracking people who buy ammunition and firearms and report that to the government. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7518.42s)]
*  Adam Felsenfeld Well, Visa has done this. Visa is going to change the way they categorize [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7523.62s)]
*  gun sales. So they'll put gun sales in a different realm of regular sales, which is to let people know, [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7526.98s)]
*  like, hey, we're watching you. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7535.54s)]
*  Maxine Waters Yeah, exactly. And not just because like, oh, well, I'm just curious. No. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7536.58s)]
*  Adam Felsenfeld No. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7540.66s)]
*  Maxine Waters There's a regulatory follow-up action to that violation of privacy. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7541.0599999999995s)]
*  Adam Felsenfeld Do you have any good news? Is there anything happy you talk about, Tulsi? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7546.5s)]
*  When you and I talk outside of this, it's always very happy. You're a happy person. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7552.099999999999s)]
*  Maxine Waters I am a happy person. I'm full of aloha, Joe. That's why I'm warning people [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7556.26s)]
*  about the impending doom of us, of where our leaders are taking us. And really it is that [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7562.34s)]
*  it's that care for each other and for our planet and our future that should encourage us to be [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7570.900000000001s)]
*  involved and to be engaged. And as disheartening as our election systems and politics can be, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7578.18s)]
*  we've got to know that we have to be the change. No one else is going to come and save us. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7586.58s)]
*  Our founders envisioned this country as a country of, by, and for the people. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7593.3s)]
*  Many in our government have forgotten that, unfortunately. They're not going to wake up [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7599.860000000001s)]
*  one day and magically remember. It's up to us to bring about that change and the system that our [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7604.82s)]
*  founders set up for us. It has its flaws. We've got a lot of work to do on it with the money, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7612.66s)]
*  lobbyists and PAC money, corrupting our politics, election integrity, making sure that [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7619.54s)]
*  people are actually trusting the system and that their votes will be counted as they were cast. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7627.139999999999s)]
*  There's work to do, but these changes can only come about when we are all informed and engaged [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7632.66s)]
*  in the process. So one piece of news, last time I came on your show, I talked about launching a podcast. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7641.54s)]
*  I'm finally doing it. Specifically to be able to really, I'll go and do different interviews. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7648.98s)]
*  They're like four to five minutes long. I have like, okay, cool. I can say four sentences in [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7656.66s)]
*  that period of time, but to actually take a deep dive into examining like, hey, here are the [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7660.82s)]
*  challenges that we're facing. Here's how we identify what the problem is and the cause. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7667.299999999999s)]
*  And here are some of the things that we need to be able to do to solve these problems. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7671.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's the reality of conversations. And I think it took until podcasts existed [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7677.299999999999s)]
*  where people realized the value of talking about one particular subject for over an hour. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7685.86s)]
*  When we were talking about gender identity and the craziness of woke culture, that's [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7692.74s)]
*  uninterrupted. It keeps going on and on. You could never do that on a network television show. You'd [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7697.54s)]
*  get interrupted by a commercial. We'll be right back and the audience claps. This is madness. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7702.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7707.86s)]
*  You can't have a nuanced, important conversation about a subject that is very complex. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7708.339999999999s)]
*  Quickly. You can't do it quickly. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7715.78s)]
*  And really when you think about it, all of these different things, you might see a headline here, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7717.38s)]
*  a sound bite there. There's always so much more to it. And looking at different people's views [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7721.86s)]
*  and actually encouraging those conversations and helping people just to understand each other, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7729.22s)]
*  right, as people. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7737.62s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the good news is people recognize that. And that's one of the reasons why podcasts are so [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7738.5s)]
*  huge. The numbers that we get off of this conversation will be so much bigger than any [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7744.5s)]
*  other conversation that you can have anywhere else, which is weird. But that's why. It's because [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7751.22s)]
*  people recognize, like, hey, it's not satisfying to watch these five minute chunks on CNN where [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7757.46s)]
*  people talking over each other with three different screens, three different boxes on the screen, [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7763.22s)]
*  and everybody's yelling over each other, all right, well, thank you for your input. Bye. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7767.94s)]
*  Click. We solved nothing. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7771.62s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7772.82s)]
*  You don't learn anything. No insight gained. See you. Bye bye. And here's Pfizer brought to you [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7773.7s)]
*  by Pfizer. It's like this is wild. Like this is a dystopian Mike Judge movie. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7779.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not an accident that you never hear people on those channels saying, hey, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7784.5s)]
*  you should be careful about what Pfizer is telling you because of the drugs or the vaccines or [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7790.26s)]
*  whatever it is they're trying to sell you and then cut to the Pfizer commercial. It's not an [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7795.22s)]
*  accident that, you know, seventy five percent of all television advertisement is pharmaceutical [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7799.46s)]
*  companies, which is insane. It is absolutely. And we are one of two countries on Earth that allows [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7804.66s)]
*  that. The other one is New Zealand and New Zealand is much more strict than us. Yeah. And I mean, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7809.94s)]
*  this is a huge other topic. I know you've talked about a lot before, too, is like people talk about [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7815.62s)]
*  health care reform in America, but most people who talk about it aren't identifying the root cause of [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7820.9800000000005s)]
*  the problem, which is our entire system incentivizes sickness and obesity and people being [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7828.34s)]
*  unhealthy. Our system is built around that. It does not incentivize health and wellness and [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7835.78s)]
*  nutrition and prevention and fitness. And again, I mean, this who's making the money here? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7841.7s)]
*  Yeah, prevention is the big word. And, you know, it's the problem is these corporations are always [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7849.14s)]
*  trying to make more money every year. And if they go around telling you, hey, you know, we'd make [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7855.3s)]
*  less money, but you'd be happier if you stop eating sugar and garbage and start exercising [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7859.860000000001s)]
*  every day. Right. Right. Yeah. There's no incentive. It blew my mind during the covid pandemic era [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7864.74s)]
*  that Jen Psaki at the White House refused. She refused to say that, hey, nutrition and being [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7871.7s)]
*  healthy could actually help you if you get covid, that the symptoms might not be so bad. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7881.54s)]
*  Did she refuse? Like she was encouraged? Somebody was asked. Somebody somebody asked her a direct [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7887.7s)]
*  question, you know, and I think this was centered around I think the CDC was saying that people who [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7892.18s)]
*  are obese are more likely to have severe consequences, health consequences if they if they catch covid. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7899.14s)]
*  And so the reporter asked the question, I don't know, I don't remember which outlet it came from, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7906.5s)]
*  but the reporter said, so are you the White House therefore then advocating for nutrition and health [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7909.86s)]
*  in order to try to prevent that? And she just said, we take all of our guidance from the CDC [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7917.78s)]
*  and the CDC says get vaccinated. She couldn't even just say, well, yeah, of course, try to be healthy. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7925.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Well, she's a propagandist. I mean, that's that job. You're the propaganda arm. Yeah. And [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7930.58s)]
*  but it's stuff like that, right? It's stuff like that that people see them be like, what's wrong [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7936.98s)]
*  with you? Like, are you a robot? Right. Why can't you say the thing that's obvious to everyone? [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7940.82s)]
*  Well, if they really care, they would tell people supplement with vitamin D. Yeah. They've been one [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7946.0199999999995s)]
*  of the first things to say. It's cheap. It's not hard to do. Yeah. We have plenty of it. Let's go. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7950.339999999999s)]
*  And and we know statistically that people are radically deficient in this country. Yeah. And [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7955.139999999999s)]
*  lose weight. It's not hard to lose weight. In fact, it's cheap. Yeah. You eat less food. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7960.98s)]
*  Right. Costs less money. And eat healthier food. Eat real food. Yeah. I mean, the percentage of [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7964.9s)]
*  people in this country that eat fast food primarily on a daily basis is crazy and that we've done [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7971.299999999999s)]
*  nothing to especially for lower income people to make real healthy food available to them easily [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7977.46s)]
*  and readily. And this this goes back to that information where these norms have been created. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7982.98s)]
*  I've had conversations with different people recently. Somebody who was telling me about [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7988.74s)]
*  his experience, like they were overseas and deployed and it was somebody's birthday and like [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7995.219999999999s)]
*  one of the guys knew how to cook and he made this amazing orange cake. Like he actually went to the [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=7999.94s)]
*  market and got oranges and made this cake from scratch, like not even from a box. And it was [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8006.26s)]
*  better than a cake from Walmart. And I'm like, holy crap. Like, why is it abnormal to make a [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8011.38s)]
*  cake from scratch where you put the flour and you put the sugar and you put the oil or whatever. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8017.94s)]
*  It doesn't come from a box. That's why we're so crazy that things with preservatives that come [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8024.98s)]
*  from the store are normal. Yeah. And things that you just make out of actual food are not even [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8030.58s)]
*  when it comes to like something like cake, which is not even good for you anyway. Exactly. Same [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8036.259999999999s)]
*  thing as this other woman I was talking to and she's like gluten intolerant, newly gluten [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8040.5s)]
*  intolerant or like diagnosed with celiac. She's like, I'm really having a hard time and you know, [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8046.42s)]
*  there are certain foods I can't eat and I'm trying to cook for my family and this and that. I was like, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8050.66s)]
*  oh, I got a great gravy recipe because she was like, I can't eat gravy. I was like, no, you can [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8054.34s)]
*  make gravy, but use garbanzo flour instead of regular flour and use this and you add this and [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8059.22s)]
*  you add that. And she's like, you make gravy from scratch? Oh my God. It's like, oh, my heart hurts. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8064.9800000000005s)]
*  It's crazy, right? Yeah. It's a sad, it's kind of a sad picture of where we are. Well, that's [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8072.660000000001s)]
*  just how it's going to change if everything goes south, you're going to have to learn how to figure [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8078.740000000001s)]
*  out how to get food. Yeah. And it's not good. No. It's, I mean, there's so many apocalyptic [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8083.46s)]
*  movies and television shows out now too. It's like, they're just like, I mean, it's in the back of our [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8089.620000000001s)]
*  head that this could all go away at any moment. You know, the dystopian landscape, the destroyed [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w01QRhD3e0&t=8095.54s)]
