# Joe Rogan Experience #1524 - Ron Funches
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 13, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjLW5irADoM)
*  Hello Ron. Hello Joe. How are you? I'm good man. You got double water bottles. One water,
*  one protein shake. Oh? You're not fucking around. No, I knew it. You know, last time
*  I wasn't aware how long I would be here. Now I'm prepared, I'm gonna settle in, I'm not
*  gonna be hungry. My wife got me all set up. Nice. Water, protein shake. Make sure that
*  your blood sugar doesn't drop. Mhmm. Maintain energy levels. Mhmm. You are a man who has
*  done one of the most difficult things a person could do. You lost a ton of weight. Yeah,
*  and then maintain keeping it up. Yes. That's the harder. Right, that's the hard part. Yeah.
*  Yeah, the momentum of losing the weight is good, but most people they get to a point
*  and they want to take a break. Mhmm. And then once they take a break then it all slides.
*  Yeah, it's a bit of both. Sometimes I want to take a break, but then I want to get to
*  that next level. So then I get back on it. Next level. Well we were talking about Gucci
*  Mane before we started the podcast. Gucci is the guy who's done that. Yes. He's maintained
*  and looks fucking amazing. He was a big fella. Yeah. At one point in time when he had Burr
*  tattooed on his face. Mhmm. Ice cream cone. Yeah. And now he's shredded. Yeah. He got
*  rid of that ice cream. Well you were saying it was the lean right? Yeah, for sure. Yeah,
*  codeine will put a lot of weight on him. Look at the difference man. That is crazy. Well
*  he wasn't too fat in the other one. Yeah, that's like, yeah that's kinda like him mid
*  losing weight in that one. You can find some real chunky pics of him. Yeah, he got thick.
*  Yeah. And now shredded. Yeah. Shredded with him. Yeah, me and my wife all the time. We
*  look at him and his wife, the pictures they take, what they do, and I'm like, I want to
*  head in that direction. What do you do for workin' out? I have my trainer about three
*  days a week, sometimes two days a week, and then on top of that, and we'll do just different
*  circuits, back, chest, you know, whatever, whatever, legs, and then the other days I'm
*  always just trying to make sure I hit the treadmill twice a day for two miles on any
*  climb. Twice a day? Yeah, yeah. Really? You do it twice a day? Yeah, in the morning and
*  night. I don't do much otherwise, so you know, especially now a lot of my stuff is sitting
*  in front of a computer, podcasting, playing games on Twitch and stuff like that, so I
*  feel like, oh, if I'm gonna sit that long, I gotta start the day, treadmill, end the
*  day. That's discipline. I like that. It is. I fucking hate it, so it definitely is discipline.
*  But you like the results. Yeah, I like how I feel. I like the compliments, you know,
*  I was just doing this thing the other day, and Jake Johnson, the guy from New Girl, I'm
*  in a cartoon with him, and that's like, you know, he's like a leading man, dream boat-y
*  guy, and he's looking at me, he's like, man, he's like, you're looking fucking good, man,
*  you got your shit together, you're about to lead your own show, and I hear shit like that,
*  and I'm like, okay, I better go get on that treadmill again. Yeah, that helps, right?
*  It really does. Yeah, the positive feedback and positive energy, that's one thing that
*  I like about what you do. You are very positive, like you're very warm and friendly, like all
*  the shit that you do online, you're all smiley and positive and friendly, it's cool, it gives
*  off a good vibe, like when I look at your Instagram posts or read something that you
*  post, it's like, Ron is on the good path. Yeah, I try to, you know, because it's just,
*  it's so easy to go the other way, and you caught up in what other people are doing and
*  what you think you should be doing, which I battle all of that too, so I don't ever
*  try to act like, oh, I'm just like, oh, everything's great, it's like, of course, I go through
*  shit all the time, but like, I think I choose to support my friends, I choose to support
*  because that's what I can control, and that's to me, fighting against that negative as opposed
*  to like, just joining everybody in the fray. Yeah, what do you mean by like, how do you
*  feel like when you say like, you feel that too, like the field, you feel the draw to
*  the negative? Oh, I mean, because we all like, you know, we just want things, you know, so
*  I wanted a Netflix special, I want to be a lead in a show, I want my own show, you know,
*  and I've already do a lot of great things, but and that's why I have to balance it out
*  because I'm like, oh, man, I'm in such a great position, I do so many wonderful things, I
*  would always helps me actually is talking to people like you are talking to people like
*  Bert talking to any comedian that's been doing it, like 20 years plus when I'm at like 14
*  now, and when I talked to them, and then they are like, oh, hold on, slow the fuck down,
*  man, like, you look at where you are and what you're doing for how long you've been doing
*  your fucking aces, man, so chill the fuck out and play it out. Don't freak out. And
*  that that always, you know, having faith that always helps me out.
*  Well, we're all stalled right now. Yeah, unfortunately, because we can't work. But stand up is a long
*  haul. Like you're at 10 years, people start taking you seriously. You know, if you're
*  really precocious, people start looking at you at seven, like, damn, this motherfucker
*  is good. But at 10 years, they go, okay, that guy's a pro, or she's really got it. She's
*  legit. 10 years usually. So for 14, man, you're cooking, you know, 14, you got things
*  happening, you know, you're putting together like real sets, you got like you get off stage,
*  you're like, damn, that's that was legit. That was legit. Fucking it's a long road to
*  get good at stand up. You know, it's like that AC DC song. It's a long way to the top.
*  If you want to rock and roll. I was on stage or not about to go on stage rather, at the
*  improv once and there was this lady who was on stage and she you could tell she's real recent
*  and she was just eating it just eating shit up there. And me and the DJ were just like,
*  I just looked at him. I go, it's a long way to the top. If you want to rock and roll.
*  And then the DJ played that song as I went on stage. It's a long way to the top. It is man.
*  It's a fucking long way. Yeah, no, and I agree. And that's what I had to change my mindset very
*  early because, you know, I came from not having money, not having anything and having my son
*  really early. And so I was like, I need to make it. And then like, I remember I got on Conan the
*  first time and and I they were like, oh, what do you promote? And you got to promote something,
*  you know, when we introduce you. And the only thing I had to promote was an open mic that I
*  was doing in Portland the next day. This is always going to be a part of this. This is always going
*  to be here. It's always going to be there will be highs and then there'll be another day. And so I
*  got to learn to not, you know, fear that next day and just be like, this is mean this is just my life
*  and that's what's helped me through all of this quarantine stuff. So I'm back doing weird Zoom
*  shows. I'm doing my own live stream show September 5th and people adapt. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly.
*  The best at it so far I've seen is Andrew Schultz. Andrew Schultz has adapted the best because he's
*  really figured out a whole new kind of a format. He's figured out how to do these like 10 minute
*  chunks on a particular subject, like rapid fire with images behind him and his style of comedy.
*  And it's I've been calling a quarantine comedy because it's like there's no one in the room but
*  him. It's just, you know, and it's high production value. And it's it's without network notes. It's
*  without and it's him being able to distill his voice without anybody telling him what to do.
*  So then when you watch it compared to things you're seeing on TV, which now because they're
*  forced to scale back start looking very similar. You're like, why the fuck would I watch this?
*  Yeah, he's so much more fun. Yeah. Yeah. Schultz is so much funnier than those guys. Those guys are
*  forced to do TV kind of comedy for the internet. And that shit is not good enough. TV kind of
*  comedy is OK if you have TV kind of restrictions, you know, those restrictions that they have for
*  language and content, then you can get away with it. But if you just, you know, if you're forced to
*  compete in that internet realm, like the internet is wild, man. The Wild West. It's a full on Wild
*  West. You know, this show, like you could never do this fucking show. No one will ever allow me to
*  do this show anywhere else. The only way it would have ever worked is to have no one telling you
*  what to do. The thing about those feelings that you get when you see other people doing stuff and
*  good things happen to them, you're like, I want that. I want that. That's fuel, man. That's the
*  keys. Like how you harness that fuel. You can pour it all over yourself and light yourself on fire,
*  which a lot of people do. Like, you know, yeah, we see it all the time, all the time. Or you can
*  just go, I'm going to work harder. I'm going to fucking just buckle down. I'm going to stay
*  focused and I'm going to somehow or another be my best self, be the best version. Yeah. I never
*  deny jealousy. You know, to me, that's like, that's just lying to people when you say like, oh no,
*  I don't get jealous. Like I would, when I was a very young comic, I would listen, read Patton
*  Oswalt's The Spew. And I think he wrote something, he wrote jealousy is a map of where you want to
*  be. And I was like, oh, if I just look at it like that, that's a lot easier for me to swallow.
*  That's a wise way of looking at it. Yeah. You also, one thing that for me, when I first started
*  doing standup, I was real jealous. And I also, I also didn't like comedy anymore. I didn't like
*  other people's comedy because I would be jealous. Like I would watch someone kill and I go, oh, why
*  didn't I come up with that joke? Oh my God, he's so much better than me. Oh my God, he's killing.
*  Shit. I want to be like that. And then I realized like, oh my God, I've stopped enjoying comedy.
*  And now I'm not a fan anymore. And one of the things that switched with me is I realized that
*  I was, I had a very weak perspective on it. Instead of being inspired and instead of being
*  like energized, I was like wishing that they would do badly, which is a real common thing.
*  Like you, you see someone who's doing much better than you and you actually hope they fail. Yeah.
*  Well, you see a lot of people, once you see them start succeeding a bit, I've noticed in general,
*  you stop seeing people champion them. You know, they stop, they're like, oh, well you've made it
*  as far as I wanted you to. And they call you a sellout. Yeah. Oh my God, you sell out.
*  But I love being inspired. That I've never had. Like I've always been inspired by comedy. I've
*  always loved comedy. And I, I sure there's comedy I love more than others, but I've always learned
*  to go like, well, that's not for me. You know, I respect their craft. I respect the way they put
*  that together, but that was not for me. But I always looked at it like rap, where it's like,
*  man, you look at like the old death row records or then they always were sharpening each other
*  by how good each individual was. And I looked at comedy the same way where it's like, oh, if I see
*  an amazing set, I'm not like trying to steal that joke or trying to that, but I'm going like, oh,
*  fuck, I gotta raise my game. Yeah. Well, that was one of the best things that we had at the store.
*  Absolutely. We were all working together and you know, we'd have a show on it. It'd be you and me
*  and Burr and you know, and Eliza and Whitney and fucking Ali Wong and bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
*  These shows were fire. It was just, and you had a warm up in the back. I'd be in the back. I'd be
*  jumping up and down on cushions and shit and shadow boxing and touching my toes and taking deep breaths.
*  And you got to, you know, you got to get your body charged up. You know, I missed that. I missed that
*  a lot. I missed that a lot. I missed that feeling of being the main room, green room, get ready to
*  go on. Woo. And just the hang man. Yeah. I missed the hang. Oh, truly. I mean, for me especially,
*  because I was still always looking at it as like, oh, I'm the young guy on the totem pole here. And
*  it's cool that, you know, there's one thing, the original room is awesome, but when you're on these
*  main room shows, you know, like, oh, they're putting me on here because they also think I'm
*  a part of a draw. And so be on that with you guys, but being younger in the game than you guys and
*  being like, oh fuck, I have to follow Ali, Joe, Joey Diaz, you know, Whitney. I have to follow them
*  all. And then I don't have the credits that these people are going to care about. It was the thing
*  I've learned to crave. I mean, like, because when I got them, I was like, they are on my side because
*  I'm fucking good. They don't know anything else. They don't know what I've done. They have now
*  figured out I'm good. And that I miss so much. I was there once and I brought you up and you said
*  something along the lines of Joe reminds me of that teacher that got arrested for having sex with a
*  he said, with a senior or something. He's like that cool teacher. Yeah. That you find out. He
*  tells you all the cool stuff. He tells you how the real world works. And then you find out he was
*  having a relationship with the teacher's aide. I was crying. I was crying. But it's like those
*  kinds of moments, man. It's like the camaraderie of the store. One of the best things about the
*  quarantine is being able to do this podcast and have guys like you on and have all of our friends
*  come here and just sit down and just at least spend time together and have some fun and talk.
*  Because I miss that so much, man. Look, I love my regular friends and I love my family. I love
*  my neighbors. But they're not comics. They're not, man. It's fucking different. My wife is funny as
*  shit. She's funny. She says mean shit to me. To be funny, like funny shit. Makes fun of me. It's fun.
*  It's like we have a good time. But comics are a different animal, man. And if you're not around
*  them for a while, you go fuck. I wish I could just have someone who just wants to fuck around
*  and talk shit. Just have some fun. Yeah. Someone who's not getting their fill and hurt. God,
*  everyone's so goddamn sensitive. Make fun of me, please. Please. Let's talk some shit.
*  Yeah. No. That is what I miss the most is just being in the back, seeing my friends. And those
*  are things we took for granted so much as well because I'd just be like, all right, well, I'll
*  see you tomorrow. And now I don't see nobody ever. When we were shutting down in March
*  and I was thinking like, you know what, man, I'm just going to buckle down, work out a lot,
*  write, you know, come June or whatever the fuck this is over. I'll come back guns blazing.
*  And then when I realized that there was going to be a second lockdown and then there was going to
*  be no return and here we are in August and there's no site, it's not going to happen. It's not going
*  to happen until 2021. There's no way. I was like, fuck, like this is terrible. This is a terrible
*  feeling. I could never would have imagined that I would have to worry about comedy clubs going
*  under, but they're going under all over the place, man. They just can't stay open. It's crazy.
*  Yeah. No, I mean, I was in the exact same boat. I mean, I think most of us were, we were just like,
*  okay, well, I can last. I'll put it together. Just treat it like I'm in a short-term prison sentence
*  and just work out and get my GED and just get it all together. Become a lawyer. Yeah. Go over my case.
*  Yeah. And then, yeah, same thing. That second lockdown happened and something happened in my
*  brain where I was like, okay, I'm going to have to just, because before I was like, oh, no Zoom
*  shows, nothing like that. I don't like how it's fucking with my rhythm. I don't like how I'm not
*  getting feedback. But after that, I was like, you know, I just kind of have to adapt and go with the
*  flow and hope things change and know that things change in time no matter what. But if this is how
*  it is, I got to stop fighting it and start just like, you know, finding my lane in it. So, you know,
*  I'm just trying to do that now. Yeah. You have a podcast, luckily. I felt bad for dudes who didn't.
*  Yes. For the folks, the guys and the gals that didn't have podcasts. I was like, ooh,
*  like you got no way to keep in touch with people. Yeah. I mean, and that was exactly the reason why
*  I started my podcast because I was like, oh, I'm like, everything I'm doing is a guest in other
*  people's shit. Like I'm a guest in everyone else's home. And I don't have a home for people to come
*  and hang out with me. And so I've been thinking that for a long time. And that's the reason why
*  I started my podcast. And when all this stuff happened, I was like, I was very happy. Because
*  I've always been in two minds when it comes to comedy. I love specialists. I love people who are
*  just like, I do stand up, straight stand up. I'm going to be the best fucking stand up in the world.
*  I love being that competitive. But I also have this part of me that's just like, I love new
*  challenges of all types. And so I got into voice acting, regular acting, all that stuff. And when
*  this thing came down, I was like, oh fuck, actually, just like in business, it is good to diversify
*  because voice acting is saving my fucking life right now. Yeah. Yeah. As a person in show business,
*  you must have as many forms of revenue as you can. And you have to save for a rainy day. You have to
*  do those two things. And I've been real lucky that I have weird taste. I'm into weird shit. So I have
*  cage fighting commentary. And then I also have the podcast. And I also have this stand up thing,
*  which is just on hold indefinitely. You could do it right now. I mean, have you thought about doing
*  one of those drive in movie shows? I talked to a bird about it. He made it sound interesting.
*  Yeah, he loves it. The way he sells it made it sound fun. But you got to realize he's drunk,
*  though. Yeah, I do. And I realize that. I do realize that. He's like horns. Yeah. He likes
*  horns and people hot beaming him. Like, explain. He's like, dude, it's like a UFO. I'm actually,
*  I've been talking with Chris Titus because he has his own little production studio. I shouldn't call
*  it little because he has his own production. I don't have no fucking production studio. He has
*  his own big ass production studio. And he's been shooting his own specials and his own. He's doing
*  a reunion of the Titus show through it. And so I reached out to him and I'm going to do like a
*  live stream show where we have 10 people in the audience. And then we'll be live streaming it out
*  on YouTube on September 5th. If people want to get tickets to that. Don't stop my promo.
*  So there's 10 people in the audience. Yeah. So what do you do? Do you test those folks?
*  Yeah. Well, you know, there'll be way, not like you where you had, where I took the full test,
*  but it'll be temperature checks and waivers and they'll be wearing masks. They'll be wearing
*  masks and they'll be socially distance. Yeah. It can be done, man. You know, Texas is doing that
*  with restaurants. You can go to a restaurant in Texas. Everybody wears a mask. Simple. They
*  space the tables out. Everybody wears a mask, good ventilation, server wears a mask and they're not
*  having any problems. You know, this draconian laws they've instituted in California. This is the only
*  state where you can't go to the barbershop. Do you know that? I did not know. Every other
*  fucking state in the entire union, you can go to a barbershop, you can go to a hairdresser,
*  you can get your hair done. I don't have an issue with that. Obviously I'm bald as fuck, but I just
*  think it's crazy. This, the restrictions that the state's put on businesses, it's forcing people to
*  flee. That's part of what's going on here. That's one reason you're leaving. Yeah. I just think
*  there's too many folks here too. I think as I get older, I realize there are, there's drawbacks
*  to high population areas. There's tension in high population areas. And when things go south,
*  when natural disasters or, and you know, what we're dealing with with COVID, things along those
*  lines, it's just a bad place to be, man. It's just not safe. It's not healthy. It's not wise.
*  Like, uh, I like calmer. I like a little calmer. Cause I'm, I'm, my problem is not getting up for
*  things. Like I have a friend who lives in New York city and he loves it because like, oh, I love the
*  energy of the city. Everything's happening, moving. Yeah. I'm like, I don't need that. I got a lot of
*  energy. I need chill. I need downtime. I need, I need a place where I could, you need space.
*  You need a fortress of solitude. I need relaxation. I need a balance. And whenever I'd go to places
*  that were more rural, it was like nature and trees and shit. I always feel better.
*  I understand that. I vote. I mean, that's one of the reasons why I like where I live in the
*  Valley. Cause I like being, I've always been outside of it. When I started comedy, I started
*  coming to Portland, Oregon, but I lived in Salem, Oregon. And I would just make that 45 minute drive
*  because I did like going into a thing, doing my job and then leaving that there. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Back home. Yeah. That's how I always felt about Hollywood. I lived in North Hollywood when I first
*  got here and I just kept moving further out. And then I moved to Encino and I'm like, I gotta go
*  further out. And then I went way out. Yeah, man. Yeah, that is true. Like this lifestyle is so weird
*  if it will get you so wrapped up in other people's information and partying and doing shit. And this
*  one of the reasons like, I love, like I got my little small town Canadian wife and my son who,
*  you know, that's, that's who's been my balance the whole time is that I started comedy. My son was
*  already three years old. So he, one was like, you need to be feeding me with this and B, I don't
*  give a shit about your jokes or we're hanging out at all. So, you know, I would like to be here and
*  have you hanging out with me. Right. So that's always, I think that's one of the reasons I've
*  been able to be as successful as I am is that I was like, I don't give a fuck about hanging.
*  I don't give a fuck about, and there's a lot of fear that comes that, right? Cause people are
*  always like, Oh, I want to be part of the group. I want to be part of the clique. And if I'm not
*  hanging, I'm not part of the clique. And I was just like, well, they'll know I'm fucking good
*  at comedy. And they'll like me from that. You've never had a problem with that. I mean,
*  that's one of the things about the store. It's a real meritocracy. You'll hear people say like,
*  Oh, you know, like there's cliques there and they don't accept you. I think that's horseshit.
*  If you're funny, it doesn't, nobody gives a fuck if you're gay, straight, trans, white, Chinese,
*  black fucking Puerto Rican. Nobody gives a fuck. Are you funny? Yeah. And if you're funny, you're
*  in that place is a hundred percent inclusive. If you're funny, you're in, you know, it's, it's,
*  it's, you're accepted for what you, what the kind of heat you bring, you know, when you get on that
*  stage and light that place up, you don't have to hang out. You have to be one of the, you know,
*  one of the people that parties and drinks, they don't give a fuck. They know you're funny. Yeah.
*  I mean, I've seen you murder, you know, when you, when you can lay it down the way you do,
*  you just accepted. It's just how it is. It's a beautiful thing. Really. It's like that,
*  the art form of comedy, we all know how hard it is to get to that 14 year spot like you're at.
*  And you know, there's a lot of people that have 14 years and not as funny as you,
*  for whatever reason, psychologically, they've not figured it out artistically. They're not true to
*  themselves, whatever it is, they've never found that. And I think I bet having a child and having
*  that intense responsibility, you know, when you're starting out, you know, being an open micer and
*  also having a child like, woo, that is, that is extreme. That's an extreme amount of responsibility.
*  Yeah, I agree. And I've talked about it with the other comics that I know that our parents,
*  because we'll make fun of the laziness of other companies, because they'll be like, oh, man, I
*  got to do this set at midnight. And then I got a meeting at noon. How am I going to do it? And I
*  just be like, well, before I came to this set, I helped my son with his homework, I got to get him
*  up on the school bus at 6am. And then you know, so like, I don't have any fucking sympathy for you.
*  Yeah, well, one of the things that I loved before the store closed down was my schedule was basically
*  I would put my kids to sleep, they would go to bed at like, you know, 830, nine o'clock, and then I
*  would go over my notes. And then I'd have a set at like 1030. It was perfect. And then when I would
*  come home, everybody would be asleep. So I just hang out with the dog and write. You get a chance
*  to come down and not have anybody talk to you. Nothing, man, just quiet. That's the balance, man.
*  Yeah, that's what it's, that's what for me, that's so that's so big. Balance is so big.
*  You have to have it. You can't just be all about because I think, do you know Miyamoto Musashi was?
*  He's a samurai from the 15th century. He wrote this crazy book called the Book of Five Rings.
*  It's all about strategy and how to be the best at whatever you do. And one of the things that he said
*  is like, you have to have the same you have to do all things with the same intensity and energy.
*  Like you can't just be a guy who has to kill people with a sword. He was excellent at calligraphy.
*  He was an artist. He wrote poetry. He believed that you had to have a balance as a person.
*  Otherwise, those flaws would show up in your sword fighting. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, I love that.
*  That's, I've always that strikes me hard because I've always believed that in my comedy from the day
*  I started. I was always like, oh, I can never let my life get far away from my persona that I present
*  on stage. I can, you know, always we turning ourselves up to 11 or whatever. But I go from
*  just my experience and my level of comedy, I go, oh, when people get too far from their persona in
*  any general way and they're lying to you, it just starts falling apart and it starts showing in their
*  act and it shows in their life. And I've always that was is what gives me material because I just
*  talk about whatever is active in my life as opposed to being like, well, this is who I because if I
*  did that, I'd been stuck when I was 23 just being like, I'm the fat stoner guy. You know,
*  right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. You could get caught up in your act, right? Yes. This look,
*  there's a lot of examples of that. Even successful ones like Kinnison. Kinnison is a great example.
*  Bobcat for up until very recently. Yeah. He on this podcast talked about how hard it was to kick
*  and people like, hey, man, do that scream things like, fuck you.
*  Done, man. You didn't want to do it. Yeah, he he got stuck. He got trapped. Emo Phillips. He's
*  another one. You know, I mean, Emo is like in his fucking sixties now. He's still got to do that
*  weird sort of thing that he did when he was 20. That was kind of cute. You know, when you're 60,
*  everybody's like, man, is you having a stroke? Like, what's going on up there, buddy? Yeah.
*  And that one does still hurt me because he's such a tremendous joke writer. Yes. Amazing
*  joke writer. But I do see that. Yeah. It's like you have to kind of you can't just go up there
*  and start talking. Can't just be yourself. Yes. Yeah. Which is one point when, you know,
*  that's why I'm learning as you get into it, people start caring less and less about like,
*  oh, that's a crazy ass joke he wrote. And they want to know more about like, who is, who are you?
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Another, but we were talking about Kinnison. He was a guy who got really
*  caught up in it because his thing was partying. Like he couldn't go anywhere without partying.
*  So like guys line up giant lines of coke for me, like, oh, here we go.
*  And his heart would be beaten out of his chest and couldn't, you know, couldn't sleep for a week.
*  And this comedy was suffering like real bad. I always point to him as a great example for comedians
*  of someone who was so good for a short period of time and then was so bad afterwards. He was so good
*  around like 85, 86. That was like the louder than hell days. Like, dude, he was revolutionary. Like
*  nobody had ever seen anything like that. This short fat preacher go on stage screaming and talking
*  screaming. You ever been married? Look at me. Look at me. Like this is marriage. Oh, oh,
*  like I was married twice. That's how dumb I am. And you would see him and it was like this force
*  in nature, but with great material, great insight, great points. And then all of it went away. And
*  then it was like cheerleading. It was like weird. Like I remember he had this bit about drunk driving.
*  He's like, we're going to drink and we're going to drive and we're going to pull it off. You know why?
*  Cause we do it every fucking night. And it's like, what? Yeah. And then he was killed by a drunk
*  driver. Yeah. Which is crazy. Yeah. I hate that. I always hate when people use their charm and they
*  use their tricks to push apart false premises. You're just like, you're fucking lying. I think he was
*  just trying to do it just to be, I mean, his brother wrote about it. His brother, Bill wrote a
*  book called brother Sam was a really good book for someone who's a Kenison fan. Really interesting.
*  We talked about it pretty openly about Sam just stopped writing. His material fell apart and he
*  just became like a shadow of himself. Like a good open mic or doing a Kenison impression with like
*  shitty material. It's sad. It is, but it's a lesson for us. Yeah. You know, like you got to stay on
*  your fucking game. And then there's also the problem when people know who you are. They come
*  to see you. You know, it's Ron functions. Oh, we're going to go see him. And like, we're excited to
*  see you and everything you say, I'm happy to hear you could, you get your crowd. And the problem is
*  if you're only doing comedy to your crowd, you could really delude yourself. Oh, absolutely.
*  But I think that's why people who are good like to go around to all the different spots. I love
*  to go around and do like house parties and the comedy store and my shows on the road. You do
*  house parties? Sometimes. Like what kind of house parties? You know, they do dumbass mansion parties
*  and shit. Really? Yeah. There's a lot of weird rich comedy producers and you're just like, I don't
*  know what your life is, but I will take this money for this event and then I'll probably not see you
*  again. And you do it at the house. Yeah. How many people? Well, you know, this was way before. Yeah.
*  Be like a couple hundred people. No shit. Yeah. In the yard or something or inside? Both, you know?
*  Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of comedy. There was a lot of comedy in LA and strange places.
*  Yeah. I got invited to do a lot of yard shows. Guys would show up. Hey, man, I'm doing comedy.
*  Yeah. Best fish taco, taco restaurant. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You want to kill Cliff?
*  Want one of these? What is it? Sure. Grape CBD drink. Delicious. Good for you. No THC.
*  Well, that's okay. I can give you some THC if you'd like that too. We have plenty of that.
*  But I got those for us. Not bad. Delicious, right? Yeah. Good for you. 25 milligrams of CBD.
*  Do you take CBD at all? Yeah, I bet. Yeah. I might get some to my wife whenever her back is hurting.
*  That's one of my daily things. That's the thing that's so good for you. CBD is so good for you.
*  Anything you can do to reduce inflammation. Fantastic for the body, for the brain. I didn't
*  even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD. I'm telling you. Well, maybe you didn't.
*  Well, it's relative. I mean, I didn't have anxiety compared to people who have anxiety.
*  But I took CBD. I was like, man, I feel really relaxed. And I was like, oh, okay. I see what's
*  going on. Yeah. No, I like a good CBD. I'll just smoke just a straight CBD sometimes after a workout
*  or something. Yeah. I would say I'm going to do that. And then I grab a regular joint. Yeah. Well,
*  I'm saying I'll mix them up too. Do you ever smoke weed and then work out? Yeah. My trainer hates
*  that, but yeah. Why does your trainer hate that? He's always like, I can always tell when you high,
*  when you smoking weed. He's Dutch. So that's how he talks to me. Yeah. I had a Dutch kickboxing
*  trainer for a while. They have a different way of talking. The Dutch way. Yeah. They don't understand
*  America. They're like, you're so fat. Why do you don't have to be? What are you eating? My friend.
*  It is very simple. What kind of foods? Dutch is a weird country, Holland, because you know, like,
*  I don't know if you know this, but they have some of the greatest kickboxers of all time. All came
*  out of Holland. Real weird. Like a few guys went over to Thailand, started training in Thailand
*  and fighting in Thailand. And then they brought it back to Holland. And then Holland became like
*  this gigantic kickboxing epicenter. That's great. They didn't know that. I didn't know that. So the
*  baddest motherfuckers of all time come from Holland. Yeah. A place known for like weed shops. Yeah.
*  Red light district and mushrooms. That's why I go. That's one of my favorite places to visit. Yeah.
*  Four times I've been to Amsterdam. I've never been. I've never been. I love it. And it's not even,
*  you know, you can get just as good, if not better weed here in California for sure. But it's just
*  the vibe. It's just the lack of anyone ever being like, oh, you dumb stoner. There's none of that.
*  Like I remember I was sitting in a coffee shop and a guy tried to sneak a beer in and then they
*  kicked him out and like, no drinking. And I was like, I like it here.
*  Yeah. It's funny what we chose to allow and not allow. Yeah. Well, where I'm going in Texas,
*  you still, I mean, Austin, it's legal. Essentially they've decriminalized it to the point where the
*  cops want to arrest anybody for weed. You mean, you don't want you selling large quantities of it,
*  but it's still not legal. It's still not legal statewide. It's the dumbest thing to make illegal,
*  just to make zero sense. You know, I see, I see the argument for making alcohol illegal,
*  but I would never agree with it. I think people should be able to do whatever they want.
*  Yeah, I'm with that. The argument for weed being illegal is the dumbest.
*  Just personal responsibility. If we, but we have so many arguments that we're not really good at it.
*  Yeah. So well, we'll get what's happened with COVID. Yeah, that's the best. I mean, if you look at
*  we're so bad at it. America is so bad. Our response to COVID and how we've handled it and
*  allowed it to spread, we're the worst. Yeah. I mean, you know, I'm a big pro wrestling fan
*  and that's the thing that's been making me angry because it's just as much as I miss comedy. I
*  miss, I used to go to my wrestling shows with my friends and my buddies and now I'm watching the
*  Japanese wrestling that I love and seeing that they have full crowds all sitting there in masks,
*  just hanging out because they are good at handling their fucking business.
*  That's when it, cause when you're just sitting here, you're like, oh, well, we're all
*  falling apart and it's just how it is. But then you start looking over at other countries and you're
*  like, well, no, they, they figured some shit out. Well, this virus is so sneaky, man. Even Japan has
*  had a resurgence recently. It's so weird, man. It's the weirdest fucking virus. It's just like
*  New Zealand even had a resurgence. New Zealand had over a hundred days with zero cases and then they
*  just got it. They got about, I think it was, was it four or something like that? Got it in one,
*  one family got it. One trying to figure out how that happened. So they shut down the city where
*  they're at sort of like they at stage three or something. One family. Yeah. So one family of four
*  has it. Sneaky Fox. What have they been up to? Maybe they got some bad tests, but probably not.
*  Yeah. They're trying to trace how it happened. It's such a weird, weird, weird disease, man.
*  I know so many people that have gotten it now. I think I know about nine people and
*  so many of them have different symptoms. I know people that got it and they just got a mild headache
*  and they felt like shit for a day and then they were fine. And then I know other people that like
*  Michael Yo, who was on death's door, you know, but his, when people ask me about that, there's
*  extenuating circumstances. Like if you listen to Michael's story, he was worn the fuck out,
*  flew all the way to New York, did shows, did morning radio, did TV, flew all the way back,
*  and then got in a car with his family, drove to Vegas, hung out with his wife's mom's family,
*  hung out there for a while and then drove all the way back home same day and then had auditions the
*  next day and then had auditions the day after that and then boom, it hit him. His immune system was
*  compromised. Yes. He was wrecked. He was exhausted and low vitamin D. Vitamin D seems to be one of
*  the big factors, gigantic factor. There was a recent study that Dr. Rhonda Patrick sent me
*  yesterday that I have to go over, but one of the things that she said was that in a series of
*  studies they did where they showed people in the ICU for COVID, more than 80% of them had insufficient
*  levels of vitamin D and out of the people that were in intensive care, only 4% had sufficient
*  levels of vitamin D. Got to take your vitamin D. Do you take vitamin D? Yes, I do. Do you? How much do you take? I don't know. I just, whatever's in the bottle. Oh, one of those things. Yeah.
*  No, it's a full, wait, yeah, the D is in the multi. Yeah, so the full C, then the multi, B, something called
*  arginine that I don't know. So amino acid. Yeah, I do know that, but I don't know what that means.
*  It helps build muscle. Okay, I'm glad I'm taking it. Yeah, branched chain amino acid is a really good
*  post-workout. Yeah, take it after. Yeah, I'm supposed to take it after my workout, but before my, yes.
*  What kind of protein drink you drinking in that thing? What is that? This is just like some
*  bullshit. This is like Metrex, just regular. I'm actually, I need to figure out a better powder
*  because I just got on it and just got the basic, like, oh, this tastes chocolate. I'm pretty sure
*  it's not great, but I'm sure you can tell me some good ones. Yeah, I find hemp to be the best protein
*  powder, the most easily digestible. I have zero problems with it, digesting wise. Like, if I drink whey
*  an hour later, I got to stay the fuck away from people, otherwise I'm going to be farting. I don't tend to have
*  a problem with whey, but I always have less of a problem with hemp. That's always fine. Yeah, yeah, it's the
*  most digestible for me. I mean, it's just easy. It's also something I can eat literally. I can drink it
*  rather literally an hour before a workout and have zero problems. Just take it with a little bit of
*  coconut water, mix it up, you know, just simple, easy. You know, I use the on-it kind, but there's a
*  lot of good hemp powders out there. And it's a very absorbable, you know, it's a very bioavailable
*  form of protein in terms of plant protein. The two best I find, plant proteins or pea proteins, really
*  good, and hemp protein. I think hemp protein's a little better, at least in my experience. Okay,
*  I'm looking to some hemp protein. But Metrix is delicious. It is delicious. It's like you're getting
*  yourself a little shake. Yeah, that's what I do in the morning when I have my favorite breakfast. I
*  get a rice cake that has a little bit of almond butter and a little bit of apple butter. And then
*  I have a shake and I go, oh, I'm having shake and cake for breakfast. It's just mental games. Yeah.
*  What did you, when you first started losing weight, how much did you weigh? 360. Wow.
*  Wow. So you lost well over a hundred pounds. Yeah, one, let's see, right now be 130. Wow.
*  Wow. That's amazing. What's the ultimate goal? I'd like to be around 200 and just keep staying
*  lean and just keep putting on muscle a bit. But yeah, I'd like to lose like another 15 pounds.
*  Nice. Yeah, you could do that. Yeah, focus. Yeah. I mean, you're at the home stretch. Yeah. And
*  that's been the fucking, yeah, that's what sucks. Cause then I'm like, why can't I have a cookie?
*  And then I have one and then I realized why I can't have a cookie. Cause then I eat the whole
*  fucking box of cookies. So yeah, I can't fuck with pizza. No. If I have one slice of pizza, I just,
*  the glutton in me goes off and I just want to eat that whole thing. That abstain. Do you miss
*  traveling? I do. Yeah, actually I do. I was talking with that with my wife a couple of days ago,
*  cause we were watching some 90 day fiance and they were, what is that? You never seen it? No. Oh,
*  it's just a show. They, it's a whole, it's actually, it's a whole complex of shows where people from
*  other countries meet people in America and they get married. They have to get married within 90
*  days once they move to America. But then also we've been watching the other way on the
*  recommendation of Eric Griffin, where Americans move to other countries for their significant
*  others. And that's been insane and beautiful. It's been beautiful to watch together. Why is that?
*  It makes our relationship look so much stronger. I go, baby, we never said we had to, we should
*  start over. I never had lied to you about a gambling problem that I had, you know, it just
*  makes us look a lot better when we're watching those relationships. Um, and, but they're at the
*  airport a lot and I would go, Oh, that's PDX. Oh, that's, that's, that's, that's, and then she's just
*  like, Oh, she's like, why are you getting so excited about seeing these airports? And I was just like,
*  I think I just fucking miss the, the whole process. I just miss knowing, Oh, I'm going to a new city,
*  new people are going to see me. I might meet some new friends. Like, you know, I miss that.
*  Have you been writing? I've been writing a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Um, go ahead. What's, I'm sorry. What's
*  your process? Uh, my process is usually from like, if we're talking about from start, um, I kind of
*  work on this little grid where I just break it down into, um, love, hate and fear. And then I just
*  kind of get stoned or just sometimes not stoned at all. And I'll just play some instrumental music
*  and I'll just write about what I'm scared about, what I'm pissed about, what I'm in love with.
*  And then I didn't take those topics and try to figure out jokes about what's going on in my life.
*  That's interesting. Have you always done it that way? Yeah. Love, hate, fear. What, what, uh, where
*  did you get the inspiration to do it that way? I think I just got it from a writing workbook from
*  when I was in like an English class in high school. Really? Yeah. It was just about how you
*  would brainstorm writing a, um, paper. That's a great idea. Yeah. I mean, it helps me get the basics
*  down. So instead of like, Oh, I'm writing this joke about this. It's like, okay, I'm writing about
*  my wife because I fucking love my wife. Or I'm writing about my son or I'm scared about COVID
*  or I'm scared about this or, you know, the more specific I can get about what exactly I'm scared
*  of or I'm scared, I'm afraid of, uh, you know, or what I'm in love with. And just the more specific
*  I can get, the better the jokes are. And so it's a lot of work that way. And then sometimes at two
*  in the morning, I'll just be stoned and something will pop in and I gotta go chase down a notebook.
*  Yeah. The stoned ideas that just pop out of nowhere are the weirdest ones. Like what? That's not even
*  my idea. That's the universe. Yeah. Giving it to you. But I usually find that they, it doesn't give
*  it to me if I haven't put in that earlier work. Right. Right. Yeah. It'll give me a gift for putting
*  in the shitty work of trying to figure out this, how the fuck am I going to break this down? And
*  then in the middle of the night, some completely joke, some other other left field joke will just
*  pop in and it'll be fully formed, set up punchline, everything. And I'm just like, I was just always,
*  I'm just like, thank you. Yeah. It is crazy like that. Right. It is crazy that that's that put in
*  the work part is what, you ever read Steven Pressfield's The War of Art? It's a great book,
*  a real small book too. I used to, I buy stacks of them in the old studio and I'd just hand them out
*  to guests, like especially comics. I'm like, trust me, just read this. Because one of the things it's
*  about is about establishing the laws of your work, like the way you work, you're a professional
*  and you show up every day as a professional and you sit in front of that computer or that notebook
*  and you call upon the muse, you know, and whether or not the muse is real,
*  if you do the work, it acts as if it's real. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. I believe in that all the time.
*  Yeah. I've been talking to myself lately, just like then that's what's been keeping me with my
*  health and my writing and my meditating and whatever is just like figuring out who I am and
*  what works for me and then being like, you follow those fucking rules. Don't break your rules.
*  Whenever you break your rules, shit doesn't go right. Even though it might look cool,
*  it might look amazing, it might be like, oh, well, this time if I break my rule, it's fucking,
*  it looks like it's going to be dope and I'll get a bunch of money. Never works out. So just don't
*  break your fucking rules. And I'm just, it's still, it's hard, but I've been working on that. She's
*  like, oh, I got to eat well. I got to work out. I trust my intuition. I'm the leader. I'm the
*  fucking boss. I don't let other people lead me. I lead even if I don't know where I'm fucking going.
*  I lead and I just follow those rules. Have you had that issue with like representation,
*  like agents or managers trying to tell you what to do or guide you into a way that you didn't
*  think was you? Oh, no, no, not for me. I, I've been truly blessed in that. Truly, but I have,
*  I think I have like one of the best managers in the fucking world. Like she's amazing. She's
*  married to the game. She's, my name's Melanie Truitt, Brian Possein's wife. And she's been
*  my manager since before I moved out of LA. Like she paid my fucking rent when I couldn't afford
*  to pay my rent. Like she's looked out for me every step of the way. That's awesome. She's,
*  there's been, there's been fucking like, this show is going to series. They are making an offer on
*  you. This will give you a bunch of money, but it's not the right project. Let's fucking pass.
*  Wow. You know, and that was like in the past. And I mean, that happened a couple of weeks into
*  COVID. We were both scared shitless. I know she was scared shitless about that 10%. A guaranteed
*  season. And she was like, no, this isn't, she's like, this was, she's like, you've already done
*  parts like this three or four times. You, you, you can do this. This will be there for you. We're
*  shooting for bigger things for you. And just like her belief in me and, and drive for me have always
*  been there. Like I never ever feel like she's ever sold me short so that she can get a check ever.
*  That's huge. That's huge. It's rare. Yeah, I do. I do know that. I have many friends that have really
*  bad managers that give them terrible advice to take projects that are just short-term financial
*  gain for the sacrifice of long-term career options. Oh, my manager, if she sees the word exclusive in
*  any contract, she's just like, we ain't fucking with them. You are not exclusive to anybody. You
*  are dating around. That's great. That's, that's great attitude, man. That's what's interesting
*  about today's climate. It's like, you don't get a lot of real managers anymore. You almost get,
*  you almost have like comics who have two agents. You have your agent agent, and then you have your
*  manager who's kind of acting as an agent instead of acting as a manager because they're all
*  desperado or maybe they don't really have faith in you. So they just want that money. They don't
*  really think that you're going to be that person that has a long career or that you could keep
*  accelerating and they don't believe in the development. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like,
*  yeah, my manager has always been the, she's always kind of seen me two years ahead of where I've been
*  at. Like I'm, I have that story about recently, but I remember when I first was in Portland and
*  there was this commercial that reached out to me and they wanted me to play a roach in a fucking
*  bug spray commercial and I was broke as fuck. And she was just like, no, she's like, cause we don't
*  know what you're going to be in the next couple of years. And that commercial could be around
*  forever. Smart woman. And so if you need the money that bad, I'd rather just give you the money.
*  Good for her, man. Yeah, she's dope. And I have many friends who like, they just are tremendous,
*  tremendous comedians, tremendous joke writers. One friend who comes to mind immediately. And I've
*  always told him, I was like, you need to, you need to dump your manager and get a better manager
*  because you're doing, you're doing your part. And I don't see why you're not getting more money.
*  You're not getting more chances. You're not advancing at things. They're not putting you on
*  these talking head shows. Like you're doing your part. And I don't, you're fucking like, you know,
*  he opened for me once I was like, dude, you're fucking crushing me. And I'm the one getting the
*  bigger check. Like, what the fuck is that? Like get your, get your business in order. And I've
*  always, I think from having a kid, I've always been very much into the art and very much into
*  the business. Yeah. It's just, it's hard for people to find someone like your manager that,
*  that is dedicated. I got real lucky. I found mine when I was an open micer. I've been with the same
*  manager since 1991 or some shit, something crazy like that. Yeah. Yeah. I was like three years in
*  the comedy when I met him and I've been with him and then he's basically not, not retired,
*  but steps back. And then my manager, Chandra, she took over 10 plus years ago or more, might be more
*  than 10 years ago now. And they're just the best in terms of like seeing the big picture and the
*  same thing you're saying about your manager, just looking at the business in terms of like, where
*  do you really want to do? Like what's going to make you happy? Like there's things you can do for
*  money, but what's, what are you here for? Yeah. Like what do you want? You want, you want to like
*  walk away from everything you do going, that was great. I enjoyed that. That's what I wanted to do.
*  Like a special thank you. Good night. You want to go, we did it. We nailed it. High fives all around.
*  That's how you want to be able to achieve those moments and get those feelings. And I think,
*  I know this is unrelatable to some people that are listening to this, but I think that way
*  with everything and maybe you don't have a manager for whatever your goal is in life,
*  but you kind of have to think about it as your own manager. You got to think like, what, what do I
*  really want to do? And are the steps that I'm taking, are the things that I'm doing right now,
*  are they moving me closer to that? And if not, what the fuck do I have to do different than what
*  I'm doing? Yeah. I mean, to me that's, I have that manager. I also have my, my vision board.
*  I have my shit that I do on my own. I am. Vision board. Oh yes, Joe. What's at the top of the
*  vision board? My show. Get my own fucking show about my son being a single dad of a son with
*  autism, making it a fucking dope ass comedy. What Netflix should do that. That seems like a
*  perfect thing. You would think that seems like a really good idea for a show. I think so. We
*  found a spot. We're working on it. Okay. All right. You got to keep mum. We'll talk later.
*  Is that just more, I want to be leading some movies. I want to do more. I always see myself
*  as like this Rick Moran is Billy Crystal type of unconventional, charming leading man. And I just
*  need a buddy. I could use a boy. Yeah. You need like, you know, Christopher, like Chris Farley
*  needed David Spade, like the two of them together. They played off of each other. You need a buddy.
*  I do need a bud. Who would your buddy be? I got to think about that. Think about that.
*  That would be fun. Maybe Bobby Lee. Bobby Lee. Well, he seems crazy for a buddy. He's crazy as fuck.
*  It might be a problem. If he gets too successful, he might sabotage, go back on pills.
*  He's so wild. He's so wild. He truly is. I knew Bobby Lee in the early days when he'd like bring
*  a knife to work. I just all sweaty and shit. We were at an airport one time and he just goes,
*  oh, the courtesy phone's calling for you. And I was like, no, I don't, I've been here too,
*  Bobby. I didn't hear anything. He's like, no, no, no, it didn't. He's like, spends the whole
*  time trying to convince me and he halfway does. And then I just go sit down somewhere else and I
*  go, oh, he's a fucking high school bully. Like he just like the fucking play around. Not like
*  beat you up, but like prankster. Like he just fucks with you all the time. No, I love Bobby.
*  I'm not saying like he's trying to beat me. I'm saying he's just a prankster who fucks with you
*  all the time. And I was like, and see money, no money, nothing. Like he just is, that's who he is.
*  And I love it. Yeah. He's a guy who needs a goddamn special. I've been yelling at him forever. Now
*  he has an excuse. There's no comedy. Now he's got an excuse. But Bobby Lee is absolutely the
*  best standup comic that does not have a special. I mean, he is as legit a headliner as has ever
*  lived. When that guy is crushing, when he's in the OR crushing, you're like, the fact that he
*  doesn't have a special is criminal. Criminal. Yeah. Bobby the fuck. I mean, he's just unique.
*  He's just him. And that's to me is the definition of someone you want to give a special to. Yeah.
*  I've known that dude forever. Known him for a long time back when he was crazy, but it's nice to see
*  that he's gotten his shit together. He's calmer and more stable. Doesn't rub his balls on you as
*  much, not as much, but nearly as much. Yeah. I got a picture of him standing in the middle of the
*  hallway with his pants down and his dick tucked in between his legs. It's like, that's Bobby Lee.
*  We've all seen it. You said you meditate? Yeah. What do you do? Nothing special. Just sit around,
*  do a 10 minute little meditation when I get up in the morning. Sometimes they're guided,
*  a lot of times they're not. But I talked to, I don't know who Donnick Carey is. He's a writer.
*  Tremendous writer. Wrote for the Simpsons, wrote for Letterman. And he came on my podcast and he
*  just told me about this thing that he was doing, this acronym that he was doing every day. Mr.
*  Alway, just meditate, read, art, write, exercise every day. That was like part of his rules.
*  And so I was like, oh, I'm going to try to adapt that into my rules just as a way to keep that
*  going. So that's part of what I do. Meditate, read, art, write, exercise every day. That's awesome.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's a beautiful thing. If you can structure your life like that
*  and make sure you follow those principles, you'll just get more out of your brain.
*  Yeah. And then you're surprised about, for all the times you're bored and you're like, oh,
*  there's too many hours in a day. If you got to go through all those fucking things, you'd be like,
*  fuck, half the day is gone. Yeah. I don't understand people that say there's too many
*  hours in a day. What are you doing? I want 100 lives. I want to live 100 separate lives
*  so I can just do different. I literally don't do things because I'm scared I'll get too into them
*  and then I will have less time for all the other shit that I'm already obsessed with.
*  I'm the same way. I mull over the decision for an extended period of time because I know once I make
*  the decision, I'm all in. And that was like, you know, I started playing video games on Twitch and
*  doing these little comedy nights on Twitch where I show old videos and make fun of people. Cause
*  that's part of things that I missed was that not just watching comedy, I always, I miss it being in
*  the background of a room, making fun of this punch line or this tag and then being like, oh,
*  that's good. You know, I miss that. So I've been doing that on Twitch and playing games with people.
*  And, but it took me a long time to decide to do it. Cause I was like, oh, once I do it, I'm
*  anything. I'm stand up acting, whatever. If I choose to do it, I go full force. Yeah. You get
*  into it, right? Yeah. And then it becomes a part of your daily routine. And then you're trying to
*  get better at it. Yeah. Podcasting. Yeah, man. You're the Twitch thing. Things seems like you could
*  eat up a lot of your day. Just fucking around on Twitch. You can, do you have a good chair that
*  supports your back? I got a solid chair. I could use a better chair. I could definitely.
*  Do you like that one? It's pretty nice. Very good. Yeah. I like these good for the back. Yeah.
*  Ergonomic. You need some ergonomic. Yeah. You don't want to develop back problems cause of COVID.
*  You know, like all the people that are just sitting down all the time. Yeah. Well, that's why I'm
*  again, the two treads of the day, just to make sure keeping myself upright, moving. So when you
*  do this meditating thing, you do it every day, 10 minutes, you start your day this way. Do you go to
*  a place like quiet place in your house where no one's around? Usually do it right there in bed.
*  Make up the bed, get everything together, sit there, meditate for 10 minutes.
*  Usually try to do it before my son wakes up, before the neighbors wake up. Cause their family
*  doesn't seem to be as structurally strong as ours. Oh, you got wacky neighbors. They like
*  yelling at each other. Oh, that's a bummer. All day. And then the wife, when you know they had
*  a fight because then in the morning, the wife will come out in the morning going, I love you.
*  I love you. He's like, he's not saying it back lady. Oh no. Yeah. They're not doing well.
*  There's a trap that some people get in that fight, break up, make up trap. Cause it makes
*  everything so exciting. That's the problem. Yeah. High school. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I like,
*  you know, I got married on Friday, super chill, super chill. That's the wedding was so chill that
*  I was like, this is going to be a great marriage. Like we just got dressed. I got my son dressed
*  and went off with my friend. She got dressed with her friend. We met together at the place.
*  The guy just went over his dumb spill and then we talked to each other, went home, took some pictures.
*  We ordered in from one of our favorite restaurants. We watched 90 day fiance and then we fell asleep
*  and had sex the next morning. Cause we knew we were going to be there. Did you get married during
*  COVID? Yeah. Oh wow. This last Friday. Oh, you, Oh, well congratulations, man. Thank you. Thank
*  you so much. That's why you're so excited about it. Let me talk to you in a couple of years.
*  Well, let me show you a picture of her. I've seen a picture of her. She's beautiful.
*  Congratulations. It's one of the things about being talented. Yeah. Yeah. Box above your weight
*  class. Oh wait. Yeah. Oh yeah. I was like, Oh, if I didn't do comedy, I'd never even see you.
*  That's cool though. That's a bright spot. You'll always look back on the time you got married and
*  go, damn, we got married during one of the weirdest times in the history of the United States.
*  Yeah, man. Leaning into what solid when shit's all falling apart. That was actually like,
*  got engaged before it of course, but I was like, Oh, I'm pretty sure I was a little gun shy.
*  Cause I've been, I got married when I was in my twenties and obviously that didn't work out too
*  well. And I had my son and I remember leaving my home there and I was like, just will never happen
*  again. I will, you know, and it still will never happen again. But, um, I was still a little gun shy,
*  but cause I was like, Oh, we were in the good times. We go to Nice, we go to fucking wherever.
*  And sure we'd hang out at home or we just, she'd go on set with me and some indie movie in Oklahoma.
*  We still have fun. And so I knew she was a good woman. I knew that I could trust her, but
*  especially when the shit goes down and everything's going bad and she's out there like, okay, well,
*  what do we do? What do we need to pull back on? What can we purchase less of? And then I thought
*  I might have to go out of the country for this role for a few months. And I was like, Oh shit,
*  I'll leave my son with her. And I had no worry. And I was like, even, you know, when he was with
*  his mom, I would be worried, you know, but with her, I know she's got him. I know she loves him.
*  I know she's got his best interest at heart. And I was that really was when it clicked in and I was
*  like, Oh, this is my wife. Like, this is my person. That's beautiful. I love stories like that. Thank
*  you. That's amazing. Congratulations. Yeah. She's special. She's special person. I think cause she's
*  a little small town Canadian lady. So she doesn't know how hot she is, you know? Yeah.
*  Yeah. That could be a problem here. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, she's figured it out.
*  She figured it out. It's like guys, you know, try to hit on her every fucking day, but
*  I'm not worried. Good for you. Good for you. I wonder when this is going to end the lockdown.
*  When are we going to get back to normal? Are you going to be one of the first in line for a vaccine?
*  Are you going to wait it out? I got to wait in the middle. I got to be somewhere in the middle
*  as a parent of a child with autism. Vaccines scare me in some ways, but it's still obviously.
*  Do you think that vaccines cause autism? I don't believe they cause autism. I believe they can
*  accelerate certain things and people who maybe are predisposed to having it. And I can only just
*  tell you my, I will tell you a personal story and people can choose to like it or not. But I just
*  remember the day that we got my son, his first vaccine vaccinations and he had been developing
*  normally and just been chill and been talking and doing all the things pretty normally.
*  And then we got him the vaccine and me and my ex-wife and we just remember he just kind of like
*  was out of it. And we even, cause me and my ex-wife are big potheads. We were both like,
*  oh, he's look how stoned he looks. Look how fucking he looks so stoned and he's out of it,
*  but he never came back. And so that was a moment where I was like, you know, I was like,
*  I don't know if it calls it or that, but I've always like, this is, that's the story I can tell you.
*  Wow. It's not the first time I've heard that. You know, I have a friend,
*  my friend Johnny, in a very similar situation. I don't, yeah, I don't know. I know how adamant
*  the people that make vaccines are that vaccines don't cause autism. And I know it's a fiercely
*  debated issue. And in fact, Dr. Peter Hotez, who is an expert in vaccines, who actually has an
*  autistic daughter, is adamant about the fact that there's apparently different environmental
*  factors that contribute to autism. And they think it all of it takes place during the womb,
*  but I don't know. I can never be like, well, vaccine gave my son autism. I would never say that,
*  but I will just tell you that story. Yeah. The thing is, if that story, if that was the case,
*  how much do you think would ever get out that all these people who have this similar story,
*  all have a case against the pharmaceutical companies? I mean, do you just wrap your mind
*  around the legal troubles? And I'm not saying that vaccines cause autism, but what I am saying is,
*  if they did, there would most certainly be an effort to conceal that. Yeah, absolutely.
*  Most certainly. Absolutely. That would be a crazy lawsuit. Because I mean, how many children
*  are autistic in this country? Do you know? I don't know, but I know it's a lot. It's a lot.
*  And the question is, the question has always been, are there more now because fathers are older,
*  mothers are older, environmental factors, or that we're diagnosing it now, we didn't diagnose it
*  before, we didn't understand it before. I mean, the first I even heard of autism was Rain Man.
*  Remember the Dustin Hoffman movie? That was the first time I ever heard about it. I didn't even
*  know what it was. I never met anybody who had autism. So I saw that and I was like, huh,
*  what's going on there? Yeah, same to me. I never thought about it, never had any
*  second thought about it at all until my son was diagnosed and then had to become much more aware
*  about it. And it's still a thing that I get hit with because I'm just a dummy. Because I'll be
*  like, okay, my son's got his high school and he's doing well and he's going to his classes. And then
*  they had to actually sit there and they go like, okay, you know, he's getting a certificate, but
*  you know, this isn't a real, he's not a real high school graduate. And I'm like, oh, oh, what? You
*  know, I know he's a high school graduate. I want my son to go to college. And then I have to sit
*  back and go like, oh, wait, fuck, I have a, we have a different road, we have a different life.
*  And actually, this lockdown and everything has really been helpful and going through that and
*  just being like, well, everything's fucking weird and different. And because it always been like,
*  well, no matter what I'm going to pick, my son wants to go to UCLA. So I'll pay to go to him to
*  go to UCLA, even if it's just life classes or whatever. But now I've been thinking about more
*  like, okay, let's just figure out a way for him to be more independent on his own, physically,
*  financially, whatever he can do. He might not go to college. He might go to college. But you know,
*  again, if I make my show, I'm like, he's got to be a consultant on this show. He's got to do this,
*  he's got to do that. I just want him to have a good life, basically.
*  Of course. Is there anything that helps him? Like does anything alleviate some of his symptoms?
*  I mean, just the constant therapies that he's been in, he like he's been at, he's done those
*  when he was two, he's 17 now. So he's been in school since he was two, just doing different,
*  you know, from pre kindergarten therapies to voice therapy. And I just think it's been that
*  constant right now he's getting a lot of social skills therapy where he was before everything got
*  locked down. He was in this thing called the miracle project, which is awesome. They just take
*  kids from with different backgrounds and teach them social skills, take them on different outings.
*  And my son was doing a play, which unfortunately got canceled because of it. But they sent us a
*  tape of the rehearsal and it fucking was dope because it was the day I got found out I wasn't
*  getting this role. And I was real upset. It was on my vision board of like, I want to fucking get
*  this role and didn't get it. And I was pissed off and doing the same thing like, fuck Hollywood.
*  They don't understand. They don't understand how good I am. And then I just watched my son and
*  all these other autistic teenagers do this, their own production of a play. It's the silliest thing
*  I've ever seen. My son is singing the SpongeBob theme song. Another kid is singing a Drake song
*  and just seeing them go from being these awkward in their shell, not looking down, looking at the
*  floor and then the moment that they're actually interested in something. You know, my son hears
*  this song play or are they know it's their turn to say their line, them light up and fucking just
*  nail their line and be fucking great at it. And I was like, man, that's what art is. That's what
*  fucking that's what I love is I don't give a shit about money about it. I mean, it's nice to pay my
*  bills, but I like this feeling that I get from it and watching my son get to do it and just makes
*  me feel good. I'm sorry. This is a rambly ass story. No, no, no, that's not rambly at all, man.
*  You're expressing yourself. That's not rambly at all. Yeah. I mean, sometimes you need to be
*  exposed to different things just to put it into perspective, just how fortunate we are and how
*  fortunate, you know, how easy we really do have it and how good we really have it. And sometimes,
*  you know, when you have ambitious goals and you have, you know, your eyes are on the prize,
*  you got a vision board and you're like, fuck, why isn't this happening for me? Sometimes you got to
*  see some struggle. You got to see people that just aren't doing that well to realize like, oh,
*  oh, I'm all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've been made very well aware of that. I'm fucking
*  doing extremely well. Extremely. That's one of the best things I think about COVID. Initially,
*  I mean, it just took too long. It's been too fucked up now. But initially I felt like
*  one of the good aspects of having this thing where you're forced to stay home and everybody's
*  worried about a disease is like, you realize like, hey, family, friends, loved ones, this is
*  what's important. All this other bullshit is like, when the world is falling apart,
*  the love that you have for your family and your friends, that's what's important.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It felt good like that for a couple of weeks and then everybody felt like they started
*  tearing at each other. They got scared. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, God, social media is so fucking
*  terrifying now. Just dive into this pit of animals eating each other. It's like,
*  everyone's so angry. There's so much anger. And then also it's like the worst timing ever,
*  right? Trump and then the fucking elections are coming. So there's all this chaos and
*  Joe Biden can't talk and the fucking, you know, November's around the corner. It's like, oh my
*  God. And then everything's still locked up and it's like, oh my God. And they're talking about
*  dropping down the unemployment check to 400 bucks that a 600 and then they want the states to pay
*  25%. The states like we don't have the fucking money. Like, oh Jesus. Yeah. It's fucking nuts.
*  It's fucking nuts. But then, you know, it's overwhelming to you guys go to the basics of it.
*  That's something I always believe from when I was very young. And I think it's something as a young
*  African American man, you know, pretty early where you just go, nobody's got my fucking back.
*  I got to take care of me. Yeah. No one's got my fucking back. The government does not have our
*  back. Not at all. It's not possible. Not one bit. We have grossly overestimated their ability to
*  actually like manage something like this. Yeah. Which is an intern. Why? Like I've seen what we
*  see in that social media of us eating each other and going at each other, especially anyone of
*  that is considered of any stature. I mean, I see it happen to you all the time, right? Where people
*  coming at you for one thing or another. And I laugh about it because I'm just like, it's just
*  fucking Joe. Who cares if he doesn't like video games? Fuck. I don't care. The problem is they
*  didn't even listen to what I said. Yeah. Yeah. It took a chunk of what I said and took it out of
*  context. I love video games. That's the problem. Yeah. Yeah. But I even talked about in that same
*  clip and we wound up putting the full version of it online because someone had taken like a
*  52nd chunk of it. But I even talked about those people that do make a living out of it. A lot of
*  money. There are people that do it. Yeah. But I'm saying for a lot of people that waste, if you want
*  to do something else, like if you're trying to do something with your life, you can find things that
*  will waste all of your time. And that's one of them. Yeah. Well, I mean, I like streaming and I
*  like playing games, but it's also a reason why I do the comedy and I do other things is because
*  I think at the very base of it, there's no stability of trying to make your living off
*  of someone else's product, right? You're playing someone else's game. You're doing something. It's
*  not yours, you know? So at any moment that can be taken away from you. And so that on that small
*  level is what I believe in what you were saying completely. But I think the reason why people
*  attack so much is because the people who we're told are like supposed to be our leaders are
*  obviously not. And then people are just looking for leaders. So if you have a big platform,
*  they're just like, oh, you're a leader. You're, you know, and then I had people do that to me.
*  I was when the whole George Floyd thing was happening and Breonna Taylor was happening.
*  One guy in particular just kept DMing me and being like, when are you going to talk about it?
*  When are you going to talk about it? When are you going to make a post about it? And what he
*  didn't know is I was going through my own personal shit, a friend of mine had committed suicide that
*  very week in a home that I had lived in three years prior. And I was fucking dealing with that
*  and dealing with my own life. And so I was like, you know, who gives a fuck when I talk about
*  anything? Like, and I have no obligation to talk about anything. And so it pissed me off. But then
*  I thought about it and I go, oh, he's not fucking mad at me. You're gonna give a shit about me.
*  He's scared. He's scared shitless. And he's looking for someone to lead him. And he was
*  hoping it would be me. But there's also people look for an opportunity to get upset at you for
*  not complying. Like that there's a narrative where you're supposed to be discussing whatever's in the
*  news, whatever's going on. There's a narrative that you are, you know, you're a person who talks,
*  so you should be discussing these things. Yeah, you're a public figure. So you should you should
*  lend your voice because they think you should. This is the dumbest fucking thing ever. Because
*  you're just like, well, how do you assume I think about black? I'm a black man. I would like my life
*  to matter. So why do I got to go around talking about it for fucking all day? You know, it makes
*  that's gumming up the works takes up too much fucking time. I agree with that completely.
*  You should be able to talk about whatever you want. One of my favorite follows on Instagram is
*  Lil Duval. Oh, yeah. And little Duval through all this craziness. He's just maintaining being
*  little Duval and having fun. That's not like him. Always, always, always lighthearted,
*  having a good time, always laughing. His Instagram is like one of the most consistently happy thing
*  and like that shows his character. Like through all this, he's maintained his sense of humor
*  and his perspective. Yeah, that's power. That's power. Why would you ever let someone take that
*  away from you? We're here to have fun. We're here to have a good time. So no matter what the
*  circumstances, I'm gonna have a fucking good time. I learned that in my sets long ago when I was
*  like, well, you guys might not have a good time tonight, but I will. Yeah, sometimes you have to,
*  right? You have to go internal. I am really interested to see like how we recover from this.
*  I'm really interested to see because we're in such uncharted territory. This is a this is new
*  waters and it could go good or it could go bad. I mean, every single republic, every single empire
*  that has existed before the United States has crumbled. All of them, they all crumble eventually.
*  My fear is the ones that are strong, why we are falling apart are dangerous. They're dangerous
*  societies that are dictatorships like China. If China somehow or another becomes the way they're
*  controlling Hong Kong, controls the United States, we got real fucking problems on our hands. Now,
*  I don't know if that's really possible. If this is just like some fear. We see bits of it all the
*  time, right? Yeah. In business, you see the way that these so-called independent enterprises
*  refuse to speak on certain things because there's just so much money involved. You know,
*  like at that point you are owned. Yes. Did you ever see that thing where the World Health Organization
*  guy won't talk about Taiwan, won't even mention Taiwan? He's in an interview because China does
*  not recognize Taiwan. They believe Taiwan is a part of China and Taiwan thinks it's independent.
*  So the woman interviewer was asking this guy who works for the World Health Organization,
*  Taiwan has done a wonderful job of handling this and he's like,
*  click, it just disconnects. And then he comes back. Like you could see him reach over
*  and disconnect it. She goes, well, we seem to have disconnected. He goes, but now we're back. So
*  what I was saying was that China, well, China has done a wonderful job. You know, there's no need
*  to talk about that any further. So let's keep going. It's like, would not even say the word Taiwan.
*  And like, this is the World Health Organization. Like you won't, you won't say the name of an actual
*  country. Like really? That, that's bananas. Like, well, I can't trust you. No, you won't even say
*  Taiwan. What the fuck else won't you say? You know, I mean, there's, there's been a few of those things,
*  man. What you see and you go, God damn, just so many businesses have a vested interest in,
*  in China and keeping relationships with China. And while COVID is happening and the economic
*  downturn, they've been buying up shit left and right. Oh yeah. I mean, cause there's again,
*  as a big gamer, Tencent is big in the game industry as owners of just about everything.
*  And that's one of the, you know, one of the biggest companies in China. What do they make?
*  Everything. Like what games? I think they own Fortnite now. They own a bit of a pub G I believe
*  they, they own just, they own percentages of just about every company. God damn. And China owns them?
*  Yeah. Wow. I don't know how I feel about that.
*  Like when Trump was saying he's going to ban TikTok, I was like, Ooh, I want to see how this
*  plays out. Yeah. Yeah. That was actually, I was like, Oh, this, that's, that's positive.
*  In a way it is, but then Instagram came along with reels. Yeah. Like their TikTok ripoff.
*  I don't know who's using that though. Is anybody using reels? I keep an eye on you.
*  It's a little busy to pay attention to that shit. Yeah. We've had a busy week.
*  Do you do TikTok? No, man. No, no, no. I, you know, I figured you, you shouldn't be a comedian over
*  30 on TikTok. That seems to not go well. It seems like it doesn't go well.
*  Someone just got a special off doing it basically though. Who? Sarah Cooper just got a Netflix
*  special. What? Oh, was that, you sent me that. Yeah. That's the lady who lip syncs. I wonder who that is.
*  She lip syncs Donald Trump's speeches. Oh, okay. That's going to go good. I'm excited for that.
*  It is, there's many things that are viral that I understand. That is not one of them.
*  I've watched that. I was like, she's just saying what he's saying, but she's doing it.
*  Like there's nothing else to it. But she's a standup? Oh no. No. What does she do? She just do that?
*  She just hosted Jimmy Kimmel like two nights ago. What? I saw that. That's why I was like,
*  cause I looked her up and I go, Oh, I don't know who that is. Maybe she's not good. But then I saw
*  the Jimmy Kimmel thing. So then I go, Oh, maybe this whole time she'd been grinding and I just
*  did not know. Nope. I thought as far as I know, I looked into it. What does she do? She a writer
*  or something? Oh yeah. She's a writer. Oh, she's a comedy writer? Uh, it's her. When I Google says
*  she's an American author and comedian based in New York city. First book, a hundred tricks to appear
*  smart and meetings was published in 2016. Hmm. She's a writer. Okay. Maybe. Who knows? I mean,
*  listen, she might have a fucking Netflix special that turns out amazing. I heard Seth Meyers.
*  Either way she gets a good check. I'm happy for her. Somebody told me Seth Meyers Netflix special
*  was very good and he's, I don't think he's really a standup, right? That's on his background. He was
*  an SNL guy and then he hosted that late night show. But I talked to people that said his special was
*  very good. I haven't seen it. I just want to see Sam J's. That's the only one I want. I haven't
*  watched it, but I want to. Which who's Sam J. Do you know her? Um, I do. Yes. Yeah. She's a writer
*  for SNL. Uh, powerful black butch lesbian. Yes. That's right. That's right. That's right. Yeah.
*  Great joke writer. Yeah. I've met her at the store. I believe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  There she is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Looks a lot like me. Looks like my
*  sister. Yeah. The Netflix. She looks like my tougher brother.
*  The Netflix thing is so interesting because they've basically taken over the standup comedy
*  special now. Yeah. Interesting. I mean, it used to be Comedy Central. It's really Comedy Central.
*  They're like getting people to watch the streaming online Comedy Central specials. It's just not the
*  same. Yeah, I know. And then they geo block that shit. So. Oh, do they really? Yeah. Oh, no. So like
*  if you're in the UK, you can't watch it. Oh, no. I don't know why that's a smart decision. That's a
*  terrible decision. Who made that one? Someone higher than the people I talked to. So your special
*  that you did for Comedy Central. That's the, the geo block that. Yeah. The geo block that. And then
*  they put it up. So now it's actually, it's out on YouTube for free right now for 30 days. So I was
*  stoked. I was like, Oh, people in Canada and the UK can finally see it. And then I was getting
*  messages being like, no, we can't. Oh, wow. Yeah. That's stupid. It's not the best decision.
*  Just not to confuse what we were just talking about her. She's not have a standup special.
*  According to the press release, it's a comedy special that will be full of vignettes dealing
*  with issues of politics, race, gender, class, and other subjects. Oh, oh, okay. Short interview
*  sketches and more shenanigans. Oh, so she's a writer. She put, she wrote something,
*  a sketch show event. Yeah. But it's, I just got, I felt it was weird to me that two things are
*  going viral because she was just lip syncing things the president had said. So it would be like the
*  president's voice and it'd be her lip syncing it. And everybody be like, this is amazing. And I'm
*  like, she's, she's not, she's just saying the words with her lips while he talks. Like what's
*  missing something? Yeah. Well, you know, we, we were around a comedy a lot. That's what I always
*  have to remember is that my palette is, you know, more refined. Yeah. I think it's also like,
*  there's a gene for certain things. You know, like I don't have that Grateful Dead gene.
*  People love the Grateful Dead. They love it. They love it. I listen, I go, okay, I don't want to be
*  mad. I just, you, you and I are different. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah. No need to be angry.
*  Yeah. I had no love. I didn't know. I don't, I can't, no, I couldn't tell you a song.
*  Trucking got me. That's a good one. Got the chips cash. Well, you said you didn't like them,
*  but you really got into it. I tried to sell it. I don't want to tell you in touch of gray.
*  They had some cool ass Nike shoes they put out recently. I want it. Yeah. But they, oh yeah.
*  Then they went up to like $1,200 real quick. Yeah. So I was like, that's,
*  that's out of my COVID price range for sure. Yeah. It's a lot of white people that do acid.
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Rich white yuppies wanted those shoes for sure. For sure. Oh Jesus.
*  You tell, you know, I want those. Oh, those are pretty trippy. The green ones come on.
*  They do look pretty trippy. Really weird. Put those on this comedy store stage. Come on.
*  What's up with the bear? I think that's their logo. A bear. Yeah. I looked into it one time
*  because I didn't know either. He's named after the, they're like engineer who was one of the guys
*  that developed LSD, I think something like that. What? Yeah. I'll pull up his name again. Just a
*  second to show you one of the guys, but Albert Hoffman synthesized LSD. Right. But I'll care.
*  So he's like a guy who worked with Hoffman. When I looked it up, he said it hit like somewhere in
*  the range of like 4 million hits of acid he's responsible for. Wow. I wonder how many ideas can
*  directly be traced to that guy's work. The lot of ideas will come to you through acid. I never
*  done acid. Want to do it now? Okay. You should try micro dosing it. I'd be, I'd be up to it.
*  It's interesting. I like mushrooms. Owsley Stanley. He's a clandestine chemist, an audio
*  engineer and clandestine chemist. He was a key figure in the San Francisco Bay area hippie movement
*  through the 1960s and played a pivotal role in the decades counterculture. So he supplied the acid.
*  Probably worked for the CIA, this motherfucker. Five million doses.
*  Oh, Stanley was first known, was the first known private individual to manufacture mass quantities
*  of LSD by his own account between 65 and 67 only in two years. He produced no less than 500 grams
*  of LSD, accounting to a little more than 5 million doses. His professional name was Bear. Oh,
*  interesting. So that's why. So they're just like tied to LSD, the dead. That's why you got to list
*  and he's the engineer that engineered the music. So that's why they say you have to be on that shit
*  to understand the sound. Yeah, that's what they say. I mean, everyone I know who does acid loves
*  the dead when they're on acid. He developed the whole, it's called the wall of sound sound system.
*  He developed one of the largest. I thought that was Phil Spector. He, that's a different thing,
*  but. Oh, he has an own wall of sound. Yeah. This Phil Spector case is one of the creepiest Hollywood
*  cases ever. Oh, I remember when he got arrested and then I didn't really know who he was. And I
*  did a deep dive into who he was after he got arrested for murder. And apparently just, that
*  was his thing, like pulling guns on people. But when you see him in the trial with all his crazy
*  wigs on, you realize like this crazy motherfucker was involved with some of the biggest bands,
*  some of the best music. And he was a psychopath like the entire time. Yeah. But I think especially
*  back then, even now, our type of businesses can kind of hide those people, right? They don't,
*  I've always hung out with as long as they've done comedy. I was like, oh, that guy's a drug dealer.
*  This guy does, but that guy's Jesus. Just to clarify too, his wall of sound is a production
*  formula to make records. Whereas the engineers was an actual like wall of sound of physical sound
*  amplifier speakers that was touring around the country to make noise to blast in your face.
*  Oh, okay. So he had both called the same thing. Okay. So he had developed something for touring
*  that they called the walls. Okay. Yeah. I don't know jack shit about music. Do you play any
*  instruments? No, never played piano when I was very young, but no. Yeah. That's another one of
*  those things where I feel like if I got into that and start playing guitar or something like that,
*  like how long that seems like a long road. Yeah. You got to choose. It has to be your passion.
*  And never I picked up an instrument. It always felt real foreign. It never felt at home at all.
*  Yeah. It's, but it seems like a dope thing to learn. Yeah. Like I wish I could shred.
*  I just wish you could play something on a piano. It seemed like, you know, people just fall in
*  love. If you could play the piano, you'd be sophisticated. Yeah. You just sit down some
*  place and you just start playing the piano. Right. You walk into a hotel and there's a hotel lobby.
*  There's a nice bar there with a piano. You're like, let me sit down and play you a melody.
*  Yeah. And everybody starts gathering around you. They think you're cool. That's a thing,
*  but that's like a, that scene in animal house with a dude's playing the guitar at a party.
*  And, uh, remember that scene? Do you remember the scene? It's a little,
*  now you could tell I was blanking. I know what you're talking about because it's an old joke,
*  but I, uh, I'm not big animal house guy. Yeah. He steals a guitar from smashes him over the head
*  with it or did he, no, it didn't smash him over the head with it. You broke the guitar. Yeah.
*  Yeah. This scene.
*  Can we get a little volume? John Paloo she's listening to this guy playing this horrible
*  folk music. Yeah, I know people will, YouTube will have an issue. Google those words. You'll find it
*  it. Back in the day when this is what everybody wanted to do. Sorry. Did you ever see animal
*  house? Yeah. Probably when I was young. Don't remember. Call it. It's a classic. That's what
*  it seems very slow. Now it is. That's the problem. There's a lot of those movies that just don't hold
*  up. I tried to watch Porky's the other day. Yeah. I was like, this is a rape movie. That's a two
*  things get announced yesterday that for the projects, maybe they won't get made, but three men
*  and a baby remake and then a potential fresh Prince reboot, but a drama, not a comedy. What?
*  Yeah. What? Why can't they just come up with new ideas? I agree with that. Listen, how about a show
*  where there's a comedian who has an autistic kid? Sounds great. Yeah. It should be like a Netflix
*  thing or maybe Amazon prime. They do a good job. You ever seen the marvelous Mrs. Maisel? I have
*  not. It's very good, especially the first two seasons. I kind of, it kind of soured for me the
*  third season, but it's a pretty good representation of standup. I mean, not perfect, but pretty good.
*  Pretty good. Like close enough where you go, huh? That's just funny hearing you that you watch that
*  show. Cause I don't think anybody would think that you will watch that show. Why is that? Cause
*  it's just funny. Like Joe Rogan just going like, you know what I like? Barberless Mrs. Maisel.
*  I like a lot of girly shit. I do. Well, then you got to get on that 90 day fiance. I don't know
*  if I can go that far. Think about it. I like Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Yeah, that's my shit.
*  That's the optimistic and charming. Come on. That's a funny fucking show though, right? Yes.
*  That's a good show. And that's like, they got like eight seasons. Yeah, that was a good one. I mean,
*  and so bleak, you know, that's the type of shit I like when you can take bleak things and still be
*  so funny. The bleakest. I mean, someone who got kidnapped and forced into a sex cult in a fucking
*  bunker. And then 15 years later, she gets out with a super positive attitude and is facing all the
*  modern world's issues. Yeah. It's fucking great. She's such an amazing actress. Yeah. Well, it's
*  a Tina Fey show too, that lady. She figures shit out. She sure does. So this vision board,
*  this ultimate vision board, the ultimate thing is a show and movies and stuff like that. Is there
*  anything that you have made manifest that's actually happened because of this vision board?
*  Yeah. Yeah. My house was one of my first major vision board things. I put that when I didn't
*  have a house living in my apartment. And what it does for me is just kind of, it focuses me,
*  gives me a direction instead of just being this guy who doesn't have his hands on the rudder or
*  whatever the fucking thing that steers the boat. And so like, I was like, Oh, I want to get this
*  house. And so in order to get the house, I had to stop just like, not paying attention to my money.
*  I had to stop just buying random sneakers every week. I had to start being like, okay, I need to
*  build my credit. I had to pay these old bills from when I was 20 and didn't pay those off
*  because I didn't think I'd ever have fucking money. So who cares if I skipped out on this rent?
*  You know, I had to go back and undo all these things so that I could get to that ultimate
*  vision of getting a house. And then we end up, I have had my house for two years now. I fucking
*  love it. I put that I wanted to be on Reno 911 in there and I taped that. I don't know if I got
*  cut out or not because it's, you know, six minute quibi thing. But a lot of things I put on my vision
*  board end up happening. That's interesting to say that you had to go and like redo
*  things that you fucked up. Like what made you, what brought you to that decision?
*  Was just that if I wanted to move on a lot of ways in my life, the same with my like,
*  dealing with my ex wife and things like that, I had to go to therapy. I had to start,
*  I wasn't trusting anyone. I was like, anyone who wants to hang out with me is just because I have
*  a little bit of money or because I've been on a couple of shows or didn't that. And which is so
*  ridiculous. Like, no, most people don't even fucking know me, you know? So, but some people did. And
*  sometimes that would happen. People will be hanging out with me just because they thought I could
*  introduce them to a fun party or someone else cooler than me. And I had to stop looking for that
*  and being so worried about that. And I had to go undo just a mindset. I think this rapper, I also
*  really like Waka Faka Flame. Many people talk about this. I just changed my mindset from a
*  survival mindset to a thrive mindset of like, oh, I am okay. I am fine. So I can go ahead and just
*  take care of this business. I'm going to get more work. I'm going to get more jobs because I've
*  proven myself is not a fluke. You know, it's not a one. It's not a mistake that they made in hiring
*  me. They, you know, I'm going to be here. What made you like, what, where, where did you come
*  up with this idea to sort of correct your mindset? Was it just like realizing personally that the
*  way you were looking at things was wrong or did you read something or? It was just mostly that
*  things in my life were getting better, but I wasn't getting happier. I had more money. I had
*  anything I could buy video game wise, all that stuff. I was having a bunch of sex,
*  but I wasn't happier. I was still lonely. I was still like, um, not doing all the things I wanted
*  to do. I was, I was chasing things just for money, you know? Um, and so I had to just kind of take a
*  step back and go like, okay, like don't just chase every single thing you see, figure out what you
*  really go back to like when you started standup and like, what do you want? And all I wanted when
*  I started standup was to be able to pay my bills and do the things I want to do. And that hasn't
*  changed. Was this a gradual process? Yeah, for sure. For sure. Like a couple of years. So you
*  just realized, was it like you're sitting at home? This was not from reading anything? It's just from
*  you recognizing that something was wrong? It was me recognizing something was wrong in me and me
*  watching the people around me, me watching, um, people with more success than me, me watching
*  just seeing that like, oh, like, okay, I feel this way and I have this little bit of money with it,
*  but maybe if I get more money, I won't. But then meeting people with millions of dollars and being
*  like, oh, holy shit, like some people still don't have their shit together no matter how much money
*  they have. And some people know exactly who they are and they know what they want. They are,
*  they are happy within themselves. And I wanted to be that.
*  It's very interesting that you recognize it and made the adjustment. You know, that's a sign of
*  a strong mind. You were able to recognize that the current patterns that you were operating under
*  they weren't fulfilling your needs. So you had to like assess, but then also move forward and make
*  a change. That's a very difficult thing to do. Yeah, it's difficult. But- Does that coincide with
*  weight loss? Um, it's probably a little bit after the weight loss, but that's the weight loss kind
*  of gives me the motivation for it. You know, like my whole life has been motivation for every other
*  step I take, you know, like I came from just being a college dropout with a son who when I was 20,
*  he was diagnosed with autism. I was 23. I didn't have any money. My ex-wife was more of an albatross
*  around our thing. Like, you know, I have full custody of my son. So it was just like, I got
*  to figure this shit out. And once that we had a little apartment and everything, I was like,
*  okay, well, I fucking figured this shit out. I get my health together. And that was a big one.
*  Because my, my doctor even told me, she was like, you know, there's so many people I tell all the
*  time, just diet, exercise, diet, exercise. You need to lose weight. You need to get better. You're
*  gonna die. I tell this to people all the time. And you go, you know how many of my fucking patients
*  have done anything about it? And then she says, you, that's it. You're the only one that I know
*  that I've talked to about this who's just done it through diet and exercise. So you have a,
*  she was just like, you have a strong fucking mind. So I took that to heart and I was like,
*  well, fuck if I can do that, if I can lose 140 pounds, fucking throw it, you know, I would work
*  out throw up in my, you know, give this more to my trainer. He would just be like, all right,
*  you throw up. Can you breathe? All right, let's get back at it. You know, you know, where a lot
*  of times people would throw up and they'd be like, okay, well that was enough for today. You know,
*  he would never push. He told me day one, he's like, you're, you're a very strong man and we're
*  gonna just unlock what you've been covering up with bad decisions. That's, it's so true what
*  your doctor said. And it's so interesting when you think about the goals that people have, like one
*  of the major goals, if you asked Americans, like what do you want to do besides be successful,
*  have a family, have a career, they want to lose weight. But what I said at the beginning of this
*  podcast, you've done one of the most difficult things a person could do because you didn't just
*  lose weight. He lost a fuckload of weight and he kept it off. And that to me is so, it's such a,
*  it's the craziest thing is because it's like, it's not like gaining weight, right? Like gaining
*  weight requires you got to eat all that food. Like you got to like, you got to really get after it.
*  Like if you really want to gain weight, man, you got to fucking put on that, you know, you got to
*  be there to eat, you got to get it done. People have no problem with that, you know, but the not
*  eating, you're literally asking someone to not do something, just don't do something. And it's
*  harder to do than to do something. And then the exercise is maybe even harder to do than to not
*  eat. Those are two really difficult things to do that you need to do both of them in order to really
*  get your health in order in order to really lose weight. And everybody knows it. Everybody knows
*  it, but nobody does it. Yeah. And then they always want to know what's the trick? What's the trick?
*  What's the trick? No fucking trick, bro. There's no trick. Trick is to walk through that door.
*  It's basically exercise. It is just like a door. Like, yeah. And that's what my wife said to me.
*  Oh, she was like, oh, you went from, she's like, you were a guy who didn't exercise and now you're
*  a guy that exercises. She's like, there's no part of you that gets up and goes, oh, this is hard.
*  Why am I doing this? She's like, this is what you do because this is what you do. And the hardest
*  part is making that transition because you go through that first three weeks and you're just
*  like, I fucking hate this. Why the fuck am I doing it? You're looking at, you know, back when we could
*  go to gyms, you're looking at other people going, oh, well they're fucking attractive and this and
*  that. And I'm not, yeah. And I'll never be like that. You know, and you just gotta get rid of all
*  that. I hate that. I hate it when I see that in comedy because I just mostly because I'm used to,
*  I go, I know where it comes from. And I had that in myself when people were like,
*  I don't exercise. And they're so fucking proud of it. You know, I'm just like, well, okay,
*  we'll see you in 10 years when you change your fucking mind and are, you just aren't successful.
*  So, you know, that's the thing. Yeah. That's the only thing I would tell young me, like everything
*  I've done. I'm like, well, that's my process and I'm glad everything I wouldn't change a thing. The
*  only thing I would have done is told young me, like, hey motherfucker, if you want to be successful,
*  you just gotta be healthy. So just get at it. It's just better for your brain too, man. You
*  think better. Yeah. I mean, I am very fortunate in that I got into exercise and working out very,
*  very young and I've never not done it. But for me, if I don't do it, I don't think right. I'm just,
*  and I think it's also, it has to be because I've been doing it so long that my brain has this
*  requirement to burn off this energy. And that also the kind of exercise I do is so intense.
*  There's so much aggression that if I don't do that for a few days, that shit stores up and then,
*  then I'm not the nicest person. I don't like me. If I don't work out for four or five days,
*  I don't like me. I'm not, I'm not that nice. I can get edgy real quick, but if I work out every day,
*  I'm the nicest person. I want, I'm just, it's like real simple. Like the body has requirements. The
*  mind has requirements. If you don't give it those requirements, it starts to malfunction.
*  Yeah. It's something I've thought about since I was very young, just as our society that we've
*  kind of mislabeled a lot of words like work, work and play and what those things mean. And I feel
*  like a lot of things that we consider work, aren't work at all. They're busy work. They're like a
*  waste of time. They're just you spending time in a place for a set number of hours. Whereas what I
*  consider real work is getting yourself better. Exercising, reading, meditating to me, that is
*  work. That is how you actually get better at things. And, and that's just kind of how I look
*  at it. This is my job. I work in entertainment. Even if I didn't work in entertainment, wouldn't
*  matter. But the fact that I do my main jobs are, stay ready, keep material going,
*  make sure I fucking look good and just have a positive attitude. And if I keep it that simple,
*  everything else is fine. Yeah. That work that, that making sure you do that work
*  for some people, it's just, it's an alien concept. They never really developed that habit. But if you
*  do, if you just, I swear to God, anybody listen to this, like, Oh, I don't think I could do that. If
*  you just started just left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, just do it, please just get going.
*  Just get going. Once you get going, so easy to keep going. It becomes momentum. So much harder
*  to start from a stand still position. But once you're doing it and you kind of like, Hey, I
*  worked out every day this week. Hey, I worked out every day this month or Hey, I worked out
*  four days a week for the past six weeks. Like fuck man, you got some momentum now. Yeah. And
*  just feels good. And especially, you know, when I was three sixties, not like I was going around
*  doing box jumps and tire pushes and all that shit. I was walking. I was walking and walking and
*  walking and doing some light bicep curls or whatever, you know, it, you, it doesn't matter
*  where you start. Did you go all in right from the jump when you said, all right, I'm going to lose
*  weight or did you vacillate? Did you? No, once I, you know, again, my MOLA decision and I make it.
*  So once the decision was made, it was more like, okay, it's out of my hands. I would do what my
*  trainer says and that's it. And that's been the craziest thing because he'll then like recently
*  he'll talk about other clients and he'll be like, well, you know, you wanted him to do this. He
*  didn't want to do it. So he didn't do it. And I go, Oh, I, I never comprehended that I could tell,
*  you know, you know, like I never even thought that I could be like, yeah, I know I'm tired.
*  Fuck it. You know, I thought, Oh, I'm paying you. This is your job. So I just listened to you,
*  you know, and, but I think, you know, so in that way, it's just me having a good attitude about it.
*  Once I was in it, I was in it. And then later came the thing of like, Oh, I have to mentally now
*  undo like the fact that I still want these things. You know, I, it was easier to just be, okay,
*  why not doing it? Cause I need to protect my health and I'm going to die. But once I got down to a
*  healthy way, it was like, okay, now we have to deal with the mental aspect. I went to like
*  overeaters anonymous for a couple of classes and I didn't like that. What is that like?
*  It's like Alcoholics Anonymous. Basically it's the same book even that they read from. Yeah.
*  So I think they just need to get their shit changed and get their shit together because
*  it doesn't match up because they read you these like things like, Oh,
*  reach my lowest moment. I lost my family. I was living in a train and I was like, well, no,
*  I can't relate to that. My lowest moment is that I, you know, took a bite of a donut and then put it
*  on top of the trash and then came back and got it and then had to put it deeper in the trash.
*  That's what I need to work on. Yeah. It's a different kind of addiction, right? Yeah.
*  Though you don't really lose your life the same way, you know, you know, it's slow. You lose your
*  life in a weird way. You lose your physical life. Yeah. You start telling, I just remember
*  mentally the change of being like, well, you know, I just don't want to do that. I don't want to,
*  I can't physically go scuba diving. They won't let me at my waist. So, you know, I'm just not
*  interested in any of that, you know? And now it's like, I wouldn't do anything. I went to,
*  you know, I went to pro wrestling school for a few months. Did you really? Yeah. Think about
*  going to Jamar neighbors has me going to clown college idea. So I'm up to anything. Clown college
*  thinking about it. What is that? Talk to me. I don't know much about it, but he went, he went,
*  Jamar neighbors, Jamar so crazy. Yeah. And so I was talking to him about acting class and he was
*  like, man, I think you would kill it at clown school. What the fuck is clown school? Like,
*  what do you do? I bet you there's a lot of water bits, some prop work, a lot of nose honking. Yeah.
*  But I bet you there's some tumbling stuff too. And so I'd be interested in that. But yeah,
*  what's so wrestling school? Tell me about pro wrestling school. Like what was this because
*  you want to go full David Arquette. Great reference. Never go full David Arquette.
*  Can't kill David Arquette documentary. Yeah, I know about it. I just watched a trailer for it. I'm
*  like, this motherfucker is killing himself. Yeah. He's out there doing deaf matches, getting hit in
*  the head with like light bulbs and shit. Like, okay. Yeah. Insane. No, I didn't want to do that.
*  I just, you know, been a big fan of two things my whole life, comedy and pro wrestling. And
*  I decided I wanted to, when I lost a weight, I was not aware of what my body was capable of anymore.
*  You know, I would still be like pushing myself up off of things and my trainer would be like,
*  what the fuck? Like, you know, you're much lighter than you think you are. Oh, that's funny. And so
*  I decided to go. Old habits. Yeah, old habits. So I decided to go to school to be like, okay,
*  let me throw my body around. Let me do as many fucking squats as I can. Let me see what I can do.
*  Oh, did they make you do like the body weight squats? Oh, yeah. Like Carl gotch type workout.
*  Yeah. One day they were just mad at us. So they made us do like 375 squats. Oh, that's a fun day.
*  The next day, huh? It was a fucking bathtub day. That's what.
*  An Epsom's day. Oh, so much salt. Oh my God. Bodyweight squats will fuck you up. Anybody
*  tells me they need a gym to work out. I'm like, listen to me. Show me that you could do 200
*  bodyweight squats. You don't need a gym to work out. You could develop amazing leg muscles,
*  just bodyweight squatting. Yeah. I mean, squats, sit-ups, push-ups, burpees. That's a fucking,
*  that's a workout. Fuck yeah, it is. You ever do those Hindu squats where you lift your heel up
*  at the bottom and then push up? No. Tremendous for the quads. Yeah. Hindu squats are interesting.
*  You start off like this, right? And then you drop down. You put your hands behind you as you drop
*  down. And as you drop down, your heels go up and then you push up and come back up to here and then
*  do it again. Oh, so it's like a sweep. Yeah. Sort of. Yeah. But it's, the thing about it is,
*  here, I'll do one real quick. The thing about it is as you're going down, when you go down,
*  your heels come up. Like down here, my heels are up. Yeah. And you're up like this. So it's like,
*  it really works the top of your quads, like your quads where it touches the knee. Tremendous,
*  amazing exercise. And it's just bodyweight. Yeah. I was, yeah, especially when I was on the road and
*  couldn't find a gym. I would squats all the time. Yeah. But Hindu squats, Hindu push-ups, regular
*  push-ups and a chin-up bar. You're good. You're good. You don't need anything. But if you can get
*  other shit in there too, they got you kettlebells. You do shit like that. I need to get some kettlebells.
*  I don't currently. I mean, I was going to the gym a lot, you know, so I had everything there.
*  At home, I just kind of have up to 50 pound dumbbells. I need to get, I've been trying to
*  buy bigger dumbbells, but the fuck, they're so expensive right now. I tried to buy some 65 pounds.
*  They want to charge me $700. 700 bucks. $700 for a pair. That's crazy. Yeah.
*  Is that real? Yeah. Is that just because everybody bought them out? I think it's all
*  quarantined up and then shipping and the weight of the shipping and all that shit. I don't know.
*  700 bucks for a pair of dumbbells is hilarious. Yeah. So I'm on, you know,
*  you got to go prison style bro. Just get some rock sticks on them. But I need to get some
*  bigger weights for sure. Trying to get jacked? Yeah, man. I'm trying to get as, as healthy and
*  put together as I can to like 40, 41, 42 and then you can cruise it. Yeah. Just cruise it from there.
*  Cruise it. Still maintain. I just turned 53. Okay. Well, yeah, see. Yesterday. Yeah, I know.
*  Happy birthday. Thank you. I thought about buying you something, but then I remembered.
*  Then I recalled. What could I get him? A hug is sufficient. I don't need anything.
*  Man, for real though. Happy birthday. You're fucking. I think I, you know, I texted you the
*  day I found out that about the things just about just your, your level ownership of your own shit,
*  the longevity, the how many, cause I go back and I look at my podcast, we just two years deep
*  and I'm like, Oh man, we've made it so far, but I could still do so much. And then I go back and I'm
*  watching old episodes of you. And it's like episode five 65, you know? And I'm just like, man,
*  there's a longevity. There's just, just as part of like, this is what I do.
*  This is my shit. And I don't, and I told you directly, the fact that you own that shit and
*  it's yours and you licensed them was, is a huge inspiration to me. So I just wanted to make sure
*  I tell you that. Thank you brother. And like I said before, I really love what you do. I love
*  the energy that you put out. I really do because your energies are consistently positive and
*  friendly. Like I love that you do that and you put that out and you like, you say hi to people. I
*  hope you're doing great. And I know it's sincere, you know, and you have a big smile. And it's like,
*  that's, that's giant for people, man, to have a place like that where they could tune in and get
*  just consistent, positive vibes. Cause it's great. It's all, I mean, you know, shit gets weird, but
*  life's great for me. It's been so much better. My life is gravy compared to my childhood and
*  things I went through, you know, single mom and she had abusive relationship and all this other
*  shit and just never had structure or knowing, you know, a lot of things were up in the air in my
*  household. And now that I do what I literally do, what I want to do for my life. I know my passions.
*  Sure. I don't get everything I want, but it's like, man, I can never, and I get to work with my
*  fucking heroes, you know? And I never lose sight of that. And when Wanda Sykes is like, oh, you're
*  fucking, why aren't you in theaters yet? You're fucking good in theaters. And I'm like, you know,
*  I'm still a fan first. And so it's easy for me to be happy for people because I'm like, fuck,
*  this is dope. And success to me just begets other success. I don't look at and go, oh, I couldn't
*  get that. I go, oh, something's coming for me too. Yes. Yes. It's just about maintaining that
*  positive mentality. And that is really putting out positive vibes. Like what you're doing really does
*  change people's lives. It really does. You know, I mean, maybe you don't feel it yet, but I guarantee
*  you there's a lot of people that look to you for that positive inspiration. They look to you for
*  just happiness. And they're just like, you give that, you give that to people, man. And then they
*  get it. It's like a little seed you give them and it grows inside of their body. I just got an email
*  from this guy I'm doing this thing with, and I didn't, I didn't know too much about him. I know
*  he was referred to me by this other guy. We're doing this project together. And then he sends
*  me this email. Basically after we're done with this thing, Hey, man, I just want to let you know,
*  like, I didn't tell you this before, but because of you and listening to your podcast,
*  I used to have this terrible job. I quit my job. I moved to this new place. I started from scratch.
*  I started doing jujitsu. I lost weight. I got a way better job. Now I have a family, a marriage,
*  I have a kid. I'm a different person. And it's because of listening to your podcast and realizing
*  that you, you can change your life and you can do the things you want to do. You just got to push
*  yourself and you just got, and feeding off the energy of hearing someone say that that's actually
*  done it and recognize like, there's no difference between you and me. There's no difference between
*  me and the next guy is just I've done it and you can too. That's what people need to hear. You see
*  someone like Kevin Hart and you go, that guy's an alien. Like I just, I'm not like that. I can't do
*  it, but you're not, that's not true. He's just a dude. He's just a dude who's positive, who works
*  hard. And if you do that too, you will get successful. You will, you will find your fucking groove.
*  People who haven't done stuff are the people who tell you, you can't do it, you know, because that's
*  the reality that they've lived in. I've never met someone who's truly been successful who turns
*  around and goes, well, no, but you couldn't do it, you know, because they know, they know it's
*  fucking, it's just putting in the work and then it just, it might take decades, you know, I was
*  23, I was showing again on Twitch, showing these old videos of mine. I showed my special and then
*  I had somehow found this set of mine from when I was three years in. And so I showed it, we showed
*  him, we were making fun of it. I said, look at me, look how I'm dressed. Look, you can tell like,
*  these are my only good pants and they aren't good.
*  But man, if you didn't have that, you wouldn't appreciate where you're at now. That's so
*  important. Like that's, that's, there's a message for people that are struggling right now. Like
*  this struggle, fucking enjoy it, suck it in, take it in. First of all, it's fuel because it's going
*  to inspire you to move forward and become more successful. But also like, man, you're going to
*  look back on these days. The suck that you're experiencing right now will be delicious in five,
*  10 years. You're going to look back on it. It's going to be amazing. You're going to enjoy it.
*  Yeah, no, I get text messages. I got a text message the other day from my ex-wife's sister,
*  just being like, oh, I'm so proud of you. Look at you and you're in movies and this and that.
*  And you're amazing. And you're doing so well for your, your, your, your son, my, my nephew.
*  And then I was just like, this is so cool. Coming from the lady that used to call me the N word.
*  That's amazing. Do you still talk to the ex? No, not really. Sometimes just, you know,
*  keep her up to date to what's going on with her son, make sure that their relationship is still
*  strong. But me and her, no, you know, she just, she, I understand if I was in her position, I wouldn't
*  like how everything turned out. She ain't never been the niece.
*  I don't know what that's like. Yeah. As much as you like to see some people succeed,
*  there's a, there's a certain amount of satisfaction in knowing that you
*  bypassed all the pitfalls that other people falling into. Yeah. Especially if you had some
*  non non-fun relationship issues with them. Yeah, it truly is. I still try to, it's my,
*  you know, my son's mom. So I always have a love for her and I want her to be successful
*  and I want her to be happy. But I'm very, I know I want.
*  It's awful.
*  It's awful to take happiness and other people's failures like that. But yeah,
*  but that was their choices. And yeah, it's like, also like you can learn a lot from other people's
*  failure. As much as you can get out of people's success, man, look at someone who, you know,
*  that's just sabotaging their life left and right. And you can learn from that too. The thing, one of
*  the things that you were talking about that I think is so important is that taking ownership of
*  your fuck ups, taking ownership of the things you did wrong and trying to rectify that, trying to
*  just, you know, you don't want to repeat those patterns, recognize them, you know.
*  Develop development, getting better evolve. I think that's the thing, you know, through,
*  especially social media lately that we don't, we don't allow people to evolve. We don't allow them
*  to change. We hold them to the same statement that they made 10, 15, 20 years ago. And if someone's
*  an asshole today, that's fine. I understand that. It's okay to not fuck with people, but like
*  to judge someone over things they did 10, 15, 20 years ago, obviously case by case spaces, but
*  you're denying the existence of evolution. You're denying that people change and that people can get
*  better. And I just always believe in that because I've seen it in myself. I've seen it in my friends
*  and the people around me. There's so many people that if they truly, some people don't want to
*  change and they don't ever, they never will. But I met a lot of people who, who weren't the best
*  people and they pulled their shit together because they had to. Yeah, I agree. I agree wholeheartedly.
*  And I know I've grown and become a better person too. And through all that hard work and I almost
*  don't fault people that feel that way because it's, it's fucking hard today, man, you know,
*  and it's less hard for us because we had this advantage that we were kind of, we were moving,
*  you know, we already had momentum when this shit hit and we were in a business where, you know,
*  we're very fortunate that when you do well and show business, you can make a decent amount of
*  money. You could save some of it and you can put it aside, but there's so many people out there
*  that have no hope. And I understand the bitterness and the anger. I understand it all. I get it. I
*  mean, this is a fucked up time. It's a fucked up time where like half the country can't work.
*  And when you have that, you're going to have just a dystopian perspective on everything. And that's
*  what you have with people today. And I just want us to come out of it. I really do. And when we come
*  out of it, man, I hope we look back and just appreciate where we are. If we get to a point
*  where we can all gather and go to comedy clubs and go to restaurants and movie theaters and normal
*  shit like we used to do sporting events, you can go see pro wrestling live, all that shit, man. I
*  just hope we really enjoy it. And maybe we will. Maybe it will be better because we'll recognize
*  like, hey man, this can all go away. Now we know it can all go away. Yeah, just learning to
*  respect the audience more. Clearly, nothing without an audience. I'm nothing. And sometimes I didn't
*  always go into every show being like, I need to give these people, you know, I'm sure you know.
*  And so I'm just trying to be more aware of that. And any chance I've had, although it was great,
*  like I was like, okay, I did this one show where they there's a little stage and a screen and
*  people can see you. And I was like, oh, it felt so good to get on stage again. And I want to be
*  grateful for it. And they asked me to come back. And then I slept through it. And I was mad at
*  myself at first. But then I was like, no, this is like getting back to normal. Yeah, that's funny.
*  I did some stand up. I did a weekend, the Houston improv, but I was like, man, I can't catch COVID.
*  I got to get out of here. I did, you know, one weekend and I did all the right things,
*  kept the fuck away from people, wore a mask, did my shows, got off, get out of there. I didn't take
*  pictures, didn't hug anybody. But I was still like, but what if I got it? And what if I give it to
*  someone I love? Yeah. Yes. I got really high the next day and I got real paranoid. I was like,
*  what if I have it? What if I have it and I'm going to give it to people? Yeah. And then I was like,
*  I can't do this. Yeah. I went through the same mindset because I had a couple of gigs on the
*  docket still. But I went through that same thing. Like, oh, I want to do stand up so bad. I want to
*  perform. I want to fill that filling of people applauding when I enter a room. But I just fucking
*  have that same paranoia. Like, oh, what if I give it to someone and, you know, I'm healthy and that's
*  fine. But I give it to someone and they give it to their grandma and their grandma dies because
*  they went to hear me do some dumb bullshit jokes. I can't. I don't want that. Exactly. Exactly. But
*  at a certain point in time, like, what do we do if this is normal forever? Like, what if COVID doesn't
*  go away and this is just the deal? This is just how things are. Then what do we do? Do we decide
*  then? Well, fuck it. Let's just have comedy clubs. People are going to get it. They're just going to
*  get it. There is no cure. There's nothing you could do. Do we just live like this? I don't think so.
*  That doesn't sound good. That doesn't sound good. So the question is always like, are we living like
*  this because we're waiting for them to develop enough hospital beds and waiting for them to
*  develop some sort of a treatment that's responsible that really does work well? Is that what's going on?
*  Because if we, I mean, we're all hoping for a vaccine, but if there's nothing, if it doesn't
*  happen, let's just imagine it doesn't. What do you do? At some point in time, we're going to have to
*  say, fuck it. We're going to have to get back to work and get back to life. Yeah. That'll be a weird
*  life. I don't want that. And then I hadn't thought about that until you brought it up. Damn. But now
*  I am thinking about it and it's like a horror movie. Well, here's the thing, man. There's more
*  than one version of this disease right now. More than one. There's a one in India that's so different
*  from the one here that if they develop a vaccine for the one that's in North America, it won't work
*  for the one that's in India. And this is, it's possible that this thing is going to morph like
*  the common cold or like a lot of other viruses and spread all over the place. Well, if they don't have
*  a disease prevention, if there's no way other than keeping your body healthy, keeping your immune
*  system strong, we're not going to live like this, man. We can't just live like this forever. We're
*  living like this temporarily. This is the idea. So we have to like, that is a possibility that we
*  need to take into account. It's interesting. It means life's going to be different. It means a
*  lot of people are going to die. A lot of people are wearing masks. A lot of people with fucked up teeth
*  that are going to be real happy. I'm okay with the mask thing because that's been, I mean, I got used
*  to that from Japan from when I went to Japan for two weeks. I was like, oh, that's fine. Oh, when you
*  went to Japan for two weeks, was it COVID or no COVID? Pre-COVID. But a lot of people just wear
*  masks. When if they're feeling a little ill, you wear a mask. Well, that's a polite thing over there,
*  right? Yeah. Well, that's why they did an amazing job. They got to a point where like, I think the
*  entire country only had a thousand deaths, which is amazing. But especially if you, because people
*  consider the size of Japan that it's not like super populated. But if you consider that most
*  of the population in Japan is in just very dense areas, like Tokyo is everyone right on top of each
*  other. And they never locked down. They kept working the entire time. They just wore masks
*  and they only had a thousand deaths. It's pretty amazing. I have a buddy of mine who's a political
*  commentator and he was like, you need to look at this. Sent me this article explaining all the
*  things Japan did. They did just basically, they follow order. They're polite. If you go over there,
*  I've only been to Tokyo once, but it's like amazing how different their culture is, like how polite
*  they are and how they avoid, you know, like on the streets, like everybody, there's no garbage
*  everywhere. Nobody picks up their shit. You don't even, it's rude to walk around and eat. Yeah.
*  You're supposed to go take it to the proper place, get rid of your trash and then go about your day.
*  It's crazy. Yeah, they have, they just have patterns of behavior and patterns of like,
*  they're just what they accept or what they expect rather from society, from people and they all
*  agree. Yeah, truly. Discipline. Yeah. If you haven't gone and we ever get the chance to travel,
*  go. It's fucking amazing. I can't wait to go to other countries again. I want to go to some weird
*  places. I can't wait. Once the shit is, if the shit ever lifts up, I got, I just want to go,
*  I want to take in as many weird cultures. I want to go to Bali. I want to see what that's like. I
*  want to go to Indonesia. I want to go to a lot of the Pacific islands. I want to go to the Philippines.
*  I want to go to a lot of places I've never been that I've just seen in videos. I'm just like,
*  and I want to go to Egypt. That's, that's the thing I've been kicking myself in the head about,
*  like, why didn't I go see the pyramids? I do, I need to go see that. I'd like to do that.
*  Every person that I'm friends with, Schultz went, he went right before COVID.
*  Everybody that I'm friends with that went there, they're like, bro, they're like, this shit changed
*  my life. Like it's so big and so crazy. Like, what the fuck is this? Who built this? How did this
*  happen? What was this culture like? And the fact that you got fucked up Cairo right there next to
*  this ancient civilization that's so far more sophisticated in their structures.
*  Like that's one of them things where I think perspective shifting places are very important
*  to go to just because it just gives you, we're so used to like Los Angeles or Boston or wherever
*  you're from, you're used to these cities and this is, this is how people live. And then you go to
*  Chichen Itza and you go, oh shit, like, whoa, the Mayans doing, you know, these motherfuckers are
*  doing this shit 1500 years ago. Like, what is this? How are they doing this? Why were they doing
*  this? What was life like back then? You realize like the pattern that we're in is just the pattern
*  that we're in. It doesn't mean this is the only pattern that human beings follow. Just like,
*  just like you were talking about Japan. That's a different pattern. They're on a different pattern.
*  Their pattern, they got into this really disciplined pattern, being polite, wearing a mask.
*  Our pattern is fucking chaos, but more, but also our pattern is more creative. That's a weird thing
*  about our pattern over here in America. We do a lot of wild shit, but man, we create a lot of good
*  shit. You know, if you think about all the movies and the art and the comedy and the music, all the
*  shit that comes from this one continent. Yeah. I mean, it can only come from a lack of structure
*  and from chaos and things going on. That's why we have so many forms of art that are created here.
*  That's why jazz is created here. That's why hip hop is created here. Stand up comedy invented here.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It is. It's like, that is what's interesting, right? It's like, you gotta kind
*  of have both of those things. You gotta kind of have chaos, but you also kind of gotta have some
*  discipline too. That's why I think that's one of the reasons why America has done so terrible with
*  this, this COVID reaction. We were the worst at it. All the fucking big countries, we are the worst.
*  It's crazy when you really look at it. The rest of the world is just like,
*  we don't want Americans right now because you're in an underdeveloped nation, medically.
*  You're fucking idiots. You guys don't listen. You want to have like a big protest where you don't
*  wear masks. Like we want to fucking freedom. And then just thousands of people march down the street
*  saying, we don't want to wear masks. Bill Gates, the devil, fuck Fauci. Like the people are crazy.
*  You're wild people, but they come up with some good shit. Such a conundrum.
*  Take part of me. I love America. I look, I'm some fucking American flag behind me.
*  It's a reason for that. I love America genuinely. I love the concept. I love the concept of,
*  I, you know, I'm the grandchild of immigrants. My family all came over here from Europe. I love
*  the fact that these people were, we're like the ancestors of these people that decided wherever
*  they were, they just didn't want to be there anymore. You know, and they, they, no, not me.
*  Or, or realize, uh, Hey,
*  you know, that's, that, that is for sure the most fucked up part of America. Right? It is
*  the most fucked up for sure how it was started. Slave owners that wanted to be free.
*  But it's also, um, there's a beauty that people don't see. I think that a lot of, there's a lot of like,
*  in everyday white people that I talk to, there's a little bit of fear of this, just like this black
*  anger of people being like, not only black lives matter that we want, you know, reparations, we want
*  everything back. We want, um, you know, which will also be great. That'd be fun. But to me,
*  what's so beautiful about America is this level of forgiveness that's built into our, our
*  structure to the fact that we can have that history, that, you know, horrible history. And then
*  there's no other country that freed those people. And then they live there right next to their
*  oppressors, you know, and then, and there's forgiveness and there's balance and there's like,
*  Oh, well, we just want to continue to be a part of this lifestyle. And we want to succeed and have
*  our own freedoms like you. We're not trying to be like, you know, we're not trying to be like,
*  we're not trying to then take over and now white people are slaves. It's just beautiful thing that
*  there's this like forgiveness there. And that they want to see the table. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And also
*  the amount of creativity that comes from that culture and just stop and think of that, right?
*  Like through pressure, diamonds are created and just look at the black American community and
*  think about all the different forms of art that not just originated with black Americans, but were
*  mastered by them to a point where like, like even rock and roll, like Jimi Hendrix is the greatest
*  guitar player of all time. I mean, you go and look at standup comedians. I mean, there's, there's so
*  many musicians, so many, so many artists. So, so, I mean, that's the crazy thing about art, right?
*  Like so much of art is this dynamic expression that comes from pain. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's
*  to me the beauty and the alchemy in art is to take your traumas, take your pain, and then to turn
*  those things into your successes and your, and the reason why you have finances. Yeah. It's amazing.
*  Yeah. And I'm hoping that through the, I mean, this obviously racial relations are in this really
*  strange upheaval right now. They're in a bad spot. They're in a bad spot, but they're also in a spot
*  where there's a potential for growth. You know, like when you see these Black Lives Matter protests,
*  what the, the thing that gives everybody hope is that people are together walking down the street
*  in unity and that they recognize that this is, this is a unique moment to make things better.
*  This is a unique moment to take a stand, to talk about things, to recognize that there's problems,
*  and out of the brutal murder of one man, this eruption that has existed all throughout,
*  not just North America, but it's spread throughout the globe. It's a crazy time and through crazy
*  times, oftentimes on the other end of it, you get a better world. Truly, truly. Yeah. I look, I choose
*  to look at those positives because police brutality is not a new subject. You know, oppression is not
*  a new subject by any means, but the reaction to it, the, the, the amount of allies, the amount of
*  times where I see, I get so excited when I see all these young white allies, these people, these
*  millennials are, you know, that people kind of make fun of and they're the ones in the fucking
*  streets. The first, they're, they're first going to be like, no, this is bullshit. We don't, we
*  don't do this anymore. And I love that. To me, that's tremendous progress because I'm, you know,
*  there was a million man march years ago, years ago, when I was a child, there was marches about this
*  type of things. And before I was a child, you know, that's the thing I talk about. Yeah. My mom was
*  out on those marches getting bit by dogs and sprayed by fire hoses. And now we've reached the
*  point where I sit at home playing video games and I send my white assistant out to protest for me.
*  That's true progress. You sent your assistant out to protest? I did. I can show you a picture.
*  Did you test him after he came back? Hey man, before you come back to my house, I'm gonna have
*  to swab your nose. I trust her. She's pretty safe. It's hard to be safe. It is, but she's
*  fucking, yeah, she's pretty really particular. Thank you Eleanor for being so safe. That she did
*  that. She did. She protested for you. Hard to put it on airplane. I don't find it. No worries. No worries.
*  All right, man. Let's, let's wrap this up and tell everybody where they can get your podcast,
*  social media, all that shit. I got a lot of things going on. My podcast is called Getting
*  Better with Ron Funches. You can find that wherever you find your podcast. Even the name,
*  Getting Better. I love it. Yeah, it's not about becoming the best. It's not about, we are the
*  best. It's the fact that every single fucking day we're trying to get better and sometimes we fall
*  back, but we usually try to move forward. And that's what it's about. Great guest. Conan's been on
