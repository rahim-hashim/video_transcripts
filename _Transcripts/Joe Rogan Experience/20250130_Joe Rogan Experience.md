# Joe Rogan Experience #2265 - Kurt Metzger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6.0s)]
*  Meet the Cosby Kids [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=10.0s)]
*  Okay. Meet the Cosby Kids. Oh my god, look at this. The thing says meet the Cosby Kids. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=14.0s)]
*  Who wrote this sketch? I don't know. But what's funny is that back then that was ridiculous. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=24.0s)]
*  Yes, hey, I mean Phil Hartman's gone but all the rest of yous, thanks for speaking up. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=32.0s)]
*  Hey, this reminds me of the sketch that we did. Right. How come I just heard of this now? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=36.0s)]
*  How come I just heard of this now? Boy, SNL was funny. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=44.0s)]
*  Oh, SNL was great when Phil Hartman was on it. The early days of SNL were amazing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=46.0s)]
*  Yo, was Al Franken working there when they did that? I don't know. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=52.0s)]
*  Because I would think Senator Franken would have said something. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=54.0s)]
*  Oh, he's not a senator anymore. He got caught hugging a girl. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would think after you got screwed over like that you wouldn't still do Blue Maga, but I guess you would. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=60.0s)]
*  Ah, he's just locked in. That guy's great too. Al Franken's a great guy. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=64.0s)]
*  Yo, he had a funny, what time is it on Conan? It just made me laugh so hard. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=71.0s)]
*  He was saying how great it is for kids. My son, my kids just did a third grade report on bestiality. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=75.0s)]
*  And the other kids just loved it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=85.0s)]
*  How crazy is it though that that was a preposterous sketch? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=94.0s)]
*  Well, you know, John Money, I'm sure whoever wrote that knew about John Money, right? The guy that came up with that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=98.0s)]
*  I bet they didn't. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=103.0s)]
*  It's just a bunch of our lampoon Harvard people, right? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=105.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=108.0s)]
*  So, you know, they go, oh, the Simpsons, how do they predict the future? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=109.0s)]
*  You're near the people that pull the levers of power in college. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=111.0s)]
*  Like, you're just going to osmosis up their fucking plans. It ain't psychic. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=115.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they don't like broadcast their plans to students, undergrad students. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do. What do you think a Rhodes Scholar is? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=124.0s)]
*  That's them broadcasting their plans. That's what the great Bill Clinton, I believe you had a Meany Fly contact. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=127.0s)]
*  What do you mean by broadcast their plans? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=132.0s)]
*  The plans have never been seen. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=137.0s)]
*  You know, like, the plans were never in the 90s or the 80s. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=140.0s)]
*  The plans were never turned boys into girls. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=144.0s)]
*  Well, this was not in your department. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=147.0s)]
*  But I mean, you know how far back they should go? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=149.0s)]
*  You know, you know, in Rome, the galleys of Kibli, you know what that is? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=151.0s)]
*  When they were losing a Hannibal and the priestess of Kibli, it's like C-Y-B-E-L-E. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=155.0s)]
*  It looks like Sibili, but it's Kibli. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=162.0s)]
*  And the myth behind it is insane. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=165.0s)]
*  Like the myth stories, this one God that was too horny that had both sets of organs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=168.0s)]
*  So they trick him. I love, I love like, they trick him with wine and he, they tie his dick to the ground. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=172.0s)]
*  Come on, this somebody went to the hospital and they got him a bottle of wine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=179.0s)]
*  He just takes his dick to the ground and he, come on, this somebody went to church on Sunday. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=182.0s)]
*  So he went to a church and learned this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=186.0s)]
*  Tie his dick to the ground like how they do a bull, like through the nose. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=188.0s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, exactly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=191.0s)]
*  And then he jumped up and it ripped his dick off. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=193.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=195.0s)]
*  And then, so he starts hanging out with his handsome nephew. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=196.0s)]
*  And his nephew is faking like he's a great hunter because this dickless uncle, he still has a pussy, the uncle. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=201.0s)]
*  But these gods sure sound like just LA people. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=209.0s)]
*  Why do all the gods just sound like LA people? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=213.0s)]
*  This is the Kibli? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=216.0s)]
*  Yeah, the eunuch priest. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=219.0s)]
*  So my favorite writing about it is like when they celebrate Kibli. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=221.0s)]
*  And then the legend or the myth has more of like this wedding gets sabotaged by the jealous ripped off dick guy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=226.0s)]
*  And the women cut off their own breasts and the men cut off their genitals. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=233.0s)]
*  And there's an early Christian, I can't remember who's writing about it, but he goes, he goes, they cut off their genitals and go about shrieking in the street. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=237.0s)]
*  They castrate themselves as a sign of devotion to the goddess. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=246.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't think nothing's new, you know, I think it's all the same shit repackaged in different ways. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=249.0s)]
*  So then, you know. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=254.0s)]
*  They wore saffron rose and clash symbols together as they walked down the streets. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=256.0s)]
*  So they're basically having like one of those women's protests. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=260.0s)]
*  Kibli was also known as Magna Mater or the Great Mother. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=264.0s)]
*  So the doctor, if you heard Phil Hartman, he goes, mommy says, you know, like, this is like a theme that goes through history. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, you know what Rome, what Nero did, right? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=276.0s)]
*  What Nero did to what took that boy when his wife died. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=278.0s)]
*  He found a slave that looked like his wife and chopped his dick off and turned him into his wife. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=282.0s)]
*  Remember when you had that guy, Thaddeus, whatever the postmodern guy? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=287.0s)]
*  I was just watching. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=291.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=292.0s)]
*  I just happened to just rewatch it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=293.0s)]
*  And he basically told you like nothing's anything. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=295.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=299.0s)]
*  Like that's why I think the simulation talk is all like I look at everything is what's the marketing here to me. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=300.0s)]
*  And a lot of it's like nothing means anything. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=306.0s)]
*  So, you know, like, what's the big deal with kids? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=308.0s)]
*  You could do stuff with right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=311.0s)]
*  It always gets to that eventually. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=313.0s)]
*  Well, most of those guys who say that don't have kids. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=314.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=317.0s)]
*  You absorb your two is like middle aged men. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=318.0s)]
*  By the way, I'm heavily invested in Hocktail Coin. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=321.0s)]
*  Let me tell that he's idiot. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=326.0s)]
*  We should talk about that because I want to know what is what what is going on with the Maga coin. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=327.0s)]
*  Here's the thing that we're talking about last night. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=335.0s)]
*  The Maga coin was worth thirty six billion dollars. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=339.0s)]
*  So here is not the Maga coin. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=340.0s)]
*  Just Trump. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=342.0s)]
*  OK. Trump coin. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=343.0s)]
*  So the Trump coin. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=344.0s)]
*  I'm calling it the Maga coin. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=345.0s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=346.0s)]
*  The Trump coins were thirty six billion dollars. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=347.0s)]
*  What that means is thirty six thousand people put a million dollars in. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=349.0s)]
*  That doesn't make sense. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=359.0s)]
*  So that's thirty six thousand million. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=361.0s)]
*  That's what thirty six billion is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=363.0s)]
*  I believe I'm not good at math. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=365.0s)]
*  Isn't that right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=367.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=368.0s)]
*  I know Hocktail sounds insane. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=369.0s)]
*  You could get thirty six thousand people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=372.0s)]
*  Let's say it's way more people, way less money. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=375.0s)]
*  They contribute. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=378.0s)]
*  It still seems insane if you're using real money. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=379.0s)]
*  You've been to a casino or something. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=382.0s)]
*  But that's the point. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=383.0s)]
*  We talked about. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=384.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=385.0s)]
*  You and I talked about this. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=386.0s)]
*  It is essentially gambling. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=387.0s)]
*  It's degenerate gamblers is how the people that make the coins talk about the people. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=388.0s)]
*  But the argument is that Trump is ripping off his fans with this Trump coin. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=391.0s)]
*  My question is how is he ripping off his fans? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=395.0s)]
*  It's basically like DraftKings. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=399.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=402.0s)]
*  So it's a casino. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=404.0s)]
*  And the thing is the reason people like you know Hocktail coin people know it's stupid. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=405.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=410.0s)]
*  But they the kind of what people say the scam was as I understand it is they thought they [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=411.0s)]
*  were getting in on the dump phase too. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=415.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=418.0s)]
*  So the trick is almost everybody getting in on it knows they're going to have to dump [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=419.0s)]
*  it and they think they're going to dump it first. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=422.0s)]
*  So they're not the pump is for other idiots. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=425.0s)]
*  I mean it's built in that another idiot is going to shoulder the whatever happens. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=427.0s)]
*  But what happens is every so often does my buddy is telling me it works in it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=432.0s)]
*  One of them does turn out to be real. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=436.0s)]
*  So something like a Trump like now I'm more of a Warren Buffett where I wish I had golden [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=437.0s)]

*  So here's the question. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=539.0s)]
*  What's the problem with having a coin? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=541.0s)]
*  Because there's a bunch of those coins and the thing is like it's unbefitting of a president. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=543.0s)]
*  I get that argument. That makes sense. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=547.0s)]
*  You know, he's you shouldn't do that. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=549.0s)]
*  You're you should be really concentrated and run the company. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=551.0s)]
*  You shouldn't have some obvious like money grab. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=553.0s)]
*  What about being completely senile? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=555.0s)]
*  Is that unbecoming? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=557.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it should have been. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=559.0s)]
*  Shut up about unbecoming from now on. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=561.0s)]
*  The chart for Trump coin right now, but a lot of that comes from issues like the top 10 holders of the coin. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=563.0s)]
*  The number one would be the wallet who started it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=569.0s)]
*  OK, so that's that's his. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=571.0s)]
*  So he owns 80 percent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=573.0s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=575.0s)]
*  If they don't sell, if the person who owns the coin, say if you made a Metzger coin and the Metzger coin, I did, was worth 36 billion dollars. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=576.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=584.0s)]
*  You are so rich. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=585.0s)]
*  By the way, here's not only a five billion. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=587.0s)]
*  Oh, whoa. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=590.0s)]
*  I mean, it dropped from 36 to five. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=591.0s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=594.0s)]
*  It was when they were saying it was at 30 whatever the highest was the coin was worth 72 or 73 dollars a coin. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=595.0s)]
*  It's now down to twenty five, twenty six. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=601.0s)]
*  Should you sell? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=604.0s)]
*  How much do you have in it? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=605.0s)]
*  Depends on how much do you have in it? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=607.0s)]
*  I know you got to disclose stuff like he gets in on that stuff. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=609.0s)]
*  Well, if you can get in, catch the tweet early Friday night. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=612.0s)]

*  Lord, you think I don't have one. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=627.0s)]
*  When a man comes in wearing velour, you just hit a big on shit going to feeling good about myself. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=632.0s)]
*  I told you I think that's what Kamala was because they all knew she wouldn't win. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=639.0s)]
*  And they ran a great campaign. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=642.0s)]
*  They keep saying that hypnotic phrase is it well great in that they knew she wouldn't win. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=644.0s)]
*  They all didn't like her and they all cashed in. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=648.0s)]
*  They go. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=650.0s)]
*  They did cash in. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=651.0s)]
*  But a lot of those special interest groups cashed in. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=652.0s)]
*  She's a human hawk to a pump and dump. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=654.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=656.0s)]
*  Because what was the final tally for the amount of money they spent? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=657.0s)]
*  At first they were saying it was one billion dollars, but it's more. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=660.0s)]
*  I think now they've got it at one point five billion. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=663.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the Tim and Eric billion dollar movie. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=668.0s)]
*  And I bet Tim and Eric voted for her. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=671.0s)]
*  Smart. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=674.0s)]
*  It's important when you're in Hollywood to vote right. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=676.0s)]
*  You want to get ahead in your career, you have to vote right. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=679.0s)]
*  Well, if you really want to get ahead, you should do something dirty on tape with another scummy motherfucker that you can hold over each other. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=681.0s)]
*  You know, it's how our government works. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=688.0s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=690.0s)]
*  America's national bird should be gay blackmail. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=691.0s)]
*  OK, do you know what the eye in the pyramid is? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=697.0s)]
*  It's somebody peeping through a hole and watching you. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=699.0s)]
*  How Kamala Harris burned through one point five billion in 15 weeks. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=702.0s)]
*  So she's the hawk to of this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=707.0s)]
*  They're dumping it all on her, even though it's probably how how he Mandela's son in law. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=708.0s)]
*  They did it. She's pressed for more cash since the election, which is crazy. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=712.0s)]
*  She's asking for cash. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=716.0s)]
*  You know, my girl gets because my girl gets Democrat fundraiser things back when they they overturn Roe v. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=717.0s)]
*  Wade and and then the next day asked for money. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=723.0s)]
*  That's like the ultimate test of like how much of a cow you are. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=727.0s)]
*  Right. They said we need money because they just overturned. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=729.0s)]
*  They held Roe v. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=732.0s)]
*  Wade. How long they hold that over everybody's head that you're going to lose Roe v. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=733.0s)]
*  Wade if you don't. And I remember Trump being like, I didn't tell him to do that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=736.0s)]
*  I don't think he did. I think that's one of those gun rights. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=739.0s)]
*  And doing that are the two like how do we emotionally hit somebody to make them do what we want? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=743.0s)]
*  And since they do a shit job, the mafia that runs shit, they're running out of emotional buttons to push on. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=748.0s)]
*  Right. Plus, they got you pumped full of drugs and make you not feel things. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=754.0s)]
*  Right. So you got to jerk off to my little pony eventually. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=757.0s)]
*  Right. I'm sure there's no problem. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=759.0s)]
*  Do you remember Temple? You know Temple Grandin is right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=764.0s)]
*  No. The autistic lady that helped them cattle ranchers. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=768.0s)]
*  She's engineer. It was real Ted Talk circuit kind of person. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=771.0s)]
*  Oh, I kind of vaguely remember now. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=774.0s)]
*  Twenty years ago, my friend was there. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=777.0s)]
*  She realized because she could kind of think like a cow because they'd be spooked by shadows and stuff. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=778.0s)]
*  And so she understood stuff about them. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=783.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's interesting. It's very smart. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=785.0s)]
*  Right. Boy, what a useful citizen. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=790.0s)]
*  Think of these useful citizens we have now that they're really technically minded and really focus on that. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=792.0s)]
*  They can part. They self compartmentalize almost. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=798.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you could program whatever sexuality you like. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=801.0s)]
*  You're a woman like I am. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=803.0s)]
*  You can fucking make them fall in love with TV ponies and the more vaccines you get on, the more easy they are to program. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=805.0s)]
*  Oh, last time I was here. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=810.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=812.0s)]
*  The last time I was here, I mean, my girl flew. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=814.0s)]
*  And so I was asleep. I like to be knocked out. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=817.0s)]
*  I don't want to be awake for any part of the flight. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=819.0s)]
*  OK. And my girl sit next to this other girl who she thought was a kid at first was probably a 30 year old woman. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=821.0s)]
*  So she was like she must have been from Pacific Northwest, vaguely Asian, wearing a Pikachu mask, COVID mask. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=826.0s)]
*  OK. Bright colors. OK. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=834.0s)]
*  She sits down and I'm passing by. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=838.0s)]
*  I go looks and the and the girls get in the cookies they bring you and she has a box with a little Pikachu when she sits it on the tray and eats cookies like with it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=840.0s)]
*  OK. And then the judge like I fell asleep and she woke up laughing because the girls got an iPad. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=849.0s)]
*  She's laughing her ass off at Clifford, the big red dog. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=855.0s)]
*  OK. And it's like a 30 year old woman. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=859.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I go, just so you know, sweetie, that chick will make more money than you ever have in your life. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=861.0s)]
*  That's the new future. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=866.0s)]
*  So I when you told me I China thing that they were doing some weird intelligence raising experiment, what you tell me about? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=868.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, they did. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=874.0s)]
*  Well, they said that they were trying to take these babies and make them immune to HIV. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=875.0s)]
*  But what they were really doing was making their propensity for intelligence much higher. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=881.0s)]
*  So you think I see. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=886.0s)]
*  And then the guy got arrested for doing it and went to jail and got out. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=888.0s)]
*  But he was like this like what's obviously they wanted him to do it like the whole thing. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=891.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you got to compete or America is going to hand you your ass. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=894.0s)]
*  I'm sure they got the same story here. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=897.0s)]
*  Here. But they're trying is going to hand us our ass. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=898.0s)]
*  They're literally developing geniuses from the womb. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=900.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, so are we real weird geniuses. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=903.0s)]
*  But here's the question. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=906.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you do that if you found out that there was a thing that doctor mutilating the children? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=907.0s)]
*  No, these kids have been mutilated. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=912.0s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=914.0s)]
*  But if it's something just so simple as it just elevates your intellect, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=915.0s)]
*  If there's a gene expression that they can turn on or off and this thing that they can do when the child is in the womb can make the child 25 percent more intelligent. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=919.0s)]
*  Right. But they're going to be autistic. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=927.0s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=929.0s)]
*  Well, have you seen the telepathy tapes, which everyone tells me about? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=930.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's not those are nonverbal people like you turn the crank as so whatever you know, it's a great blend of chemicals. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=933.0s)]
*  But how do we know we don't know that these people are autistic? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=940.0s)]
*  They might just be just genius. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=942.0s)]
*  It might not have a side effect like there are people that are Chinese ones. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=943.0s)]
*  Chinese ones where they manipulate the genes. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=948.0s)]
*  The thing is like there's there. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=950.0s)]
*  Look, it's China. It's hard to tell. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=952.0s)]
*  There's a lot of geniuses that aren't like socially fucked up. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=953.0s)]
*  They're just really smart people. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=956.0s)]
*  So what what is that? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=957.0s)]
*  Like what is why does some people have a nine volt brain and other people have a fucking Tesla battery? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=959.0s)]
*  Well, that's the quest, is it? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=964.0s)]
*  That's why we have the Olympics. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=965.0s)]
*  That's why we have a eugenics festival every four years. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=966.0s)]
*  Right. But why wouldn't you why wouldn't you encourage that kind of manipulation in the world? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=968.0s)]
*  I guess because these people that play God invariably end up being perverts with like weird shaped dicks that they're taking it out on us like your Epstein's and such. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=972.0s)]
*  No, all these tech dudes, I want their dicks out. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=982.0s)]
*  I want to see what kind of deformities they have before I let them be in charge of shit. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=985.0s)]
*  You got a weird dick. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=988.0s)]
*  I don't think you should be social engineering. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=990.0s)]
*  Last night about a guy with a flute dick. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=992.0s)]
*  Oh, he could tell you this. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=994.0s)]
*  I don't want to say I don't want to name names because, you know, that's how Hitler happened. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=997.0s)]
*  Do you remember? Do you remember? I think her name was. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1001.0s)]
*  Is it Stacy Plaskett? Whoever it was. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1004.0s)]
*  Yeah. And she has this woman behind her that's like this super autistic lady that's mouthing every word. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1007.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's like, and I mean, I look, I shouldn't say she is. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1012.0s)]
*  I don't know if she is. Maybe she's just a very enthusiastic young lady that has like very bizarre behavior patterns. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1016.0s)]
*  I know exactly what it is because I talk to myself like a crazy person. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1022.0s)]
*  I have for my whole life. I'll just say just that look on that chick that looks like me if I'm not even alone. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1026.0s)]
*  I just am thinking about a thing. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1032.0s)]
*  But the fact with this girl's on, she wrote the speech. Right. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1034.0s)]
*  But she wrote it. Her eyes are wide. She looks like an alien. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1037.0s)]
*  She's mouthing the words of the play. Yes, yes, yes. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1039.0s)]
*  She's playwright and she's mouthing the words that she wrote. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1041.0s)]
*  She's a writer on a sitcom. Exactly. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1044.0s)]
*  And she's ready for the actors to deliver the lines. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1046.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's every bit as creepy as psychic puppetry. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1048.0s)]
*  That's the do you understand how creepy that is? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1051.0s)]
*  It's very weird. Yeah, because you know that lady who's the represent. Watch this. Look at her. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1053.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've made that face. Look at her eyes though. Look at those eyes. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1057.0s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1061.0s)]
*  Yeah, they went over it together. Look at her though. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1065.0s)]
*  See if Kamala had one of them, she could have done better. Look at those eyes. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1071.0s)]
*  Look at those eyes. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn't see that part. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah, she made a mistake and then the autistic girl corrects her. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1076.0s)]
*  Wait. I don't know if she's autistic. I shouldn't say that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1079.0s)]
*  She's saying that. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1083.0s)]

*  She mouthed her. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1095.0s)]
*  Because she said uh? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1097.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1099.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1101.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1111.0s)]
*  She realizes she made a mistake. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1116.0s)]
*  So she's going to correct her. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1118.0s)]
*  So she has to correct her. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1134.0s)]
*  So she leans over and says something to her. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1136.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1141.0s)]
*  Wait, that's not what I... [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1143.0s)]

*  Elmer FUD. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1295.0s)]

*  to Graham Hancock. Don't talk about that. It could [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1367.0s)]
*  lead to racism. Oh, this is Flint [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1369.0s)]

*  I bet it's worth a lot. What is [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1375.0s)]
*  the Dibble coin worth? But here's my question [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1377.0s)]
*  about the whole coin thing. Are they [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1379.0s)]
*  using real money? Is that $36 [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1381.0s)]
*  billion real money that they bought it for? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1383.0s)]
*  Or are they using fake money? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1385.0s)]
*  Are they using like [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1387.0s)]
*  Shibu Inu coin to [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1389.0s)]
*  buy Trump coin? But you [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1391.0s)]
*  know what I'm saying? So I was watching this thing [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1393.0s)]
*  on Shibu Inu coin when they were explaining that if [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1395.0s)]
*  you bought Shibu Inu coin in the beginning, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1397.0s)]
*  you know, like if you got a [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1399.0s)]
*  thousand dollars in Shibu Inu [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1401.0s)]
*  coin, at one point in time it was only worth [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1403.0s)]
*  $2, but now it's worth [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1405.0s)]
*  like $17 million. That's right. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1407.0s)]
*  Like if you hang on [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1409.0s)]
*  there in the waves, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1411.0s)]
*  like if Elon tweets about Shibu Inu [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1413.0s)]
*  coin, that fucking shit will skyrocket. And then [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1415.0s)]
*  you got... Right? I might have asked [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1417.0s)]
*  him to do that when he was here before and he didn't do it. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1419.0s)]
*  Look, here's the difference between... [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1421.0s)]
*  JD's trying to make the system. JD's trying to [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1423.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi the crypto market. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1425.0s)]
*  Guess what? Because I bet you know people got [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1427.0s)]
*  a story about how they had a whole bunch [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1429.0s)]
*  of Ethereum or Doge or whatever, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1431.0s)]
*  but then the place they bought the coin through [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1433.0s)]
*  was shady, and now [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1435.0s)]
*  they don't have shit. So here's the difference. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1437.0s)]
*  We get our real money the same way through dark [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1439.0s)]
*  occult magic, okay? But [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1441.0s)]
*  there's insurance on it, right? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1443.0s)]
*  You get some more money. That's why [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1445.0s)]
*  so to regulate it, some [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1447.0s)]
*  guy that did FTX creep, they want to be [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1449.0s)]
*  in charge of it. There's a time-tested [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1451.0s)]
*  oligarch way to do it. You go, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1453.0s)]
*  this is getting dangerous. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1455.0s)]
*  We have to regulate it, and then [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1457.0s)]
*  they control it, and then they're boss hog. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1459.0s)]
*  They need to be boss hog of the thing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1461.0s)]
*  So what you're seeing now is a mafia [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1463.0s)]
*  shift. The mafia of people [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1465.0s)]
*  that used to know what's his name, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1467.0s)]
*  he's at the McCarthy hearings, and he was [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1469.0s)]
*  pretending not to be gay and he had AIDS. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1471.0s)]
*  The famous guy... Jager Hoover? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1473.0s)]
*  The other one from the time that was friends with Trump [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1475.0s)]
*  and... [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1477.0s)]
*  He had AIDS? He died of AIDS. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1479.0s)]
*  It's a famous story. He prosecuted [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1481.0s)]
*  the people that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1483.0s)]
*  stole the nuclear bomb secrets. I'm blanking on his dumb name. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1485.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1487.0s)]
*  The gay blackmail guy. Him and [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1489.0s)]
*  Hoover worked it out. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1491.0s)]
*  No, no, that's the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1493.0s)]
*  mob boss that died of AIDS. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1495.0s)]
*  Trump's friend [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1497.0s)]
*  that notorious lawyer. Roy Cohn. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1499.0s)]
*  Roy Cohn. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1501.0s)]
*  I don't know who he is. You never heard of Roy Cohn? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1503.0s)]
*  I've heard the name, but I don't know who he is. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1505.0s)]
*  If you asked me, what does Roy Cohn do, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1507.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to tell you. My guess is Roy Cohn [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1509.0s)]
*  told Trump where all the bodies are buried. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1511.0s)]
*  I really got put on to this by [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1513.0s)]
*  dark journalists. I'm telling you, that guy's great. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1515.0s)]
*  Daniel List, his name is. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1517.0s)]
*  Just the facts. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1519.0s)]
*  He just gets the facts. Just the facts, ma'am. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1521.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so Roy Cohn, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1523.0s)]
*  the whole network that the whole [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1525.0s)]
*  pyramid scheme works on, which is blackmail, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1527.0s)]
*  Roy Cohn was part of that. And Trump, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1529.0s)]
*  you'll notice, doesn't drink, doesn't do drugs. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1531.0s)]
*  You know about who he slept with. Yeah, this guy. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1533.0s)]
*  So you know who Trump slept with already. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1535.0s)]
*  I don't care that he paid that chick to shut up. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1537.0s)]
*  Why would you even try to prosecute for that? I give a shit. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1539.0s)]
*  You know the shit all these other motherfuckers. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1541.0s)]
*  How creepy does he look? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1543.0s)]
*  Okay, he wasn't creepy, but. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1545.0s)]
*  He looks creepy. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1547.0s)]
*  So Trump is going in. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1549.0s)]
*  They wanted Trump to run, because then you'd have to vote Hillary. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1551.0s)]
*  You remember the story. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1553.0s)]
*  And then Trump won. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1555.0s)]
*  And it's like in Pulp Fiction, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1557.0s)]
*  when Bruce Willis wins, and he shouldn't have. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1559.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1561.0s)]
*  Because you can't have a guy that you don't have blackmail on. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1563.0s)]
*  The president, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1565.0s)]
*  the president doesn't have the highest security [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1567.0s)]
*  clearance, and he doesn't. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1569.0s)]
*  The president does not. He's supposed to, I thought. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1571.0s)]
*  But he doesn't. And the excuse is, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1573.0s)]
*  well, he's only there 48 years. Right? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1575.0s)]
*  So already now you've told me there's a deep state [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1577.0s)]
*  with that. Just with that. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1579.0s)]
*  And now you're telling me that the president has not meant [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1581.0s)]
*  anything for quite some time, because [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1583.0s)]
*  there's secrets we don't get to know [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1585.0s)]
*  or vote for, and that's just how it is. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1587.0s)]
*  And you saw men in black. Just trust them. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1589.0s)]
*  They got Will Smith on the team. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1591.0s)]
*  I don't like the way you're talking. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1593.0s)]
*  This is for the good of the company. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1595.0s)]
*  Excuse me, country. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1597.0s)]
*  The good of the country. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1599.0s)]
*  Even if you think it like original sin, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1601.0s)]
*  the whole concept of original sin, right? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1603.0s)]
*  That's incorporation. That's like the liability is on all of us. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1605.0s)]
*  For the company. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1607.0s)]
*  That's an incorporating [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1609.0s)]
*  thing. So everything's that. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1611.0s)]
*  Look, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1613.0s)]
*  everybody's going to keep putting [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1615.0s)]
*  money in these dumb coins, okay? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1617.0s)]
*  And I'll bet you a Trump coin, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1619.0s)]
*  which is bullshit. He's got some real [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1621.0s)]
*  crypto scumbags hanging around him. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1623.0s)]
*  Larry Ellison, I don't know who the hell is looking [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1625.0s)]
*  at that guy and thinking he should be [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1627.0s)]
*  in charge of anything. Peter Thiel, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1629.0s)]
*  I've never, I watch you talk to Peter Thiel. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1631.0s)]
*  I've never seen someone lie so artlessly [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1633.0s)]
*  and autistically in my life. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1635.0s)]
*  What'd he lie about? Oh, dude. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1637.0s)]
*  I'm going to put this out of Bedepstein Island. Maybe [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1639.0s)]
*  just some guys were cheating on their wives. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1641.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's all it was, Peter. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1643.0s)]
*  Some guys were cheating on their wives. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1645.0s)]
*  See, the thing is, he's a gay guy. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1647.0s)]
*  And he's not interested in going to that island. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1649.0s)]
*  So he's probably on the outs. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1651.0s)]
*  And allegedly, I mean, I don't know. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1653.0s)]
*  I don't know if he supposedly ever went. That's not the only game in town. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1655.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure there's gay blackmail. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1657.0s)]
*  But you can't gay, when a guy's [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1659.0s)]
*  single and gay, like what are you going to get on him? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1661.0s)]
*  That he fucks other guys? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1663.0s)]
*  See, that's why they didn't want gay marriage to be [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1665.0s)]
*  legal, because what are we going to blackmail with? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1667.0s)]
*  If you just be gay. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1669.0s)]
*  Oh, that's right. Worse things. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1671.0s)]
*  That's to make you do a lot worse stuff now that you can be gay. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1673.0s)]
*  Right. And why are there still people [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1675.0s)]
*  in the closet in this day and age when there's a goddamn [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1677.0s)]
*  rainbow flag on every corner? That's weird. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1679.0s)]
*  Well, it's people that got trapped. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1681.0s)]
*  Right? So they've been lying their whole life. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1683.0s)]
*  And the social stigma of it in [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1685.0s)]
*  the like the 80s and 90s. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1687.0s)]
*  Like, we know guys. Yeah, AKA the intel community. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1689.0s)]
*  You just described the intel community. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1691.0s)]

*  you know, like Russell Brands and DeGee's, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1767.0s)]

*  is perpetrator victim forever [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1773.0s)]
*  and that's the pyramid. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1775.0s)]
*  And I think that's the thing, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1777.0s)]
*  you know, I think that's the thing, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1779.0s)]
*  that's the thing, that's the thing, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1781.0s)]

*  that's the thing, that's the thing, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1789.0s)]
*  that's the thing, that's the thing, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1791.0s)]
*  that's the thing, that's the thing, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1793.0s)]

*  That's what I think is the thing. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1799.0s)]
*  So. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1801.0s)]
*  I want to use this, because I'm a [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1803.0s)]
*  perpetrator victim forever and that's the [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1805.0s)]
*  pyramid. And so you're going to have to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1806.0s)]
*  forgive people. I don't want to [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1808.0s)]
*  forgive none of them people at all. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1810.0s)]
*  So, I will take a miracle [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1812.0s)]
*  from Jesus to make me feel like that [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1814.0s)]
*  because they shouldn't be in control [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1816.0s)]
*  of the rest of the country's life. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1817.74s)]
*  Dude, when those files come out, the JFK ones, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1820.26s)]
*  because how much is gonna come out? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1822.2s)]
*  The reason they over classify, I think, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1825.34s)]
*  is you don't need that much threads to pull [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1827.58s)]
*  to pull it apart, and much smarter than people than me [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1830.5s)]
*  just do that all the time, and you can still find them. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1832.58s)]
*  And so when these new files come out, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1835.74s)]
*  and here's what I'll bet, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1837.66s)]
*  it'll be a lot of shit to go through, a lot. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1839.9s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1842.9s)]
*  I always think of that thing you told me [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1844.3s)]
*  about Judge Napolitano, about if you saw what I saw, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1845.76s)]
*  you wouldn't release it either? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1848.28s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, I think I know what that means, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1850.2s)]
*  but I don't, obviously. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1852.28s)]
*  What do you think it means? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1853.4s)]
*  Oh, I think it's Monarch, dude. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1854.64s)]
*  I think it's part of Monarch. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1856.2s)]
*  I hope it is. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1857.1200000000001s)]
*  I hope they're gonna get that off their chest, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1857.94s)]
*  that MKUltra never ended. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  I hope we're gonna get that off our chest, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1860.54s)]
*  because all UFO shit is directly with that, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1862.74s)]
*  and I don't know which parts are the mind control shit, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1866.6000000000001s)]
*  and which parts are some kind of entity. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1869.28s)]
*  So, and it's on purpose [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1871.8400000000001s)]
*  that you're not supposed to connect it, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1873.72s)]
*  but they're very connected. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1875.4s)]
*  Well, I told you my friend Evan Hafer's theory about JFK. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1877.46s)]
*  What is that? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1880.5400000000002s)]
*  That when, so here's what happened. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1881.38s)]
*  They don't clue JFK in on the Bay of Pigs [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1883.94s)]
*  until very late in the operation, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1887.74s)]
*  and air support is critical for the survivor, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1890.3000000000002s)]
*  the guys on the ground. Oh, Cubans, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1892.74s)]
*  So he pulled, not Cubans, Americans, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1894.26s)]
*  American special ops guys. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1896.3000000000002s)]
*  So they send in the fucking most ultra-violent, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1897.8400000000001s)]
*  best killers we have, but they have to have air support. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1900.74s)]
*  Well, he pulls, JFK pulls air support, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1903.92s)]
*  and those guys get fucked, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1906.72s)]
*  and a lot of guys died that shouldn't have died. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1908.2800000000002s)]
*  So those guys come back, and they're fucking furious. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1910.48s)]
*  And those are the type of people [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1913.4s)]
*  that you would hire to kill people, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1914.48s)]
*  because they kill people already. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1916.0400000000002s)]
*  So if you got those guys, and you've got this president [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  that the entire special forces division [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1920.44s)]
*  that went onto that island once dead, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1923.3200000000002s)]
*  so you have thousands, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1925.64s)]
*  or I don't know how many people deployed [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1926.96s)]
*  in that particular operation, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1928.64s)]
*  but you've got, let's say you got a thousand [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1930.0s)]
*  hardcore killers that want this president dead, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1932.62s)]
*  because their buddies got blown up unnecessarily. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1935.9399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Totally makes sense. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1938.54s)]
*  Yeah, I have a question, because they are killers. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1940.3s)]
*  How come they tried to kill Fidel Castro 600 fucking times, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1944.1399999999999s)]
*  which is kind of high, didn't get that done. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1948.02s)]
*  Only tried to kill Kennedy once, got that done. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1951.26s)]
*  Well, Kennedy was in a fucking convertible in Dallas, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1953.34s)]
*  and Fidel Castro was well aware [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1955.5s)]
*  that people were trying to kill him. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1958.26s)]
*  Right, it's easier to murder your own people [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1959.1s)]
*  who don't see it coming. That's true though. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1961.26s)]
*  But Castro was, he was having like affairs with women [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1962.9199999999998s)]
*  who knew things. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1967.48s)]
*  He was James Bond, that motherfucker. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1969.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was tied in to people that were involved [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1970.52s)]
*  in the potential assassination of him. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  He was getting inside information. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1976.36s)]
*  That's why he didn't smoke the exploding cigars. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1978.48s)]
*  They tried to do like a cartoon. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1980.6799999999998s)]
*  They gave him an exploding cigar. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1981.9199999999998s)]
*  This is just public record, which blows me away. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1983.1999999999998s)]
*  They're like 600, because he'll tell you what a monster he, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1985.5s)]
*  I'm sure he was. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1988.12s)]
*  I know if someone tried to kill me 600 times, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1989.1999999999998s)]
*  I might become a monster. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1991.58s)]
*  The first couple of times I might get different, you know? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1994.02s)]
*  But 600 times, I might get kind of cynical. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=1996.94s)]
*  I might lose my shine. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2000.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, he was already a monster. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2002.54s)]
*  I mean, he was already forcing the dictatorship [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2004.1799999999998s)]
*  on those people. Monsters are measurement, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2007.58s)]
*  and I want to know what you're measuring against. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2008.8s)]
*  I hope it's not against us, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2010.5s)]
*  because a lot of these guys come up smelling better [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2011.7s)]
*  when you measure them against America. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2014.36s)]
*  Did you notice that? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2015.86s)]
*  Such as George H.W. Bush, and George W., and Cheney, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2017.06s)]
*  and all those motherfuckers. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2020.66s)]
*  Look, hey, Gaza, what happened happened. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2023.64s)]
*  I guess we're gonna move on. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2026.0400000000002s)]

*  Go ahead, do the thing you're gonna do, and take our money. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2035.66s)]
*  You're entitled to it, to do the murders you did. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2037.8000000000002s)]
*  But don't come at me with that fucking- [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2040.76s)]
*  Moralism. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2042.76s)]
*  The morals of the West bullshit ever the fuck again, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2043.6000000000001s)]
*  because I'm gonna tell you to go fuck yourself. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2047.44s)]
*  That's all, because I didn't do this shit. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2049.28s)]
*  It is funny. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2052.0600000000004s)]
*  It is funny that George W., [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2053.02s)]
*  when he's sitting on the stage at the inauguration, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2055.0600000000004s)]
*  I look over at him, he's clearly medicated. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2056.98s)]
*  I would just guess. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2059.26s)]
*  He's a surhand, surhand, if there ever was one. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2060.42s)]
*  He's sitting there smiling, and look, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2062.98s)]
*  there's all these memes online, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2065.34s)]

*  deep down, how do we get people that aren't psychopaths [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2082.4s)]
*  to become secondary psychopaths, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2085.0400000000004s)]

*  Because we need people to do murder- [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2088.6400000000003s)]
*  Musgra. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2090.8s)]

*  Our whole public school system is based on [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2100.1200000000003s)]
*  how hard it is to get people to pull the trigger. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2102.4s)]
*  The Prussian system, right? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  That Prussian Emperor invented our schooling, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2105.92s)]

*  they tell you those rifles weren't accurate? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2109.46s)]
*  They were missing on purpose. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2111.3s)]
*  They didn't wanna kill people. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2112.46s)]
*  So what the hell? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2113.3s)]
*  Oh, they were growing up in loving families, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2114.12s)]
*  and we gotta fix that shit, right? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2116.34s)]
*  So here's the- [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2118.78s)]
*  So separate them earlier. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2119.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2121.34s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2134.66s)]

*  So I was with my family, this loving Italian family, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2148.06s)]
*  nice home. Catholic school? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2151.8999999999996s)]
*  Catholic school, first grade. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2153.14s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, I'm being controlled by this nun [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2154.5s)]
*  who was a fucking ruthless cunt. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2157.3399999999997s)]
*  It was the first time I'd ever been around a mean person. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2159.7s)]
*  I didn't have mean people to me in my life. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2162.62s)]
*  And this lady was just fucking openly vicious. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2166.02s)]
*  She said she was gonna make me sit on a nail in the closet [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2168.96s)]
*  because it was weird shit. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2172.2s)]
*  She would smack your hands and she would hit you. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2174.7599999999998s)]
*  They would do things, they would hit people in class. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2178.72s)]
*  I don't think she hit me. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2180.9s)]
*  I don't remember her hitting me, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2182.04s)]
*  but she hit people in class. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2182.96s)]
*  And I remember- [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2184.72s)]
*  Trauma bonding. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2185.8s)]
*  As a seven, no, six year old kid, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2186.8s)]
*  sitting there in that class going, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2189.24s)]
*  okay, I know this is all bullshit. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2190.7599999999998s)]
*  This is not what God would want. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2192.4s)]
*  These people don't represent God. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2193.6s)]
*  Because I was really into God. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2195.06s)]
*  My parents were getting split up when I was five [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2196.18s)]
*  and I was really lost. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2198.62s)]
*  And one of the things that I clung to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2200.18s)]
*  was religion as a young boy. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2201.46s)]
*  I didn't even really know what it meant, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2202.9s)]
*  but I wanted to believe that there was a God [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2204.12s)]
*  that made something good. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2205.7s)]
*  Well, you had formed the part of the brain [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2206.7799999999997s)]
*  where you have a sense of reality and fairness, right? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2209.38s)]
*  That's why they need to get you young for boot camp. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2212.64s)]
*  It's boot camp for kids. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2215.9s)]
*  I had gotten, by the time I had gotten to first grade, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2216.74s)]
*  I had experienced enough bullshit [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2219.34s)]
*  that I realized that this lady does not represent God. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2221.66s)]
*  This was just a mean old celibate lady. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2224.88s)]
*  And it was just, the whole thing was nasty [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2228.0s)]
*  and the way she treated the students was terrifying. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2229.96s)]
*  And from then on, I questioned things. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2232.64s)]
*  It literally set me down on a path from first grade. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2235.24s)]
*  And it was because they didn't get me when I was four. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2239.2s)]
*  They didn't get me when I was five. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2241.36s)]
*  They got me when I was six. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2242.48s)]
*  My parents had already split up. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2244.04s)]
*  I'd already seen some shit. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2245.64s)]
*  You know, I'd already seen enough chaos [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2247.88s)]
*  to know that people are fucking not what they say they are. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2250.32s)]
*  I'd seen enough shit behind the scenes. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2254.24s)]
*  No, they gotta get you. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2256.2999999999997s)]
*  That's why it's so useful to have adults [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2258.18s)]
*  that care about Pokemon, you know? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2260.5s)]
*  We keep you a five years old, one part of your brain forever. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2263.62s)]
*  Forever you're gonna worry. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2267.58s)]
*  I think that's vaccines. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2268.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2269.7799999999997s)]
*  Look, it's not either way. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2271.04s)]
*  It's like, oh, we noticed this effect from a chemical. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2272.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, we already know public record. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2276.58s)]
*  They dumped that cobalt, whatever, on black kids in Chicago. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2278.3399999999997s)]
*  We already know the shit they're willing to do to you [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2282.74s)]
*  at any given time. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2284.4399999999996s)]
*  So why, if you notice that some kids get autistic [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2285.72s)]
*  and they get savantism, why wouldn't you just see? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2288.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, what was the point of bringing all them Nazis over [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2291.9599999999996s)]
*  after the war with all their great science [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2294.9199999999996s)]
*  if we're not gonna test it out? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2297.12s)]
*  And these fuckers think they can do that to you. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2298.7599999999998s)]
*  They all think they can. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2300.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you remember the vaccine mandates, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2302.16s)]
*  but there's an example of it. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2304.08s)]
*  What am I, in the military? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2305.72s)]
*  I gotta take a vaccine? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2306.8399999999997s)]
*  Cause I didn't sign no papers. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2307.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, we're gonna nudge you if you wanna go to work. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2309.7599999999998s)]
*  Dude. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2313.3999999999996s)]
*  But that's all a money grab. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2314.24s)]
*  Well, okay. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2315.24s)]
*  But that's all a money grab. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2316.08s)]
*  That's for a certain level. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2316.8999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2318.4399999999996s)]
*  That's 100% what that is. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2320.0s)]
*  That's selling the most amount of vaccines possible. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2321.3999999999996s)]
*  And that, just look at the numbers. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2323.8399999999997s)]
*  That's worth hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2325.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2328.56s)]
*  Hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2329.3999999999996s)]
*  That's a money grab. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  Now, okay. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2332.2s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2333.04s)]
*  If you don't mandate them and you have more people [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2333.8799999999997s)]
*  that are surviving and getting through it [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2336.6s)]
*  and telling other people, it's fine, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2338.4s)]
*  you don't need the vaccine, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2340.3s)]
*  that cuts your profits in a massive way. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2341.38s)]
*  You know, shit. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2344.2200000000003s)]
*  A massive way. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2345.14s)]
*  But that's all that is. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2345.98s)]
*  Can I reach you? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2346.82s)]
*  You're looking into it too deeply. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2347.6600000000003s)]
*  They're not trying to make autistic people. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2348.54s)]
*  What do you mean all? [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2349.94s)]
*  First of all. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2350.94s)]
*  That's a money grab. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2351.78s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2352.7000000000003s)]
*  Okay, nevermind the autistic thing. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2354.26s)]
*  Of course it's a money grab. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2356.02s)]
*  And because you're right now not thinking like hock to a coin, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2357.14s)]
*  you're thinking like a poor person. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2360.06s)]
*  Well, like I make weapons. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2361.6600000000003s)]
*  I bet if I made more wars, I could sell more weapons. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2365.1800000000003s)]
*  100%. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2367.5s)]
*  I make fucking cures. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2369.1600000000003s)]
*  I bet if I made more diseases, I could sell more cures. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2370.0s)]
*  So the money grab is- [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2372.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, you don't make cures. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2373.56s)]
*  You make treatments. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2374.4s)]
*  You don't wanna make cures. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2376.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, right. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2377.28s)]
*  They openly discuss not wanting to have cures. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2378.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so you see how, so openly, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2381.4s)]
*  this is the thing, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2383.96s)]
*  cause people will be like, oh, you're conspiracies. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2384.84s)]
*  Dude, I almost never tell the conspiracies, I think. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2386.92s)]
*  I tell public record shit. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2389.6000000000004s)]
*  You tell them in the green room, you freak me out. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2392.52s)]
*  Yeah, just so, and here's why I do that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2394.6400000000003s)]
*  Everyone I meet, because I just wanna see- [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2397.02s)]
*  And he's corner him. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2399.26s)]
*  He's this fucking giant. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2402.9s)]
*  He lurches over people in the green room [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2404.18s)]
*  and he's like, oh, and did you know? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2405.98s)]
*  Well, one, because when then, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2407.7s)]
*  sometimes people say something so uninformed [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2409.54s)]
*  that I'm like, it is a triggering feeling. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2411.94s)]

*  15 years ago or something like that? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2420.98s)]

*  No, Jimbo's, comedy works. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2435.02s)]
*  I'm sorry, yes. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2436.22s)]
*  Comedy works in Montreal, yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2437.06s)]
*  So over time, what has happened is, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2438.46s)]
*  you have, through doing the Jimmy Dore Show, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2441.8199999999997s)]
*  you got exposed to all kinds of really fucked up, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2444.8599999999997s)]
*  real conspiracies. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2450.5s)]
*  Yeah, the news, it's called the news. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2452.62s)]
*  Yeah, but a real independent journalist, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2454.72s)]
*  like Jim, who's also a comic. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2460.16s)]
*  Right, so before that, well yeah, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2461.7999999999997s)]
*  definitely that's a big part of it. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2464.12s)]
*  That was it. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2465.56s)]
*  But before, so conspiracy almost like to relax [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2466.4s)]
*  after having to hear that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2468.94s)]
*  Before that was Barry Crimmins. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2470.56s)]
*  And when it takes on Barry Crimmins, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2472.04s)]
*  he used to tell me so much shit [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2473.64s)]
*  that I did not have the ears to hear. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2474.7999999999997s)]
*  And he would bring up Nicaragua all the time, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2478.2s)]
*  and something Reagan did, and I'd be like- [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2480.4s)]
*  Barry was a political commentator in a comic [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2482.28s)]
*  back when nobody was. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2484.86s)]
*  He was also the real deal with it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2486.0600000000004s)]
*  He wasn't a phony about it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2487.34s)]
*  No, no, no, no, he was the real deal with everything. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2490.1800000000003s)]
*  We toured, okay? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2491.98s)]
*  He wanted to tour me when the whole media [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2493.82s)]
*  tried to ruin me for a fucking month. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2497.42s)]
*  Which I always knew they kind of sucked, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2498.26s)]
*  but what I didn't know was that they just [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2500.38s)]
*  make shit up completely. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2501.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2503.34s)]
*  So that's the real first thing [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2504.1800000000003s)]
*  where I noticed there's a big problem. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2506.7400000000002s)]
*  The previous thing where I thought [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2509.1000000000004s)]
*  there might be a problem was, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2510.26s)]
*  I had forgotten if we were still in Iraq. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2511.62s)]
*  It had been some years. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2513.24s)]
*  I was like, are we still doing that? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2514.68s)]
*  It felt like I left the oven on, right? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2516.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2517.88s)]
*  And I had to Google if we were in Iraq still, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2518.72s)]
*  and then, so that disturbed me a little bit, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2521.0s)]
*  but I mean, I moved on with my life, obviously. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2523.0s)]
*  Then the media thing, and then on tour, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2525.56s)]
*  so Barry went on tour with me just to be seen with me [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2527.64s)]
*  because I was getting so much shit, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2529.92s)]
*  because he was very left. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2531.3399999999997s)]
*  He used to say, there's no left here, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2533.2799999999997s)]
*  and I would go, you could have fooled me. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2534.7799999999997s)]
*  And he was right. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2536.7999999999997s)]
*  So everybody's saying left and right here, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2538.0s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2539.8399999999997s)]
*  There's upstairs, downstairs, that's all there is. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2542.0s)]
*  But dude, it's the same as the public school memos [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2544.3599999999997s)]
*  from your Rockefellers and Carnegie's. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2547.7999999999997s)]
*  They've written down the thing openly [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2550.08s)]
*  and said what they're gonna do. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2552.16s)]
*  Alex Jones didn't make up the New World Order, okay? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2554.4399999999996s)]
*  Alex Jones didn't pull that out of his ass. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2557.12s)]
*  George H.W., a thousand points a light, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2559.2799999999997s)]

*  You just got the- [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2576.56s)]
*  I just got the demon behind the eyes. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2577.4s)]
*  We just locked eyes with each other for 15 seconds. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2579.2s)]
*  The Adrenochrome withdrawal eyes. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2580.4s)]
*  He just looked over at me and we looked at each other [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2582.48s)]
*  for like 15 seconds, dude. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2584.8s)]
*  The idea of like, I mean, do you need telepathy [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2586.4s)]
*  to read his mind when he looked at you? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2589.56s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2591.08s)]
*  But the thing is funny is, he looked at you [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2592.32s)]
*  almost like a fucking, you know, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2594.42s)]
*  that chick that blew him that they would've ruined. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2596.46s)]

*  They can get me with science. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2637.36s)]
*  You know, Barry Crimmins was the glue [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2638.52s)]
*  that kept the Boston comedy community together. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2640.52s)]

*  You know, the guy that's like, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2657.06s)]
*  if Barry was far left, you would call him. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2658.42s)]
*  Well, he was far left, but supported American workers, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2660.14s)]
*  American made things. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2663.2200000000003s)]
*  He would like drink Budweiser, you know, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2664.9s)]
*  like he would pull Budweiser out of his jacket on stage. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2667.42s)]
*  He wouldn't drink foreign beer. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2670.06s)]
*  He was a real deal and a really fucking beautiful person. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2671.78s)]
*  Well, you know how the left transition, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2675.98s)]
*  see, it's all about transitioning. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2677.3s)]
*  Nothing means anything. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2679.7400000000002s)]
*  So what we do is take the meeting, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2681.14s)]
*  we take the whole series of words [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2683.6800000000003s)]
*  and we all stick our dick in it and gape the word [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2685.1600000000003s)]
*  until all the meaning slides out of it. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2688.04s)]
*  So nothing means shit. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2690.6400000000003s)]
*  A vaccine don't mean a vaccine. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2692.2000000000003s)]
*  Whatever you thought a vaccine was, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2693.52s)]
*  a thing that makes you not get the thing. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2694.96s)]
*  It's never been that. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2696.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2698.2400000000002s)]

*  I'm never letting that go. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2707.4s)]
*  I read that in Forbes. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2709.0s)]
*  You must never do your own research. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2711.38s)]
*  Can I finish this issue of Forbes at least? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2715.14s)]
*  Do I have to put it down right now? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2718.18s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2720.14s)]
*  Well, what's crazy about them saying that [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2721.42s)]
*  is all the things they were saying [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2723.14s)]
*  that were conspiracy theories, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2725.04s)]
*  because this is all in regards, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2726.58s)]
*  do your own research stuff, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2728.46s)]
*  was all in regards to COVID-19. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2729.9s)]
*  All the things that people were saying [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2732.06s)]
*  that they were calling a conspiracy theory [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2734.86s)]
*  turned out to be true. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2736.7s)]
*  Every single one of them, but yet no correction, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2737.7400000000002s)]
*  but yet they still wanna be the people [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2739.96s)]
*  that give you the news. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2742.02s)]
*  Hey, you know where the term tinfoil hat came from, right? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2743.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2746.06s)]
*  Okay, control old history. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2747.1s)]
*  I can't recommend this channel enough. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2748.46s)]
*  Lotta like recent history, but tinfoil hat. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2750.54s)]
*  A guy named Leonard Kyle, K-I-L-E-S. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2754.34s)]
*  He had patents on like Polaroid camera shit. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2756.9s)]
*  Okay, he was a smart guy. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2760.58s)]
*  Thought his girlfriend was cheating on him [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2761.98s)]
*  and he would fly into rages and was seeing a therapist. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2763.18s)]
*  Bad luck for him, this therapist was a CIA guy. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2765.7s)]
*  Yeah, Delgado. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2768.6s)]
*  Those old things with the bowl where it doesn't charge [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2770.72s)]
*  because they're putting, it's a chip. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2773.12s)]
*  The brain chip has been invented a long time ago. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2774.84s)]
*  So they put this in this guy's head [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2777.92s)]
*  without telling him, a brain chip, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2779.86s)]
*  and then it turned him into, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2781.96s)]
*  I mean, it just fucked him up, okay? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2784.7599999999998s)]
*  And he ended up in a booby hatch. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2786.92s)]
*  And the pain from, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2788.86s)]
*  because microwaves have to be transmitted to his chip. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2790.3199999999997s)]
*  So the pain of that in his brain [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2793.14s)]
*  made him put metal trash cans on his head, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2795.0s)]
*  because he's smart. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2796.74s)]
*  He knew science things and what they were using, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2797.74s)]
*  even though he was in pain. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2799.62s)]
*  And then they started letting him use aluminum foil [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2801.2999999999997s)]
*  around his fucking head. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2803.54s)]
*  And that's, so we get the term tin foil hat [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2804.8999999999996s)]
*  from a guy the CIA mutilated and fucked up. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2808.02s)]
*  And now we say it as a joke. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2811.22s)]
*  You see how magic works? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2812.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2814.3199999999997s)]
*  What was the implant they put in on him? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2815.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, what was it called? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2818.74s)]
*  The one they made in the 90s called Soul Catcher, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2820.14s)]
*  which is ominous. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2822.12s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2823.06s)]
*  Yeah, Soul Catcher. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2824.2799999999997s)]
*  Right, that's what they called it. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2825.12s)]
*  That was on the CNET. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2826.42s)]
*  I texted it to you, dude. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2827.7s)]
*  The British telecom. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2828.9s)]
*  They probably got lost in that fucking scroll [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2830.7400000000002s)]
*  that you texted me. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2832.58s)]
*  Hey, if you're worried about the new Elon chip, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2833.42s)]
*  I got great news, guys. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2834.38s)]
*  They don't need a chip to do their thing no more. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2835.66s)]
*  They did it. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2837.48s)]
*  Why do you think people go, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2838.58s)]
*  what is this woke mind virus? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2839.42s)]
*  Well, it's a lot like the COVID virus, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2842.2200000000003s)]
*  a thing a guy made. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2843.96s)]
*  Why would you even work on something like that [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2847.26s)]
*  unless you were gonna deploy it? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2848.94s)]
*  The CIA verifies, oh, they did think it was a leak. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2851.1s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2854.92s)]
*  What I think it was on purpose [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2856.5800000000004s)]
*  because I don't know why you're fucking around with that [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2857.92s)]
*  if it ain't on purpose. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2859.6200000000003s)]
*  But why are you doing this gain of function research [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2861.2200000000003s)]
*  if you're not trying to find a cure? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2864.86s)]
*  Because they clearly didn't have a cure. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2866.32s)]
*  A cure for a disease that doesn't exist yet? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2867.86s)]
*  That's suspicious. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2869.6200000000003s)]
*  Hey, how come all the new viruses that come out, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2871.42s)]
*  the explanation, the not racist and good explanation [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2874.3s)]

*  because that's how science works, obviously, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2878.5s)]
*  by not doing research, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2880.86s)]

*  All of them? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2885.7799999999997s)]
*  Why do these freaks do this shit and then you get blamed? [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2888.74s)]
*  So they go, so you create a virus in the lab? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2892.2599999999998s)]

*  and then it's blamed on you and it's in everything, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2901.38s)]
*  the sci-fi. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2903.62s)]

*  Right? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2921.98s)]

*  Right? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2924.48s)]
*  Don't pollute and then they erase your memory [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2925.6s)]
*  so you have to pay for fucking hypnotherapy [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2927.56s)]
*  to remember not to pollute. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=2929.48s)]

*  There's a lot of misinformation that's going on, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3048.48s)]
*  I think, purposely to try to muddy the narrative. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3050.16s)]
*  Why? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3052.96s)]
*  I think it's ours. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3053.7999999999997s)]
*  Of course. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3055.22s)]
*  I think a lot of that stuff is, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3056.06s)]
*  but I also think we get visited. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3056.8799999999997s)]

*  I think one of the ways to kind of continue to hide it [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3064.8599999999997s)]
*  is to have our stuff and then eventually it leaks [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3069.02s)]
*  that we have advanced technology. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3073.58s)]

*  And what are we emulating and are we in contact? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3078.06s)]
*  And are all those stories, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3082.4399999999996s)]
*  what's going on under the ocean? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3083.8s)]

*  that they can go from the ocean to the surface, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3092.7200000000003s)]
*  outside, into space, back into the water, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3094.94s)]

*  So is that ours? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3100.5600000000004s)]
*  Or is that some shit that comes from somewhere else? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3103.3s)]
*  Okay, yes they have it. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3107.2000000000003s)]
*  Or is it a combination of all those things? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3108.76s)]
*  No, it's not ours. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3110.1200000000003s)]

*  that comes from the old man in the mountain, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3280.62s)]
*  the assassin, the term assassin, it's in video games. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3282.38s)]
*  The term assassin. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3285.62s)]
*  But you're saying this is like everybody knows it, right? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3286.64s)]
*  Jamie, you and I are pretty balls deep in conspiracies. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3290.32s)]
*  I don't know what he's talking about. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3292.4s)]
*  This is historical facts. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3293.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I'm following, he is everywhere, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3294.68s)]
*  but I'm following a lot of this. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3296.34s)]
*  Okay, these are historical facts, the assassins. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3297.18s)]
*  Checking stuff. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3299.12s)]
*  Well, what did they do? [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3299.96s)]
*  There's a Sufi order of Islam, and the guy, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3300.78s)]
*  he would, they called the old man in the mountain. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3305.32s)]
*  They show in the Marco Polo Netflix series, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3307.64s)]
*  he goes to visit the old man in the mountain, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3310.04s)]
*  and he had assassins, like young men, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3311.52s)]
*  probably kid to like teen, and they'd smoke hashish. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3314.66s)]
*  That's why it's called assassin from hashish. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3318.06s)]
*  Really? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3320.02s)]
*  You're knocked out on hashish, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3320.8599999999997s)]
*  because you never smoked it before you're a kid, right? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3322.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3324.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, and then you wake up in a paradise garden [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3325.14s)]
*  that this guy has filled with women that fuck you, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3327.2999999999997s)]
*  and then you go to, they smoke some hashish, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3330.42s)]
*  you go to sleep, you come out again, like that's heaven. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3332.7s)]
*  You get 72 virgins in a garden in heaven. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3335.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3338.5s)]
*  This is like, it's more towards Shia, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3339.3399999999997s)]
*  but I don't think Shia would, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3341.2999999999997s)]
*  they'd probably call him a hairy tick up. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3342.62s)]
*  I don't know Islam too well, but that's what that's from. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3343.96s)]
*  The 72 virgins is not a Quran thing. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3346.68s)]
*  Well, also, it doesn't mean 72, it means like a fuckload. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3348.8s)]
*  That's what it means. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3352.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3353.32s)]
*  When you say 72, it's like, if you have 72 wives, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3354.2400000000002s)]
*  it's impossible to have that many wives. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3356.96s)]
*  That heaven is a kind of like a dick Valhalla, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3358.28s)]
*  pussy Valhalla you get to go to. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3361.28s)]
*  Okay, but that comes directly from assassins. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3363.52s)]
*  That's to trick young men into killing people, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3365.4s)]
*  and so they would kill a guy and get killed doing it, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3367.2400000000002s)]
*  and they had all these ways of doing it. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3369.44s)]
*  It's a historical thing. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3370.52s)]
*  And they thought they were gonna go to heaven [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3371.62s)]
*  and be in that place where they had all the girls. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3372.74s)]
*  So that's a very effective form of mind control. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3374.18s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3376.4199999999996s)]
*  If I can put on a show for you that you believe is real, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3377.7s)]
*  whatever it could be, if I put enough Disney magic into it, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3381.22s)]
*  you believe anything. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3383.98s)]
*  Right, and if I have an island, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3384.8199999999997s)]
*  and if I can fly everybody in on private jets, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3386.14s)]
*  and you know you're gonna party with Bill Clinton, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3388.1s)]
*  and Nobel laureates. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3390.18s)]
*  Yeah, and you can take advantage of, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3391.02s)]
*  the kind of girls that go for you if you're a super nerd. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3392.62s)]
*  And there's other nerds there, there's other nerds. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3394.4599999999996s)]
*  Dude, think of these nerds, these tech nerds, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3395.7799999999997s)]
*  the kind of women that go for them. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3397.3799999999997s)]
*  They're either like, you ever see Real Genius [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3398.8199999999997s)]
*  with Val Kilmer? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3401.7s)]
*  And there's that chick that wants to fuck all the geniuses. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3402.72s)]
*  What is it? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3405.4399999999996s)]
*  Real Genius with Val Kilmer. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3406.2799999999997s)]
*  Is it a movie? Yeah, from the 80s. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3407.48s)]
*  No, I didn't see that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3408.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, anyway. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3409.6s)]
*  Did you see it, Jamie? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3410.7599999999998s)]
*  I think so. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3411.6s)]
*  But there was one girl that tries to fuck Mitch, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3413.0s)]
*  the main character, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3415.06s)]
*  because she fucks all the smart kids in the school. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3416.4399999999996s)]
*  God, Val Kilmer was a handsome bastard. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3418.96s)]
*  Yeah, he plays a handsome scientist. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3420.6s)]
*  Perfect teeth. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3424.3199999999997s)]
*  Good fucking movie, dude. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3425.16s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3426.2s)]
*  Yeah, I really like it. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3427.22s)]
*  I saw it when I was really young. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3428.3999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, that eugenics shit, we're like, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3430.3s)]
*  we're smart, we should breed. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3433.1400000000003s)]
*  There's just some chicks like comedians, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3434.42s)]
*  some like musicians, some of them like super nerds. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3437.1800000000003s)]
*  So now, let's say I want to control important things [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3441.34s)]
*  like a nerd's brain, and how do I manipulate a nerd? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3444.02s)]
*  Well, I send pussy to them. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3446.34s)]
*  I make them feel cool. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3447.98s)]
*  I give them my island. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3450.54s)]
*  And then, listen, it's probably easier [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3451.54s)]
*  than bullying Bieber. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3453.5s)]
*  Well, it's definitely the best way [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3454.42s)]
*  if you want to push a narrative, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3455.98s)]
*  and you want award-winning scientists [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3458.64s)]
*  behind your narrative. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3461.92s)]
*  We own the science, they said. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3462.88s)]
*  If you want to own the science, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3464.44s)]
*  you have to compromise the scientists. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3465.68s)]
*  You're right. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3467.44s)]
*  I want to ask, I like Eric Weinstein when he's on here, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3468.2799999999997s)]
*  because I'm always trying to listen [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3470.3599999999997s)]
*  when somebody's picking up. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3472.16s)]
*  I want to ask, I watch Brian Keating all the time, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3473.4s)]
*  and he was telling you that thing [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3476.3599999999997s)]
*  about why maybe there's no alien. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3477.46s)]
*  I didn't really, it went nowhere, what he said, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3478.7999999999997s)]
*  but I do like him. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3480.6s)]
*  But I want to ask all these nerds, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3481.8399999999997s)]
*  who's paying for your scientific materialist nerd shit, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3484.0s)]
*  compartmentalized view that you have, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3488.0s)]
*  and your respective expertise? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3490.0s)]
*  Because here's where we're at. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3491.84s)]
*  All the experts told me women have dicks, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3492.92s)]
*  and they told me a gene therapy was a vaccine. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3496.04s)]
*  We don't trust the shit that you went to school for, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3498.44s)]
*  like the pat on the head Nobel Prize horse shit. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3502.2s)]
*  The Nobel Prize, is there any more worthless [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3506.34s)]
*  fucking joke of a prize than a Nobel Prize? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3509.0s)]
*  You gotta be a mass murderer to get one of those. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3512.0s)]
*  Do you know the history of the Nobel Prize? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3514.48s)]
*  Yeah, because some fucking, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3515.72s)]
*  so some rich asshole could ease his conscience, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3517.94s)]
*  but I don't even think it's for, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3520.7s)]
*  I think it's to control the fucking. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3521.54s)]
*  But no, no, no, no, no. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3522.98s)]
*  The guy, there was a false obituary. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3524.06s)]
*  They made a mistake and thought that he died, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3527.94s)]
*  and they called him the merchant of death in the obituary, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3530.02s)]
*  because he made dynamite. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3533.0s)]
*  So to whitewash his image, he decides to have a prize [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3534.46s)]
*  that he gives to the brightest minds. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3538.24s)]
*  So his name now gets associated [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3540.2599999999998s)]
*  with the most high achieving brilliance. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3542.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's despicable. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3544.86s)]
*  It's kind of amazing though, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3546.14s)]

*  And do you remember the one? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3637.16s)]
*  I'm sure they stopped. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3638.48s)]
*  They did it in St. Louis? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3639.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3640.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they sprayed it off the top of a building. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3641.6s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't even use the chemtrail [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3643.72s)]
*  they did off the top of the building [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3645.48s)]
*  on the blackheads in a building, just to see. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3646.58s)]
*  But wasn't it LSD? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3648.6s)]
*  No, that's San Francisco, this was cobalt. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3650.0s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3652.68s)]
*  I don't remember, it's cobalt something, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3653.52s)]
*  it's radioactive. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3655.2s)]
*  Oh, that's right, it was to judge [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3656.36s)]
*  whether or not they would be poisoned. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3658.42s)]
*  And what level of poisoning they could survive. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3660.48s)]
*  It sounds Nazi-ish, don't it? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3663.14s)]
*  Super. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3664.58s)]
*  I wonder if Dr. Green was involved. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3665.42s)]
*  You know who Dr. Green is, right? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3666.94s)]

*  Before you go down, Dr. Green. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3671.06s)]
*  What was that experiment? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3673.04s)]
*  Someone told me there was one where they sprayed LSD [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3675.18s)]
*  into the atmosphere. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3679.14s)]

*  No, no, no, San Francisco was pneumonia. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3680.98s)]
*  St. Louis Dora Spates was a baby [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3684.62s)]
*  and her father died inexplicably. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3686.2599999999998s)]
*  She has watched her siblings die of cancer. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3687.62s)]
*  She survived cervical cancer. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3689.38s)]
*  During the army conducted secret chemical testing [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3691.44s)]

*  that could shield St. Louis from aerial observation [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3719.06s)]
*  in case the Russians attacked. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3721.66s)]
*  But in 1994, the government said the tests [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3723.54s)]
*  were part of a biological weapons program [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3725.66s)]

*  to Russian cities that the US might attack. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3731.14s)]

*  Lisa Moreno-Taylor's research has raised the possibility [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3750.7200000000003s)]
*  that the army performed radiation testing [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3753.88s)]

*  Do you have weed? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3767.92s)]
*  Yeah, but her report released last month [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3768.88s)]
*  was troubling enough that both US senators from Missouri [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3771.88s)]

*  into the clouds. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3791.5800000000004s)]

*  Yeah, what was the San Francisco one? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3797.34s)]
*  I think they had the fog coming in [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3799.9s)]
*  and they wanted to see if they could distribute [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3802.64s)]
*  a disease that way. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=3805.16s)]

*  Right, explain that to people. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4154.0s)]
*  Explain that because we've talked about it before, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4155.2s)]
*  but it was a big moment. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4157.04s)]
*  It was 2015, right? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4158.24s)]
*  I thought it was 14, but. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4160.08s)]
*  Whatever. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4161.4s)]
*  It was in that range. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4162.24s)]
*  Well, the world ended in 2012. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4163.64s)]
*  They legalized propaganda. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4164.96s)]
*  Yeah, so it used to be illegal to propagandize your own. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4166.88s)]
*  The CIA, but the CIA works in other countries. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4169.24s)]
*  They're not Americans. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4171.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, after 9-11 and now they work here. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4173.34s)]
*  Then Obama signed a thing [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4177.88s)]
*  that they can propagandize citizens. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4181.24s)]
*  That means through the media. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4183.52s)]
*  Yeah, legally. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4184.68s)]
*  That means bots on your Twitter. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4185.84s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4188.52s)]
*  They got deployed on Twitter and shit. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4189.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4190.88s)]
*  And so. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4191.72s)]
*  Well, not just bots, but it might be most of the discourse. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4192.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, they call it the dead internet theory. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4195.52s)]
*  It's not dead, there's living CIA. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4197.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4201.12s)]
*  US repeals propaganda ban, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4201.96s)]
*  spreads government-made news to Americans. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4203.36s)]
*  Why? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4205.88s)]
*  Government-made news is great. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4206.740000000001s)]
*  Where does it say the date? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4208.06s)]
*  Is that phrase, government-made news is amazing. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4208.900000000001s)]
*  The thing, the problem is like with any other job, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4211.3s)]
*  if you've been wrong so many times, you would get fired. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4213.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you would, wouldn't you? [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4216.62s)]
*  If you lied so many times, no one would trust you [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4218.1s)]
*  to be the only people to get to distribute the news. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4221.3s)]
*  So why do you think it's still, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4224.18s)]
*  oh, why do you think it still works? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4225.42s)]
*  How is that legal to propagandize American citizens [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4227.18s)]
*  with lies? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4230.34s)]
*  Not only that, but you don't have to tell people about it. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4231.16s)]
*  So like it doesn't have to go through an approval process. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4233.52s)]
*  If you tell people about it, you should go stay in Russia [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4236.4400000000005s)]
*  because we're gonna try to kill you. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4239.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you can't tell people about it. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4240.200000000001s)]
*  People still hate Snowden. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4242.52s)]
*  There's people who think that that guy [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4243.6s)]
*  did something wrong on any level. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4244.84s)]
*  Yo, the oath is to you, you, me, not to the fucking- [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4247.04s)]
*  But here's what it is, is that you don't, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4250.120000000001s)]
*  it's not saying you should never have intelligence agencies. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4253.54s)]
*  You should have intelligence agencies. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4256.52s)]
*  The world's a dangerous fucking crazy place. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4258.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4260.4800000000005s)]
*  But also, you gotta have rules. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4261.320000000001s)]
*  They should be accountable to somebody. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4263.72s)]
*  Well, you have to have rules, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4265.22s)]
*  and one of the rules should be [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4266.22s)]
*  you can't turn that shit on us. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4267.38s)]
*  That should be the rules. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4269.42s)]
*  You shouldn't be working in conjunction [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4270.34s)]
*  with a specific party, and your set goal [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4273.66s)]
*  is to establish a specific candidate, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4277.0199999999995s)]
*  and so to do that, you are going to use propaganda [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4279.78s)]
*  on the American public for a particular candidate [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4283.38s)]
*  that's running for president [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4286.42s)]
*  in the United States of America. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4287.94s)]
*  You are gonna decide to lie and use propaganda, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4289.98s)]
*  and it's legal. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4293.08s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4294.0199999999995s)]
*  You're supposed to do that in Guatemala. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4295.839999999999s)]
*  You're not supposed to do that here. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4296.679999999999s)]
*  You're supposed to do that in other countries. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4297.5199999999995s)]
*  They're supposed to be, first of all, there's- [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4298.639999999999s)]
*  And you're not even supposed to do that, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4300.639999999999s)]
*  but that's what we think you're doing. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4302.12s)]
*  Well, you think you're just move on. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4305.5599999999995s)]
*  You think you're overthrowing governments [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4306.4s)]
*  in other countries. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4307.5199999999995s)]
*  I just don't think about it too much and move on. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4308.36s)]
*  I'm watching Land Man later tonight. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4310.04s)]
*  It's a good show. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4311.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a- [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4312.639999999999s)]
*  I'm on episode five. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4313.48s)]
*  Well, I like it because it gives you a real education [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4314.719999999999s)]
*  from the petroleum industry, who pays for it. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4317.32s)]
*  It's like, by the way, I'm not against, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4320.639999999999s)]
*  but I don't think that oil is even scarce now. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4322.84s)]
*  I used to think that, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4325.46s)]
*  and then I saw that Colonel Prouty thing. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4326.34s)]
*  See, here's what happens. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4329.08s)]
*  Once you get to gray beard times, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4330.46s)]
*  that's when you're an idiot [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4331.9800000000005s)]
*  that doesn't know anything all of a sudden, right? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4332.82s)]
*  And that's what- [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4334.900000000001s)]
*  So Barry, who told me all this shit, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4335.74s)]
*  that I was like, all right, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4337.08s)]
*  now I understand what he was telling me, all this stuff. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4338.9400000000005s)]
*  But now I've already aged out of the demographic [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4341.34s)]
*  of who gives a shit what you had to say. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4343.76s)]
*  You know, I read a book in like, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4345.5s)]
*  God, it was probably like the 90s, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4347.5s)]
*  called Black Gold Stranglehold. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4348.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a crazy book. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4351.14s)]
*  I don't know if it's even been disproven, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4352.66s)]
*  because this is back in the days [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4354.32s)]
*  when I wasn't really reading things on the internet. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4355.4s)]
*  I was just getting stuff from actual books. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4357.88s)]
*  So I didn't like research [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4360.139999999999s)]
*  whether or not this book was bullshit. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4361.12s)]
*  But essentially the theory was that [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4362.8s)]
*  oil is a natural process of earth, and it regenerates. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4365.12s)]
*  And that's why some wells that used to be dry [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4369.04s)]
*  now produce oil again. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4371.96s)]
*  The idea that it's a property of earth [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4373.68s)]
*  that we're tapping into, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4375.72s)]
*  and it's not as simple as like, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4376.96s)]
*  this is a finite resource. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4379.04s)]
*  Like diamonds. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4383.299999999999s)]
*  Sort of, but diamonds take millions and millions of years [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4384.94s)]
*  to make a diamond. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4388.139999999999s)]
*  But there's not a shortage, they artificially. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4388.98s)]
*  Well that's true, there's not a shortage. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4389.94s)]
*  So if you do that for diamonds. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4391.379999999999s)]
*  But the earth is not replacing diamonds all the time, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4392.94s)]
*  like it's replacing oil. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4395.0599999999995s)]
*  The theory is that, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4396.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're right, yeah. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4397.36s)]
*  The theory is that earth, you know, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4398.5s)]
*  cause earth has a finite amount of gold, right? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4400.339999999999s)]
*  It's a shockingly small amount of gold. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4402.259999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4404.58s)]
*  What they know, they actually just found [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4405.78s)]
*  some new gold in China, so that might change that. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4407.44s)]
*  Because they just found a, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4410.299999999999s)]
*  they found a huge amount of gold in China, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4411.3s)]
*  like an enormous discovery. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4414.92s)]
*  But the amount of gold physically, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4417.7s)]
*  they've showed it on like football fields, it's crazy. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4420.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4423.320000000001s)]
*  It's like a football field of gold, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4424.16s)]
*  it's like 10 feet high, in the whole world. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4424.9800000000005s)]
*  But gold has a very unique property. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4427.08s)]
*  What is it? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4429.12s)]
*  In that you could take a tiny, tiny piece of gold [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4429.96s)]
*  and coat this entire table. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4432.04s)]
*  Gold can be spread insanely thin. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4434.08s)]
*  That's why a lot of things are gold plated. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4436.38s)]
*  You know, like it looks like gold, but it's not gold. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4438.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like steel, but then over that, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4441.74s)]
*  they've got the thinnest layer. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4443.3s)]
*  And the more amount of gold versus steel [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4445.96s)]
*  is like 18 karat, 24 karat, like the more, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4448.26s)]
*  the purer the gold is. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4450.38s)]
*  But pure gold in like a form of coating things, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4451.38s)]
*  that's why they paint ceilings with it and shit. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4455.54s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4457.54s)]
*  Yeah, it gets, you can get it insanely thin. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4458.38s)]
*  It's a super, super unique metal. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4461.76s)]
*  Even a thin layer of gold, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4464.38s)]
*  like how much heavier does it make something? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4465.76s)]
*  Oh, it must make something much heavier. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4468.18s)]
*  Gold's so heavy. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4469.7s)]
*  But what's really fascinating is that gold doesn't serve [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4471.86s)]
*  any functional purpose to evolving man, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4473.62s)]
*  but yet in that time period, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4476.74s)]
*  it became the number one source of currency. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4478.58s)]
*  Like in the time period before metal, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4481.18s)]
*  like before we were able to make steel, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4483.02s)]
*  and before people had electronics, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4485.62s)]
*  gold way, way back in the day was the thing [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4488.26s)]
*  for no fucking reason. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4492.22s)]
*  There's all these other things that look pretty. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4494.06s)]
*  Like why did we decide that this is kind of metal? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4495.58s)]
*  You told me why, because you can spread it thinner. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4498.06s)]
*  So you know how like Tom Cruise [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4500.3s)]
*  has to learn to read with Play-Doh? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4501.9s)]
*  What? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4503.62s)]
*  You know in Scientology, he has to play, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4505.0199999999995s)]
*  you have to model a thing. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4506.74s)]
*  Oh, Play-Doh, I thought you meant Play-Doh, the philosopher. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4507.66s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4510.78s)]
*  No, Play-Doh, the... [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4511.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4513.219999999999s)]
*  The dough. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4514.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm so interested to see how you're gonna tie this [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4516.0199999999995s)]
*  around to gold. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4517.74s)]
*  Well, it's like that's a, like a child, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4519.139999999999s)]
*  play with Play-Doh, like that's the metal [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4522.7s)]
*  that's the easiest to work like a child. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4524.5s)]
*  Yes, it is, but it just doesn't make sense [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4526.38s)]
*  that people would be in the time [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4528.5s)]
*  where you needed a sword, why would you be willing [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4530.599999999999s)]
*  to trade a piece of shiny useless metal [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4532.2s)]
*  for something that's functional, it's gonna save your life. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4534.919999999999s)]
*  Oh, because if I'm creative, right, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4536.879999999999s)]
*  and I, you know, basically all this shit's [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4538.839999999999s)]
*  the endless battle of priest versus king. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4541.639999999999s)]
*  Now the engineers want in, but the guy that figured out [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4543.96s)]
*  how to work the gold and read and write and do that, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4548.12s)]
*  then they started breeding the kings themselves. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4550.96s)]
*  That's what Egypt is, it's inbred kings. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4553.36s)]
*  I think the better version of it is the Anunnaki version. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4554.839999999999s)]
*  The Anunnaki version is that human beings [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4557.700000000001s)]
*  are the product of accelerated evolution [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4560.38s)]
*  and we were essentially designed to mine gold [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4562.66s)]
*  for this alien race that needs it [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4565.5s)]
*  to protect their environment. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4567.14s)]
*  And this is in- [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4568.900000000001s)]
*  Because you can spread it, you can smear it [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4569.740000000001s)]
*  all over the environment. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4571.18s)]
*  This is in Zechariah Sitchin's The 12th Planet. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4572.200000000001s)]
*  And so what he said is that the Sumerian tablets [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4575.14s)]
*  talk about how their atmosphere was eroding [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4577.72s)]
*  and that they needed to spray gold at their atmosphere [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4581.1s)]
*  to maintain their atmosphere. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4583.66s)]
*  What's crazy about that is this is exactly [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4584.700000000001s)]
*  what these fucking eggheads are talking about doing today [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4586.96s)]
*  by spraying reflective particles in our atmosphere. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4590.06s)]
*  Well, because that Anunnaki shit's from their cult. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4592.82s)]
*  Gold would be the perfect metal for that is what my point. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4594.86s)]
*  You could get gold dust can get so fine. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4597.46s)]
*  It's a very weird metal, man. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4600.66s)]
*  It's weird and it's weird that we are so obsessed with it [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4602.78s)]
*  and it doesn't really, other than like conductors [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4606.3s)]
*  and stuff like in electronics, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4608.78s)]
*  it has a function later in life, but way longer, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4610.22s)]
*  way, way back in the day when you have Jade and emeralds [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4613.54s)]
*  and all these other things that should be like super valuable [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4616.94s)]
*  as well. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4619.12s)]
*  Why gold? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4619.96s)]
*  Why does that become the number one thing [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4620.879999999999s)]
*  that everybody agrees we have to have? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4622.48s)]
*  You can make it into shit and say it's magic. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4624.32s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4626.5199999999995s)]
*  No, you can make an atmosphere or a nice gold chain. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4628.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's not enough. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4632.0s)]
*  It's not enough to make everybody kill people. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4633.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, it's no hawk to a coin. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4636.24s)]
*  Yeah, but this, you're talking about this happened [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4638.44s)]
*  at the time where people had animal skins on, you know, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4640.58s)]
*  you're, you're, you're talking about the time [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4643.48s)]
*  when people like regularly just wore animal skins [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4644.92s)]
*  and made all their tools with Flint, you know, like- [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4647.52s)]
*  Is this before Noah's Ark? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4650.56s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4651.72s)]
*  When does gold start being a currency? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4653.0s)]
*  I'd like to know. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4655.6s)]
*  700 BC. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4656.4400000000005s)]
*  700 BC. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4657.26s)]
*  You know what, you know what I like, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4658.56s)]
*  the story I like of, you know, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4660.14s)]
*  cause you always hear about the book of Enoch now. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4661.64s)]
*  And so they name like the different, you know, angels that, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4664.6s)]
*  the thing of accelerating evolution, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4669.04s)]
*  if I read between the lines of that with my cynical eye [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4671.12s)]
*  from the COVID times, I look at that as, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4673.68s)]
*  we did bestiality experiments. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4676.4800000000005s)]
*  That's how I read that. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4678.96s)]
*  If you read like bail cycle and all that kind of shit. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4681.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4683.52s)]
*  I don't want to get off track here for a second though. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4684.72s)]
*  So this was 200 BC. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4686.46s)]
*  So that's 2,225 years ago, right? [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4689.34s)]
*  That's when they first started using it as currency. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4694.280000000001s)]
*  Roughly 700 BC. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4697.200000000001s)]
*  But I thought they use it as currency [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4698.4800000000005s)]
*  in like Mesopotamia too. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4700.14s)]
*  I thought like those kinds of expensive coins. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4702.08s)]
*  I thought it's like associated with the sun and shit. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4705.72s)]
*  Well they know that there's Roman coins [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4707.88s)]
*  that are thousands of years old, right? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4709.64s)]
*  Isn't it sun related to people back then? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4711.38s)]
*  I thought that's the official thing. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4713.28s)]
*  That gold was sun related? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4715.2s)]
*  Look, I'm not saying that gold isn't, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4716.48s)]
*  like anything that's rare is probably valuable to people. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4718.32s)]
*  That seems to be a thing. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4721.64s)]
*  Like we like limited edition things. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4722.8s)]
*  Like people like, they specifically like things [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4724.56s)]
*  that are hard to acquire. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4726.64s)]
*  Like we were talking about like artifacts earlier. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4727.48s)]
*  That's part of the thing. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4729.72s)]
*  I'll bet with gold and Trump shoes. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4730.64s)]
*  Okay, here goes 5,000 years ago, Mesopotamia. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4732.160000000001s)]
*  Okay, they stamped silver and gold coins to pay armies. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4734.56s)]
*  So it goes back further than that. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4737.8s)]
*  So the earliest known mints. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4740.400000000001s)]
*  The Mesopotamian shekel. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4742.4800000000005s)]
*  They emerged, okay, the first known form of currency [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4744.04s)]
*  emerged nearly 5,000 years ago. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4747.56s)]
*  Not necessarily gold though. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4749.6s)]
*  It was just currency. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4751.4400000000005s)]
*  It could have been made out of whatever they had. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4752.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, you know what? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4753.200000000001s)]
*  Didn't they have currency that was also like beads? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4754.04s)]
*  Yeah, that this was saying and that other. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4756.64s)]
*  So then they switched to gold around. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4758.44s)]
*  So it is the same around the same timeline. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4760.639999999999s)]
*  Gold became just like the first accepted wide. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4762.679999999999s)]
*  I think the first currency is blood. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4763.919999999999s)]
*  That was the first currency was blood. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4765.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, so it doesn't go as far back as I thought. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4767.08s)]
*  I thought that would make sense [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4769.08s)]
*  why we're so infatuated with gold. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4770.799999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't give a shit about it. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4774.08s)]
*  But the Zechariah Sitchin thing, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4774.919999999999s)]
*  what's interesting is he wrote about that in the 1970s. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4775.919999999999s)]
*  And then scientists in like the 2000s [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4779.44s)]
*  started proposing it as a solution [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4782.44s)]
*  to our eroding environment. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4784.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4787.0s)]
*  That they have, cause he's a wild fringe theorist. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4788.24s)]
*  And yet this is why I ask scientists, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4791.76s)]
*  why do rich people, the ones that pay for you [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4793.92s)]
*  to be a scientific materialist, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4796.08s)]
*  all your specialized knowledge, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4797.8s)]
*  they believe in fucking Zechariah Sitchin shit? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4799.88s)]
*  Do you ever ask yourself that? [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4804.76s)]
*  Why do they think that? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4805.96s)]
*  A lot of people don't believe in him though. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4806.8s)]
*  Okay, here's why I do. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4808.2s)]
*  Yo, that's why you gotta read Joseph P. Farrell. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4809.48s)]
*  I told you that guy's great. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4811.08s)]
*  Cause a very interesting thing about Sitchin, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4812.52s)]
*  his background, okay? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4814.48s)]
*  He got into it from his antiquing or something. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4817.360000000001s)]
*  He's in Rockefeller Center. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4819.8s)]
*  It's like who funded him doing all this? [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4821.2s)]
*  Well, you know what's interesting? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4823.400000000001s)]
*  On Rockefeller Center, I'll give you a hint. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4824.240000000001s)]
*  It was Rockefeller Center. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4825.88s)]
*  So that motherfucker was definitely into that shit. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4828.400000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4832.0s)]
*  That shit? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4832.84s)]
*  Yeah, like Shirley MacLean. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4833.66s)]
*  Here's an example. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4834.76s)]
*  Shirley MacLean used to be like [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4835.6s)]
*  the Atlantis celebrity, right? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4836.92s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4838.400000000001s)]
*  She was one of the first famous ladies [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4839.240000000001s)]
*  to go a little nutty. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4841.56s)]
*  Well, see that's how they frame it. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4843.0s)]
*  Oh, I remember that one time that happened. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4844.64s)]
*  But actually a bunch of these people are like that. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4847.04s)]
*  And they're smart enough not to jump around [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4849.4400000000005s)]
*  on a couch like Tom Cruise. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4851.4800000000005s)]
*  They're smart enough not to do that. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4852.8s)]
*  Such as Nelson Rockefeller. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4854.360000000001s)]
*  So, dude, if you wanna get power, okay? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4856.56s)]
*  It's not that you believe necessarily in anything. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4860.04s)]
*  But what's the thing that might get me power? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4863.200000000001s)]
*  And I'll do anything. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4865.4800000000005s)]
*  She claims to have lived a past life [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4867.0s)]
*  in Atlantis two million years ago. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4869.400000000001s)]
*  Well, so she dates in at two million. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4871.6s)]
*  She says she experienced memories of this past life [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4873.44s)]
*  while filming the 2016 movie Wild Oats [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4876.24s)]
*  in the Canary Islands. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4879.28s)]
*  MacLean wrote about her experiences in her 2016 memoir [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4880.32s)]
*  Above the Line, My Wild Oats Adventure. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4883.32s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4885.799999999999s)]
*  Was she banging? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4886.639999999999s)]
*  Was she on a sex store? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4887.48s)]
*  Is that what that means? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4888.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4889.48s)]
*  While sewing your wild oats as a sex store. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4890.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you know actresses, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4892.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4894.04s)]
*  Like how many of them are out of their fucking minds? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4894.879999999999s)]
*  So like this is not shocking [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4897.4s)]
*  that someone would say they lived in Atlantis [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4898.759999999999s)]
*  two million years ago. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4900.299999999999s)]
*  Like two million years ago we weren't even people. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4901.139999999999s)]
*  Well, first of all, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4904.3s)]
*  We weren't people. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4905.26s)]
*  That's not how she remembers it, number one. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4906.1s)]
*  Right, but we know that, right? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4907.5s)]
*  So this is why she's just a cook. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4909.1s)]
*  Well, Shirley MacLean says something different. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4910.78s)]
*  She had a dream. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4912.22s)]
*  She had a very vivid dream. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4913.06s)]
*  Okay, so actors, as you know, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4914.46s)]
*  can, especially like method acting you hear about. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4916.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4919.18s)]
*  Where they go in character and they're gone, right? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4920.02s)]
*  So how do you develop a talent like that? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4922.72s)]
*  You have to be able to dissociate out of your fucking body. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4924.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, for sure. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4926.9800000000005s)]
*  So that's how you get those kind of memories. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4928.3s)]
*  Well, you probably have a detached connection to reality [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4930.42s)]
*  when you're a really good actor. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4933.02s)]
*  Because you're so good at like becoming this other person. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4934.620000000001s)]
*  It's almost like you're throwing yourself into another body, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4937.9400000000005s)]
*  another soul, another life. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4940.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you'll see people like that are religious, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4942.14s)]
*  make it like they're possessed by a thing. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4944.620000000001s)]
*  But I'm like, I don't see really a big difference. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4946.22s)]
*  They get possessed by a character. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4948.02s)]
*  Like Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4949.26s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4951.38s)]
*  That guy is possessed by that character. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4952.22s)]
*  Like I bet he created a past for that guy. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4954.06s)]
*  Of course. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4957.02s)]
*  And had like moments that he- [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4957.860000000001s)]
*  He was cobbling shoes and thinking through [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4958.700000000001s)]
*  the fucking There Will Be Blood guy. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4960.5s)]
*  Yeah, but so that's what a lot of stuff is, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4963.02s)]
*  is like you just take the power of that. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4965.82s)]
*  I know, but you went on a long, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4967.900000000001s)]
*  securitous route from Zechariah Sitchin. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4969.26s)]
*  Oh, so yeah. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4971.7s)]
*  And I want to go back to the Zechariah Sitchin thing [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4972.54s)]
*  because you know, I had that guy Wesley Huff, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4973.7s)]
*  who's a Bible scholar on the part. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4976.06s)]
*  Yeah, I saw it. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4977.22s)]
*  Very interesting guy. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4978.06s)]
*  Yes, I think he is. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4979.34s)]
*  Very, very intelligent guy. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4980.18s)]
*  He doesn't believe that Sitchin could really read Sumerian. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4981.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, I was gonna add, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4985.02s)]
*  you were telling me that no one can read Sumerian. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4985.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, this is what he was saying. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4988.06s)]
*  And this is a guy that speaks and knows many languages [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4989.18s)]
*  and is a legitimate expert in ancient Bible texts. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4992.740000000001s)]
*  In Aramaic, he was explaining the difference [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4996.3s)]
*  between Arcadian and Sumerian and Cuneiform. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=4999.22s)]
*  He's a legitimate language expert. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5003.14s)]
*  And he said, I learned all these other languages, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5005.14s)]
*  but Sumerian was so hard. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5007.1s)]
*  It just doesn't work. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5008.700000000001s)]
*  I just couldn't figure it out. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5010.14s)]
*  And he said, I don't think that Zechariah Sitchin [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5011.54s)]
*  could read it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5013.780000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of people say they could read it [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5014.62s)]
*  and they're lying. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5016.3s)]
*  He says, I think there's very few people [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5017.14s)]
*  that can actually read Sumerian text. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5019.7s)]
*  Who can? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5021.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5022.58s)]
*  I'd like to ask him who can do it. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5024.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's courses you can take, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5025.78s)]
*  but he says it's insane to grasp [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5028.62s)]
*  because it's not connected to any other languages. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5030.62s)]
*  He's like, there's a lot of these languages [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5032.98s)]
*  that are similar to other languages [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5034.46s)]
*  and you can find patterns in them. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5036.299999999999s)]
*  He's like, it's so nuts. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5038.0599999999995s)]
*  It's so, when even we're getting a translation [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5039.82s)]
*  of the Epic of Gilgamesh, right? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5043.5s)]
*  Which was in, I think that was in Arcadian, right? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5045.099999999999s)]
*  Arcadian, brother? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5049.78s)]
*  That's before Sumerian or after? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5051.78s)]
*  After they conquered Sumer and their languages [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5053.0599999999995s)]
*  sort of intertwined, he explained. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5056.259999999999s)]
*  But who the fuck knows? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5059.179999999999s)]
*  No one even knows what Ayo's words sounded like. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5062.46s)]
*  No one can say it out loud, which is so nuts. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5064.98s)]
*  That language is so gone that you can't say it out loud. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5068.74s)]
*  So when someone like Zechariah Sitchin comes along [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5071.94s)]
*  and he has detailed explanations [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5073.94s)]
*  for all the things that happened [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5076.259999999999s)]
*  and that this planet called Nibiru [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5079.34s)]
*  had these beings called the Anunnaki who come to Earth [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5081.54s)]
*  and they genetically engineer humans [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5084.34s)]
*  and they knew about our solar system and all this. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5086.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know how he's getting that [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5088.38s)]
*  because other people aren't getting the same thing. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5090.18s)]
*  And there's a website called sitchiniswrong.com [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5092.099999999999s)]
*  and so I don't even know if this guy's right. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5095.58s)]
*  This is the problem. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5097.14s)]
*  I think this stuff is so weird. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5098.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5100.38s)]
*  The earliest versions of the origin story of humanity [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5101.22s)]
*  are so weird that I don't think anybody [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5105.3s)]
*  totally understands how to interpret them properly. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5108.379999999999s)]
*  I think there is lots of little groups [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5111.179999999999s)]
*  that think that they have the ancient knowledge of it [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5113.82s)]
*  and it's almost like a Scientology Xenu scam. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5116.5s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5119.459999999999s)]
*  You know, what do you call it? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5120.299999999999s)]
*  Mystery school, that's the ancient. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5121.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5123.66s)]
*  So all that is is a religion where I don't tell you [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5124.5s)]
*  what the belief is until you're in too deep [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5126.5s)]
*  to not believe it. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5128.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5130.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like that little bit going clear. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5130.86s)]
*  When the writer, was it Paul Haggis? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5131.98s)]
*  When he gets to the top levels [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5134.0199999999995s)]
*  and then he reads the fucking handwritten notes. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5135.5s)]
*  He's like, what kind of horse shit? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5138.34s)]
*  Dude, so how I got into looking into that shit was, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5139.66s)]
*  I was like, okay, really wealthy people. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5142.18s)]
*  I don't mean, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5144.3s)]
*  I don't think Elon's the richest man in the world. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5145.139999999999s)]
*  I mean like the real, like trillionaires. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5146.9s)]
*  Like what's their, what is their Scientology [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5149.3s)]
*  that they're into? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5151.7s)]
*  I just want to know that. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5152.54s)]
*  And it's very similar. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5153.82s)]
*  Like Scientology is almost a knockoff light version [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5155.099999999999s)]
*  of the real thing. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5157.66s)]
*  So they make it like, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5158.9s)]
*  oh, it's this most sophisticated brainwashing. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5159.74s)]
*  No one ate, it's just one of many. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5162.22s)]
*  It's just one of many. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5164.46s)]
*  Well, I think for a lot of people, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5165.66s)]
*  it helps them become successful. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5168.5s)]
*  I think having a religious framework [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5169.5s)]
*  helps you become successful. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5171.62s)]
*  I think it's one of the keys to like these Dagestan fighters [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5172.78s)]
*  in the UFC. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5175.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5176.78s)]
*  Yeah, they're so religious and devout [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5177.62s)]
*  that they're so disciplined [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5179.3s)]
*  that they don't deviate from the path at all. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5180.9s)]
*  And because of that, they just keep winning. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5183.62s)]
*  Yeah, so my question is, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5185.0199999999995s)]
*  who gave these priests back in the day, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5186.22s)]
*  the sheet of code, of pass codes [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5188.18s)]
*  of one weird trick to get in her pants? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5190.94s)]
*  That's some kind of ancient knowledge [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5194.74s)]
*  that these motherfuckers have. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5196.38s)]
*  And oh, I'll tell you another great channel [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5197.9800000000005s)]
*  is Windows on the World, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5199.82s)]
*  because this dude was talking, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5201.3s)]
*  you know Wallace Budge, the guy that supposedly, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5202.62s)]
*  Indiana Jones, I guess, is supposed to be based on? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5205.02s)]
*  No. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5206.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, well he wrote a, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5207.74s)]
*  Malice has the book. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5208.58s)]
*  It's Egyptian black magic or something. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5209.54s)]
*  It's all about crowd control. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5213.38s)]
*  And so all the pharaoh headdress, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5215.22s)]
*  all that ridiculous shit they wear, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5216.9400000000005s)]
*  there's a bunch of priests that are inbreeding. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5218.34s)]
*  It's almost like Dune. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5221.5s)]
*  In Dune, the Bene Gesserits were breeding [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5222.38s)]
*  the fucking people. Right, right, right. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5224.22s)]
*  That's that. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5225.98s)]
*  And then you spend your whole day [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5226.82s)]
*  preparing for your death as the pharaoh. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5228.46s)]
*  And if you actually read the Book of the Dead, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5230.299999999999s)]
*  it's like, it's out of Three Amigos. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5232.54s)]
*  It's like, then the burning bush [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5234.7s)]
*  and you shoot your gun in the air. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5236.219999999999s)]
*  Remember Three Amigos? [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5237.54s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5239.259999999999s)]
*  It's busy work. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5240.46s)]
*  And so you got an OCD culture now [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5241.9s)]
*  that you gotta, I have to do this and this and this [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5244.74s)]
*  and this for when I get to the cross the river, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5246.5s)]
*  Nile and the crocodile man asked me the three questions. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5249.74s)]
*  They would just do this pointless homework, okay? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5253.26s)]
*  And the priest controlled that. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5256.18s)]
*  So I wanna know where the priest got [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5257.900000000001s)]
*  the method of control from, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5259.740000000001s)]
*  because I think that's what the big secret is [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5261.18s)]
*  that the Templars got is how to control crowds. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5263.66s)]
*  And I think that, because it's so obvious, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5266.9400000000005s)]
*  like all the sports is that. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5268.860000000001s)]
*  Everything is a little pattern thing [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5270.7s)]
*  to like just keep you on the wheel of Samara forever. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5272.860000000001s)]
*  That does make sense if you're talking about [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5276.9400000000005s)]
*  like the Egyptian story of like going into the afterlife [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5278.780000000001s)]
*  and all that stuff, like they have it all mapped out. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5282.82s)]
*  We got all the information, relax, go to work. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5284.46s)]
*  Yeah, and then meanwhile, the priest, right? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5287.86s)]
*  And then so this guy had a great, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5289.34s)]
*  I think his name is Mark Windows. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5292.54s)]
*  Anyway, he had a great, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5294.0599999999995s)]
*  something he said I thought about a lot, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5296.7s)]
*  which is Akhenaten. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5298.259999999999s)]
*  So Akhenaten, when he introduced monotheism, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5300.66s)]
*  here's a way you can look at it. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5303.66s)]
*  The industry of all these gods of polytheism [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5305.46s)]
*  had gotten so bloated, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5308.62s)]
*  like the government had gotten bloated of priests [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5310.299999999999s)]
*  where you're worshiping every little rock, right? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5313.74s)]
*  And he was like, hey, look, we know there's the main god. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5315.219999999999s)]
*  He's like trying to cut government down. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5318.66s)]
*  That was his big crime that they buried him backwards. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5321.7s)]
*  And his weird shaped head, yeah, he could be alien, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5324.62s)]
*  or they could have inbred him like a Habsburg. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5326.9s)]
*  I don't know if you know what happens, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5329.3s)]
*  but people start to look like fucking aliens [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5330.3s)]
*  after you inbrede them enough, you know? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5332.139999999999s)]
*  And then you tie their skull up [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5334.54s)]
*  or whatever the fucking weird shit. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5335.74s)]
*  So I think his big crime was crossing the deep state [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5337.66s)]
*  of his time, kind of. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5340.62s)]
*  I kind of think that, but I think that what I want to know [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5343.46s)]
*  is who are these people that have, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5345.34s)]
*  they know the weird trick to do this and that, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5347.82s)]
*  and they think that they're entitled to do it all the time. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5350.34s)]
*  Like, what is that religion? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5352.5s)]
*  Well, I think anybody that's in power [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5353.78s)]
*  thinks they should stay in power. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5355.86s)]
*  Like a mayor that's getting voted out, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5357.66s)]
*  they think they should stay in power. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5360.099999999999s)]
*  Everybody who's in power wants to stay in power [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5361.74s)]
*  because that's the game. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5363.66s)]
*  The game is to get to the top. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5365.26s)]
*  The game is to get to the top where you're the one [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5366.58s)]
*  who gets it, ladies and gentlemen, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5369.0599999999995s)]
*  the mayor of Dallas, Texas, Bob Smith. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5370.46s)]
*  And he gets up there and says hi to everybody. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5373.14s)]
*  It's the mayor, it's our mayor. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5375.14s)]
*  He wants to stay that guy. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5376.9s)]
*  The Koreans call it squid games, Joe. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5378.34s)]
*  I told you about hot tour coin. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5380.26s)]
*  But that's what it is, it's just a normal thing. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5385.14s)]
*  And once you're in power, you want to stay in power. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5387.1s)]
*  And that's what we saw during this whole election, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5388.94s)]
*  was that the people that were in power, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5391.78s)]
*  we got to see, it wasn't even the guy. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5393.3s)]
*  We thought it was the guy. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5395.9800000000005s)]
*  We thought the guy wants to get in power, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5397.26s)]
*  so he's got the staff. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5398.86s)]
*  People are like, that's okay. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5400.46s)]
*  It wasn't even the guy. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5401.299999999999s)]
*  It was the people around the guy [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5402.5s)]
*  that we didn't vote for. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5403.94s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5405.099999999999s)]
*  If you're like a more sophisticated NPR type [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5406.219999999999s)]
*  fucking loyal Democrat, that's the kind of people [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5409.46s)]
*  that know that and think it's good. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5412.179999999999s)]
*  Like no, it's who he has around him that really counts. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5414.54s)]
*  Oh, the ones I didn't vote for? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5417.259999999999s)]
*  It's so crazy to say that a giant group of people [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5419.179999999999s)]
*  that can easily be manipulated behind the scenes [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5423.139999999999s)]
*  are now in control of everything, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5425.94s)]
*  and they just slide executive orders [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5427.74s)]
*  into the front of this senile man [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5430.7s)]
*  who was deemed not fit to stand for trial. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5432.58s)]
*  Well, that's where the problem with running [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5435.74s)]
*  a pyramid scheme is you're recruiting [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5437.099999999999s)]
*  narcissists, sociopaths, the people that really succeed. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5439.94s)]
*  By the way, every time you talk about Hoctua coin, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5443.42s)]
*  is that what you meant? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5445.86s)]
*  Well, what I like about Hoctua coin, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5446.74s)]
*  is that a veiled reference to Maga coin? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5447.58s)]
*  Hoctua coin is strictly for Sigma grindset alphas. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5449.9s)]
*  What about Melania coin? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5455.38s)]
*  Yeah, coffee? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5457.139999999999s)]
*  Dude, how would my get some? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5458.34s)]
*  How much do you think, cheers sir, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5461.780000000001s)]
*  how much do you think Melania coin's going for these days? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5463.62s)]
*  Probably a lot. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5466.22s)]
*  Yo, if Trump keeps promises, I'll bet the coin will go up. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5467.06s)]
*  This is the way they'll compromise me. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5470.54s)]
*  They'll come to me with a JRE coin idea, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5471.820000000001s)]
*  and they'll explain to me. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5474.22s)]
*  There's still NFTs out there, dude. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5475.5s)]
*  That was the best one. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5477.9800000000005s)]
*  That one was like, you can't do it. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5479.34s)]
*  You can't explain it to me in a way that makes sense. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5482.1s)]
*  The only thing that makes sense is Beeple, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5484.46s)]
*  because that's an NFT, but it's actually digital art. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5486.18s)]
*  Beeple? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5488.38s)]
*  That guy, the guy who made the Giga Chad, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5489.22s)]
*  the Elon Musk that's jacked. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5490.660000000001s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5493.660000000001s)]
*  Never. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5494.5s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5495.34s)]
*  We should probably have that on the desk again. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5496.18s)]
*  Was it distracting? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5497.1s)]
*  Is that why we took it off the desk? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5498.58s)]
*  Never, it's only ever been here. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5499.660000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5501.62s)]
*  I thought we had it on the desk unplugged [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5502.46s)]
*  when he gave it to us. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5505.02s)]
*  Maybe, yeah. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5505.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're right, it never was on the desk. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5507.740000000001s)]
*  But also, that's the Shibu Inu. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5509.1s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5511.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5512.38s)]
*  Wow, so. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5513.22s)]
*  That Shibu Inu coin is, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5514.06s)]
*  how much is that worth right now? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5514.98s)]
*  This is what we were talking about before, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5516.5s)]
*  that if you put $1,000 into it when you started, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5518.0199999999995s)]
*  it's worth a shitload of money now. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5521.62s)]
*  And I'm like, is that real money, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5524.299999999999s)]
*  or is that like Dogecoin and this coin [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5525.82s)]
*  and fucking meme coin? [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5528.86s)]
*  It's all magic, Joe. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5529.7s)]
*  Right, but that's what I'm saying. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5530.82s)]
*  Is the $36 billion that bought the Trump coin, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5532.0599999999995s)]
*  is that real money? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5534.98s)]
*  Or is that a bunch of, did you sell Shibu Inu coin [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5536.58s)]
*  to buy the Trump coin? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5540.74s)]
*  Did you trade it in Trump? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5542.46s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5544.1s)]
*  Is that? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5545.1s)]
*  If you believe it. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5545.9400000000005s)]

*  Well, if you do, I mean, look. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5547.6s)]
*  But is that ultimately good? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5549.06s)]
*  Is it ultimately good to have cryptocurrencies [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5550.58s)]
*  that no one's in control of? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5553.34s)]
*  Maybe they're all volatile and crazy [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5555.14s)]
*  and moving all over the place, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5556.780000000001s)]
*  but it's not a central bank [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5557.620000000001s)]
*  that's dictating the interest rates [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5559.26s)]
*  and telling you what you can do. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5561.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5562.5s)]
*  It's not something called. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5563.34s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you this. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5564.18s)]
*  How can I check to see that it's not controlled? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5565.02s)]
*  Look at these giant spikes [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5567.900000000001s)]
*  where people just fucking cash out. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5569.22s)]
*  2021? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5571.22s)]
*  So 2021, it was worth how much? [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5572.26s)]
*  A lot more than it is now. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5574.58s)]
*  $7? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5575.42s)]
*  Where's Hawk2A? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5576.259999999999s)]
*  We check Hawk2A? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5577.099999999999s)]
*  That's a 24 hour volume. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5577.94s)]
*  There was $8 billion traded that day. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5579.42s)]
*  Okay, so what is it worth at that time? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5581.94s)]
*  I mean, it's 0.0000645 cents. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5584.78s)]
*  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5589.42s)]
*  So why did I read that thing about people [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5591.219999999999s)]
*  that you bought at a certain point in time? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5594.38s)]
*  If you bought here, which was January of last year. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5596.299999999999s)]
*  No, I think they were saying if you bought at the beginning. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5599.299999999999s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5601.38s)]
*  It just depends on what day you buy. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5602.219999999999s)]
*  If you bought this date, you're fucked. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5603.839999999999s)]
*  So if you bought, but if you bought $1000 worth [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5605.48s)]
*  at the beginning, what's that worth now? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5608.32s)]
*  Can you calculate that? [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5611.08s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5612.0s)]
*  It's seven, I don't know. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5612.839999999999s)]
*  It's a lot. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5615.36s)]
*  It's, the point was in this stupid thing [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5616.2s)]
*  was they were just talking about the volatility [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5619.5599999999995s)]
*  of these meme coins, how crazy it is. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5621.66s)]
*  And that some of them actually proved to be profitable. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5623.839999999999s)]
*  And so the question is, we have so many of them already. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5626.219999999999s)]
*  What's to stop people from doing it? [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5630.12s)]
*  Is it, I could see someone saying it's unbecoming [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5633.56s)]
*  for a president to make a big money grab [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5636.04s)]
*  and start a meme coin. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5638.04s)]
*  That I could see. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5639.68s)]
*  I see that argument. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5640.52s)]
*  But my question is, who's allowed to make them? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5641.4800000000005s)]
*  If you have a Shibu Inu coin and a Doge coin, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5645.5s)]
*  you know, a Hakuto coin, how many of them are there? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5647.76s)]
*  Let's find that out. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5650.32s)]
*  How many meme coins are there out there? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5651.16s)]
*  And what's the rules? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5653.2s)]
*  Like who, I'm not saying that anybody should [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5654.92s)]
*  or shouldn't be doing this. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5658.2s)]
*  I wanna be real clear. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5659.28s)]
*  What I'm saying, what is going on here? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5660.36s)]
*  How easy is it to make one of these things? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5662.799999999999s)]
*  And can anybody do that? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5665.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5666.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5667.2s)]
*  Anybody can do that. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5668.04s)]
*  So isn't that fucking weird? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5668.88s)]
*  And is that weird and bad? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5670.679999999999s)]
*  Or is it weird and different? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5672.599999999999s)]
*  Or is it better than having a central bank [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5674.259999999999s)]
*  that's controlled by something that's supposed [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5677.16s)]
*  to be the Federal Reserve, but it's not Federal? [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5679.48s)]
*  Okay, so you brought up gold, right? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5681.28s)]
*  So here's the phases of magic. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5683.16s)]
*  First, gold is alchemy, and then dollars, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5685.28s)]
*  which is central magic, and now conjuration, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5687.799999999999s)]
*  where we conjure it out of nothing. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5690.32s)]
*  Right, you can make a coin. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5692.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you're the president, you can make a coin. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5694.24s)]
*  You make $36 billion off that coin in a day or two, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5696.04s)]
*  or it's worth, or it was, and it went up and down. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5699.799999999999s)]
*  That's where it gets real tough, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5702.2s)]
*  because he can't cash out. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5703.28s)]
*  If he cashed out, it would fall apart. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5704.799999999999s)]
*  But couldn't you use that money that's in that account [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5706.5599999999995s)]
*  to get loans off of his stuff? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5708.66s)]
*  You'd have to use it that day, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5710.46s)]
*  while it's still that valuable, [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5711.44s)]
*  and no one, you know, a smart person wouldn't do that. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5713.24s)]
*  But imagine if you have Trump coin. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5715.759999999999s)]
*  Let's imagine, I'm not saying that anyone's doing this, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5717.12s)]
*  let's say we do a JRE coin, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5719.839999999999s)]
*  and the JRE coin is worth $3 billion, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5721.5599999999995s)]
*  and we decide, okay, we're gonna take some of that money, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5724.639999999999s)]
*  and not sell the coin, but use it as collateral for a loan [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5728.679999999999s)]
*  to build a $2 million new studio. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5732.679999999999s)]
*  Not for that, but essentially, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5735.44s)]
*  that's what the projects are supposed to be for. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5737.12s)]
*  They're launching a coin almost as a fundraiser, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5739.08s)]
*  as a new way to be like a stock. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5741.2s)]
*  But it's just not, it's not a stock. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5743.92s)]
*  That's what Trump, that's what they're saying. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5745.719999999999s)]
*  Okay, well that makes sense. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5748.12s)]
*  Everybody's got their own plans. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5749.56s)]
*  That does make sense, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5750.4s)]
*  because then you're essentially crowdfunding [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5751.24s)]
*  the organization, and as long as he's not selling the coins, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5753.68s)]
*  the question is like, when does it become a problem? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5758.12s)]
*  Like, first of all, no one's making you buy into this, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5761.02s)]
*  so it is what you say, it's legal gambling. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5764.36s)]
*  Because you're putting money in, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5766.36s)]
*  thinking you're gonna get more money. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5768.4s)]
*  Okay, so you think it's, you're gonna be able to find [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5769.84s)]
*  a moment where you're gonna cash out, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5771.8s)]
*  and I know a guy who got fucked doing that, [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5773.4800000000005s)]
*  where his guy sold it at the wrong time, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5776.08s)]
*  and he lost a shitload of money. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5777.68s)]
*  Oh, I think he's gonna say he got cheated [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5779.200000000001s)]
*  by the coin wallet, he was inventing. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5781.200000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, he got fucked, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5783.280000000001s)]
*  because he was trying to cash out, and he missed it. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5784.68s)]
*  Look, you're just not backed up. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5787.92s)]
*  If something goes wrong, you don't have the backup [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5789.08s)]
*  that you supposedly have with the other one. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5791.200000000001s)]
*  That's, to me, the main thing. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5792.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you're gonna be part [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5794.4800000000005s)]
*  of the new Technocracy Inc. energy currency. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5797.12s)]
*  You know Technocracy Inc., the Canadian, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5800.76s)]
*  Techno, where the guys wear gray suits, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5803.72s)]
*  and the whole thing was you're gonna have [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5805.56s)]
*  energy credits, you always hear, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5808.360000000001s)]
*  and it splintered into a lot of things. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5810.240000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5812.040000000001s)]
*  You know, that's the one Elon's grandpa was in, [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5812.88s)]
*  where they gave people number names that sound like, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5814.4800000000005s)]
*  let me say, can't name numbers. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5817.320000000001s)]
*  XH, they would do that. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5820.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5821.52s)]
*  But his grandfather left the guys, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5822.68s)]
*  the guy was like kind of a phony and a loser, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5825.360000000001s)]
*  the main face man of it. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5827.200000000001s)]
*  But you still hear Techno, the Technate, you heard of that? [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5830.8s)]
*  No, but isn't that a weird thing about people, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5834.88s)]
*  is that there's always, always, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5837.64s)]
*  in every fucking stretch of the Earth, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5841.5599999999995s)]
*  someone figures out a system where there's a group [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5843.84s)]
*  of rules and laws, and there's gods, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5847.4s)]
*  and it controls people. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5850.2s)]
*  You know why? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5851.04s)]
*  Because human nature is not good or bad, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5851.88s)]
*  it's programmability, and so the first guy [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5854.0s)]
*  to figure that out is the guy that got [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5857.36s)]
*  to be the first priest, I bet. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5859.12s)]
*  And maybe he didn't figure it out, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5861.08s)]
*  maybe somebody told him. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5861.96s)]
*  Well, that's how you turn someone into a soldier. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5862.8s)]
*  That's how you turn them into whatever you need. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5864.84s)]
*  That's why we have the Prussian school of school. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5866.24s)]
*  The teachers aren't there to know, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5868.719999999999s)]
*  you're like, oh, these teachers can't even pass [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5870.76s)]
*  an English test and they teach English. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5872.88s)]
*  Well, just so you know, the system was set up [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5874.719999999999s)]
*  not for them to know shit. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5876.679999999999s)]
*  The system was set up with psychological things. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5878.12s)]
*  So whatever rich guy is in charge that week, [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5880.44s)]
*  that's the psych, so remember Common Core, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5883.24s)]
*  that everybody, all the liberals complained [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5885.24s)]
*  about Common Core. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5886.96s)]
*  I don't have kids, so I didn't know how bad it was. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5888.32s)]
*  But that's the Bill and Melinda Gates [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5890.84s)]
*  are gonna be educating you now foundation's fucking thing. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5892.92s)]
*  It's all psychology. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5896.72s)]
*  They don't give a shit if you learn anything. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5898.0s)]
*  They give a shit if you're gonna be a problem. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5900.0s)]
*  And the reason I know is they wrote it down openly. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5902.8s)]
*  John Taylor got all his books about education. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5905.64s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5908.64s)]
*  If you thought the Fauci book was interesting, wow. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5910.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5913.28s)]
*  Yeah, John Taylor got, he wrote a good essay [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5914.12s)]
*  called Against School. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5915.84s)]
*  And so the history of it, see people die, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5917.44s)]
*  people get old and die out. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5920.32s)]
*  You got a new generation of suckers born [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5921.4s)]
*  that don't even remember, right? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5923.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5924.76s)]
*  There were people shooting at the feds [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5926.120000000001s)]
*  when they instituted public school. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5927.84s)]
*  The whole idea of having someone like Rockefeller [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5929.88s)]
*  figure out the education system is so wild. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5932.72s)]
*  Carnegie helped, don't think it was an autocracy. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5934.88s)]
*  Right, there was a few people involved. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5937.68s)]
*  A bunch of plutocrats. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5939.240000000001s)]
*  They had a design, they had a design. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5940.6s)]
*  And that design could have been different, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5942.88s)]
*  and who knows what we'd be like if it was. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5944.280000000001s)]
*  But here's the other thing, I think there's some aspect [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5946.76s)]
*  of school forcing you to sit in those classes, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5949.0s)]
*  forcing you to pay attention. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5952.240000000001s)]
*  But there's some aspect of that that really gives you [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5954.36s)]
*  the motivation to not live that life. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5957.599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's how I felt. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5960.719999999999s)]
*  That's how I felt. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5961.679999999999s)]
*  I went in, when I went to school I already could read. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5962.639999999999s)]
*  And so I was more fully, how you describe that thing? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5965.5199999999995s)]
*  Now I was still pretty, I remember crying [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5969.16s)]
*  because I couldn't get in line, I didn't know the deal. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5971.719999999999s)]
*  But don't you think that's what makes musicians, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5973.5599999999995s)]
*  comics, artists, that's what makes, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5975.96s)]
*  it's like the resistance to want to be in that world. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5977.44s)]
*  Oh, you know what I think it is? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5979.799999999999s)]
*  It's like, you know when they say how flogras made, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5980.639999999999s)]
*  it's only bad flogras made this way, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5983.36s)]
*  but all the geese are like this, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5985.04s)]
*  and they're just force feeding poison into them [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5986.88s)]
*  to make their liver soft. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5988.82s)]
*  And that's what we- [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5990.599999999999s)]
*  It's just grain, they're giving them grain [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5991.44s)]
*  so they overeat. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5993.16s)]
*  That was a, it's not how good flogras made at all, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5994.759999999999s)]
*  they treat them well, or it wouldn't be good. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5997.16s)]
*  Do you know, okay, but do you know that the ducks [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=5998.92s)]
*  actually walk over to the feeder? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6001.679999999999s)]
*  Do you know that they gravitate, they want that to happen? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6004.88s)]
*  Well, what I'm saying is- [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6007.639999999999s)]
*  It's gross that they do it the way they do it, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6009.16s)]
*  they jam it, but the ducks want it to happen. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6010.96s)]
*  Oh, I know, but look, I'm just saying that- [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6012.52s)]
*  You know what, Bourdain told me that, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6015.68s)]
*  I'm like, no way, he showed me a video. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6017.360000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6018.96s)]
*  Dude, Village Voice had an article years ago about it, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6019.8s)]
*  and the guy was like, look, if it was different, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6021.160000000001s)]
*  I'd tell you, but I'm telling you what I just saw. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6022.72s)]
*  But we're not in that good system, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6025.0s)]
*  we're the ones from the story like this, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6026.88s)]
*  and they force poisons in you, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6029.160000000001s)]
*  and then sometimes you lay golden eggs, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6031.080000000001s)]
*  and that's what it is. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6033.56s)]
*  You're a medium, you're big, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6035.160000000001s)]
*  like a water balloon filled with blood, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6037.52s)]
*  but you know how you make snake venom, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6040.0s)]
*  they bite the horse and they use the horse's hormones? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6041.84s)]
*  Well, people are good, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6044.679999999999s)]
*  that's how we probably invented medicine, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6045.5199999999995s)]
*  was using people with venom, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6047.48s)]
*  and then taking their fluids [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6049.28s)]
*  and making drugs out of it and shit. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6050.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you never heard of this? [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6054.28s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6055.96s)]
*  How medicine was invented? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6056.96s)]
*  Well, it was mostly, the Rockefeller method [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6058.5199999999995s)]
*  was they were using oil, right? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6061.88s)]
*  Wasn't that like he converted pharmaceutical drugs [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6064.84s)]
*  to a petroleum-based production? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6067.759999999999s)]
*  I got a little gold in it. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6069.599999999999s)]
*  Wasn't that like under his direction? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6070.639999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, no, that's, dude, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6073.799999999999s)]
*  these eugenics didn't come from the Nazis, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6075.36s)]
*  it came from us, it came from our billionaires, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6077.32s)]
*  and they're real into it. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6080.32s)]
*  Right now, RFK Jr. is having his hearings. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6081.599999999999s)]
*  Oh dude, he's interfering, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6085.16s)]
*  again, New World Order, not Alex Jones, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6087.04s)]
*  that's the thing they said openly, Bill Clinton said it. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6088.839999999999s)]
*  You could tell who the whole gang is [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6092.2s)]
*  because they all said it. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6093.879999999999s)]
*  Then they change it to the rules-based international order. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6095.24s)]
*  Every stupid parrot phrase, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6099.28s)]
*  I can never get out of my head now. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6101.639999999999s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6103.24s)]
*  Like going back, Iraq, the terrorists go [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6104.08s)]
*  to the sound of the guns. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6106.599999999999s)]
*  That fucking shit about why Iraq was a good idea, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6108.32s)]
*  because instead of attacking us, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6110.879999999999s)]

*  And you hear it three times and now it's a fact. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6116.839999999999s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6118.96s)]
*  Democracy's on the ballot, democracy's on the ballot, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6120.679999999999s)]
*  democracy's on the ballot, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6123.719999999999s)]
*  and then if I've been pre-primed properly, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6124.879999999999s)]
*  with some good MK retard programming, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6128.5199999999995s)]
*  and I hear democracy on the ballot, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6132.2s)]
*  I react differently than your old people [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6133.44s)]
*  that still watch CNN who are just like, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6136.12s)]
*  I heard democracy's on the ballot. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6137.5599999999995s)]
*  I might be triggered to go Sirhan Sirhan. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6139.32s)]
*  Remember all those guys that went to kill Trump? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6141.919999999999s)]
*  Remember how weird they were? [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6143.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6145.08s)]
*  The guy with two different color hair. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6145.919999999999s)]
*  Well, the first guy's the weird one, [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6147.28s)]
*  because the first guy had five phones. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6149.12s)]
*  His house was professionally scrubbed, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6152.48s)]
*  there was no silverware in his house. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6154.2s)]
*  He had no online social media profile [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6156.08s)]
*  and he was 20 years old. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6159.36s)]
*  And he was in a BlackRock commercial, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6160.2s)]
*  and there was some sort of metadata from a phone [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6162.679999999999s)]
*  that traveled from outside of the FBI offices in DC [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6166.44s)]
*  to him on multiple occasions. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6169.5199999999995s)]
*  Those folks were behavior modification therapists. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6171.24s)]
*  Is that weird? [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6174.879999999999s)]
*  Hey, I mean, I don't wanna tell tales out of school. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6175.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's odd. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6179.5199999999995s)]
*  Good news, it's a girl. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6180.36s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6182.4s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6183.24s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6184.08s)]
*  I mean, that guy was the perfect Lee Harvey Oswald. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6188.32s)]
*  They'd scrubbed his past. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6190.72s)]
*  There was nothing there. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6192.5599999999995s)]
*  But you know how nutty that is if he pulled that off? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6194.16s)]
*  We're in an alternative timeline. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6197.08s)]
*  We're in an alternative timeline. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6199.16s)]
*  Seems like the same old timeline to me. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6200.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6201.4s)]
*  The timeline took two big shifts. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6202.4s)]
*  Mark Andreessen brought this up, [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6204.32s)]
*  and I think he's totally right. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6205.64s)]
*  The first big shift was Elon buying Twitter. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6207.12s)]
*  That was a big shift. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6209.72s)]
*  The second big shift was that bullet missing Trump. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6210.64s)]
*  Those are giant shifts. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6215.04s)]
*  Different timelines. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6216.16s)]
*  Because then he wins. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6217.0s)]
*  And then when he wins, and then now he's trying [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6218.56s)]
*  to figure out what the fuck is going on. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6221.88s)]
*  Look, it was all foretold in the Illuminati card game. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6223.44s)]
*  I don't know if anybody knows about that card game. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6225.84s)]
*  Did you see that thing that I sent you? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6227.68s)]
*  I think I sent you, Jamie, where they were explaining [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6228.5199999999995s)]
*  how this new technology's mapped out 55,000 NGOs. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6230.64s)]
*  Did I show it to you last night? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6236.8s)]
*  Yeah, it looked like the galaxy. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6237.64s)]
*  Ha ha ha! [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6239.5199999999995s)]
*  It looked like! [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6240.84s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6241.68s)]
*  It's like there's a sophisticated non-government organization. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6242.52s)]
*  So that's the shadow government. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6246.56s)]
*  Hey, what are these weird things? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6248.240000000001s)]
*  So the government is funding [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6249.080000000001s)]
*  non-government organizations. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6250.240000000001s)]
*  This is what's nutty. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6252.200000000001s)]
*  So fractal technology maps previously hidden connections [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6253.280000000001s)]
*  between 55,000 liberal NGOs, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6257.160000000001s)]
*  revealing how tax dollars allegedly flow [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6260.240000000001s)]
*  through major institutions like Vanguard and Morgan Stanley [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6262.68s)]
*  to groups like the Chinese Progressive Association. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6266.080000000001s)]
*  This breakthrough tracking system can now monitor [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6269.160000000001s)]
*  every dollar going to every NGO, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6271.72s)]
*  exposing intricate funding webs [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6274.360000000001s)]
*  that traditional tech couldn't detect. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6276.320000000001s)]
*  Example, black voters, matter funds, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6278.52s)]
*  four million dollar distribution network was invisible [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6281.88s)]
*  until quantum mapping revealed [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6284.88s)]
*  dozens of subsidiary organizations. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6287.0s)]
*  The unprecedented mapping reveals a previously hidden web [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6290.0s)]
*  of financial relationships. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6293.72s)]
*  So if you look at this crazy web of financial relationships [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6295.52s)]
*  and what is being done with all this money, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6299.96s)]
*  it's just like shell corporations. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6302.56s)]
*  It's like this convenient way to hide [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6304.32s)]
*  where all the money's coming from. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6307.12s)]
*  And then this was a big part of what you were saying, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6308.72s)]
*  like how much Kamala Harris spent in the 1.5 billion. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6311.36s)]
*  Well, a lot of it was to groups. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6315.88s)]
*  A lot of it was to NGOs. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6317.92s)]
*  Yeah! [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6319.4800000000005s)]
*  Literally. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6320.32s)]
*  Everybody gets their payout. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6321.16s)]
*  The most egregious example, whether it's true or not, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6322.0s)]
*  we haven't been able to substantiate [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6324.84s)]
*  that celebrities were paid to endorse her publicly. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6326.8s)]
*  It just looked like it from their faces [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6329.44s)]
*  and how they performed. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6331.16s)]
*  Well, also, it looked weird. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6332.0s)]
*  The Beyonce thing was weird. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6335.12s)]
*  People thought they were gonna go see Beyonce perform [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6336.12s)]
*  and Beyonce talks for 10 minutes [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6338.0s)]
*  and makes $10 million. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6340.08s)]
*  Hey, have Beyonce and don't have her do the thing. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6341.92s)]
*  Have her tell you her feelings and then leave really quick. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6344.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, have her tell you how to vote without saying. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6346.799999999999s)]
*  But also, it's like, did you really do that? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6348.879999999999s)]
*  Did you really, you want some more? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6351.16s)]
*  Did you really fucking pay someone? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6352.759999999999s)]
*  And is that legal to pay someone to endorse you? [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6355.92s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6360.0s)]
*  It sure is. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6360.84s)]
*  To get a famous person. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6361.679999999999s)]
*  Like, it's one thing you wanna endorse a Toyota. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6362.88s)]
*  It's just my truck. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6366.679999999999s)]
*  I really love these Toyota Tundras. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6368.639999999999s)]
*  They're so reliable. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6370.32s)]
*  It's an awesome car. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6371.4s)]
*  But it's another thing to endorse a political candidate [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6372.4s)]
*  and to be paid for it openly. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6375.0s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6376.92s)]
*  Well, but we're fighting against Trump. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6378.0s)]
*  Don't you understand Trump? [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6380.84s)]
*  50 Cent turned down Donald Trump's $3 million offer [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6382.24s)]
*  to perform at Madison Square Garden Rally. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6385.24s)]
*  He still wants him Chelsea Handler blow jobs still. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6387.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6391.6s)]
*  That's how I read that. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6392.4400000000005s)]
*  So I guess what this is saying [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6393.280000000001s)]
*  is that the Republicans do it as well, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6394.52s)]
*  but this isn't endorsing him. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6395.96s)]
*  This is just performing. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6397.320000000001s)]
*  I hope nobody has party loyalty here [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6399.52s)]
*  because you are a chump if you do. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6402.160000000001s)]
*  You cannot go by the, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6404.160000000001s)]
*  look, we don't even know what a woman is. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6405.76s)]
*  How are you supposed to know what a Republican is? [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6407.400000000001s)]
*  Well, also, that's not like a good audience for 50 Cent. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6408.68s)]
*  To be clear, he said it on a radio show [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6411.6s)]
*  and afterwards, Trump official, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6413.88s)]
*  or people on the campaign said that it was not true. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6415.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, you have to also figure in [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6418.36s)]
*  they might just be saying bullshit. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6420.24s)]
*  Boy, I'm getting sick of that. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6422.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6425.2s)]
*  Well, someone knows the truth. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6426.28s)]
*  There's gotta be paperwork, you know? [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6428.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6430.759999999999s)]
*  There's gotta be paperwork. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6431.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I love the constellation. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6432.719999999999s)]
*  We had to use a quantum computer to figure out how. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6434.639999999999s)]
*  Where'd you see Planet Biden family [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6438.4s)]
*  over in the other quadrant of the. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6440.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6442.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6442.92s)]
*  Of all that money. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6443.759999999999s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6445.12s)]
*  It's so weird that it's legal. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6446.0s)]
*  They just flow money around. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6447.72s)]
*  And I think that's a part of this whole spending freeze, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6448.92s)]
*  right? [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6451.08s)]
*  Isn't that a part of this whole government spending freeze? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6452.04s)]
*  I mean, look, I could believe that it's so out of hand [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6454.4800000000005s)]
*  that you had to invent an AI [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6456.36s)]
*  to figure out how much money's being stolen. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6458.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6460.64s)]
*  I can't believe that, but Richard Grove [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6462.08s)]
*  from Grand Theft World podcast [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6464.16s)]
*  has drawn a map of the connections of, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6465.52s)]
*  and his are like, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6467.56s)]
*  they're not like a cult or something. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6468.84s)]
*  He just did all the research and has a map of it. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6471.44s)]
*  You can see all the little groups. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6475.0s)]
*  They really do multiply like that. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6476.08s)]
*  Like they fractal. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6477.72s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6479.84s)]
*  It's just so wild that there's so many of them. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6481.36s)]
*  They do multiply and it creates this ecosystem [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6483.16s)]
*  of people that are there to support a very specific thing [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6485.68s)]
*  because their livelihood depends on it. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6488.2s)]
*  A pyramid, if you will. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6489.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6490.68s)]
*  And well, this is another thing that, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6491.52s)]
*  did this happen or did someone propose [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6492.64s)]
*  banning federal workers from posting on social media? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6497.28s)]
*  And this was to prevent astroturfing. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6500.84s)]
*  The idea was- [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6503.88s)]
*  They'll get around it. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6505.04s)]
*  But this is the idea. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6506.12s)]
*  The idea is there's no federal funds [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6507.08s)]
*  can be spent paying a federal employee [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6509.28s)]
*  and that federal employee then pushes propaganda. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6512.92s)]
*  Wait, but I thought we have military to do that for us. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6517.16s)]
*  The idea is they're gonna stop political parties [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6520.96s)]
*  from doing that. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6524.16s)]
*  They're gonna say that you can't do that anymore. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6525.24s)]
*  So you can't astroturf. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6527.4400000000005s)]
*  You can't send a bunch, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6530.76s)]
*  you have to hire a bunch of people [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6532.36s)]
*  that send a bunch of things and you're paying them [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6533.92s)]
*  because they do pay social media influencers. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6536.32s)]
*  You think they're gonna, they're gonna- [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6538.48s)]
*  You know that, right? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6539.679999999999s)]
*  Yes! [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6540.639999999999s)]
*  They've offered to pay people to endorse- [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6542.08s)]
*  This comes, when I Google stuff about the Hatch Act, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6544.32s)]
*  keeps popping up. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6547.0s)]
*  In general, all federal employees may use social media [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6548.2s)]
*  and comply with the Hatch Act [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6550.5599999999995s)]
*  if they remember the following three prohibitions, [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6551.88s)]
*  on duty or in the workplace prohibition. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6554.799999999999s)]
*  Employees may not engage in political activity [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6557.04s)]
*  while on duty or in the federal workplace. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6560.0s)]
*  But they can do it when they get at home. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6563.2s)]
*  I think this was something that Trump proposed. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6564.76s)]
*  Oh, well I- So pull that up. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6567.4s)]
*  Yeah, Trump. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6570.12s)]
*  Trump's first order hit workers, [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6573.4s)]
*  construction AG, federal, no. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6575.52s)]
*  See if you find anything on that. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6578.12s)]
*  Because someone was talking about it [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6579.92s)]
*  last night at the club and I said, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6581.08s)]
*  I gotta find out if that's real. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6582.68s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6584.2s)]
*  And they were saying that it was to prevent astroturfing. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6585.2s)]
*  But if you say that federal employees, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6587.96s)]
*  including like Congress people, [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6590.12s)]
*  they can't, AOC can't post on Twitter, that's crazy. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6591.84s)]
*  Get rid of the FISA court. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6596.32s)]
*  Here's some things on the list [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6597.4800000000005s)]
*  that I hope that he's gonna do. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6598.88s)]
*  I hope the FISA court thing, [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6600.2s)]
*  that Tulsi had to be like, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6602.64s)]
*  no, I'm for it now to maybe get appointed. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6604.44s)]
*  And I think they're not buying, she's for it or something. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6607.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6609.36s)]
*  Don't you think that like the solution is that, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6610.36s)]
*  of course, everyone can post on social media? [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6613.68s)]
*  Because you have to be able to explain yourself. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6616.48s)]
*  And to limit someone's ability to explain themselves [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6618.24s)]
*  while they're a federal employee, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6620.719999999999s)]
*  that's a weapon that you could use against somebody. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6622.08s)]
*  So they all have to be able to. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6624.12s)]
*  But they should probably have to only post with their site. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6625.5599999999995s)]
*  That probably should be a law. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6629.4s)]
*  Like they can't have sock puppet accounts. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6630.839999999999s)]
*  They can't have bots. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6633.08s)]
*  They can't hire a bunch of people to post stuff for them. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6634.48s)]
*  That should be the thing. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6637.919999999999s)]
*  If you're in that Smith Modernization Act [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6638.799999999999s)]
*  deployed to do that, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6641.04s)]
*  you're just compartmentalizing it [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6643.2s)]
*  so this one group can't do it. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6644.5599999999995s)]
*  But don't worry, the Intel community is still gonna do it. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6645.76s)]
*  This is the question, should there be a law [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6648.280000000001s)]
*  against hiring a bunch of people [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6650.88s)]
*  to pretend that they're regular people [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6653.280000000001s)]
*  and post stuff for you? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6655.24s)]
*  You know? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6658.2s)]
*  I mean, should there be a law? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6659.04s)]
*  I guess I have to go over it. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6659.88s)]
*  Look, I hate dishonest motherfuckers, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6661.84s)]
*  so my knee-jerk reaction is of course there should be. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6664.12s)]
*  But I'm sure, like with every goddamn thing, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6667.24s)]
*  like when I was really for the Patriot Act [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6670.12s)]
*  because I was such a patriot, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6672.12s)]
*  it turned out it wasn't about patriotism. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6673.92s)]
*  It was about spying on you. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6676.72s)]
*  Right, I found, I don't know, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6678.4400000000005s)]
*  this is nothing about a ban, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6680.08s)]
*  but this is something along the lines of what you're saying. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6681.68s)]
*  To me, about something like this. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6685.6s)]
*  What is it? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6686.84s)]
*  So a subreddit called Fed News found that active worker, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6687.68s)]
*  daily activity on their subreddit [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6692.12s)]
*  is high during the middle of the day. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6694.6s)]
*  Oh, they're working from home, is that what they're saying? [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6696.52s)]
*  All the tax dollars paying federal employees [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6698.400000000001s)]
*  to post on Reddit. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6700.2s)]
*  They'll make them come to the office, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6701.400000000001s)]

*  that this stuff is being revealed now [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6990.5199999999995s)]
*  for the first time in mainstream life. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6992.599999999999s)]
*  Because all throughout history, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6995.719999999999s)]
*  if you were talking like this, [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6997.16s)]
*  if we were in the 80s and you were talking like this, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6998.32s)]
*  you were a fucking crazy person. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=6999.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, here's what's funny. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7001.86s)]
*  The term conspiracy theory, lest we all forget, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7003.759999999999s)]
*  came out of Alan Dulles at the CIA [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7006.5199999999995s)]
*  after they murdered JFK. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7008.919999999999s)]
*  And he told his minions in the press [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7011.12s)]
*  to keep saying conspiracy theory. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7013.24s)]
*  So that's where we got that from the, [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7015.64s)]
*  I mean, that's mind blowing. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7017.88s)]
*  Yeah, and people didn't wanna be labeled a fool, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7019.280000000001s)]
*  so you didn't wanna be labeled a conspiracy theorist. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7021.4800000000005s)]
*  And so it shut down the conversation. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7024.160000000001s)]
*  Well, Diddy should tell that to the judge [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7026.160000000001s)]
*  when he goes in on his Rico. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7027.4400000000005s)]
*  Your Honor, this is just a conspiracy theory. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7029.84s)]
*  How come that's a crime you could be prosecuted for? [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7031.72s)]
*  I call it a collusion theory. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7034.04s)]
*  Remember they started saying collusion [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7036.200000000001s)]
*  because they burned the word conspiracy. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7037.76s)]
*  So they had to say Trump, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7039.92s)]
*  because what you're accusing of is conspiring with Russia, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7041.0s)]
*  but they had to keep saying collusion [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7043.88s)]
*  because they made that term suck for intel purposes. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7045.6s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7048.4400000000005s)]
*  And every time they change the brand name, so UAP, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7049.4800000000005s)]
*  it's because they go in the water, we have to change it. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7053.28s)]
*  Do you? [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7055.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7057.16s)]
*  No, it was the word got muddy. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7058.0s)]
*  Yeah, the word got muddy. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7063.400000000001s)]
*  Who muddied the word by the way again? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7064.72s)]
*  Refresh me on who muddied the word. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7067.08s)]
*  Oh, you assholes. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7068.400000000001s)]
*  No, a lot of things muddied that word. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7069.28s)]
*  The people in charge. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7071.04s)]
*  But UFO was also muddied by crazy people. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7072.48s)]
*  Oh, I know, they're useful to help muddy waters. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7074.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, listen man, they do it on their own. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7076.879999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of people that do it on their own. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7079.919999999999s)]
*  Well, okay, once you tell the first lie, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7081.5199999999995s)]
*  yeah, all kinds of speculations are gonna happen. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7084.759999999999s)]
*  Why the fuck are you allowed [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7088.16s)]
*  to keep these secrets, motherfucker? [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7089.48s)]
*  I'm sure I'm supposed to go, oh, it's a complicated world. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7091.4s)]
*  Yeah, lying does complicate the world. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7094.719999999999s)]
*  That's true, that's true. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7096.5199999999995s)]
*  Like if they do have secrets, that's true. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7097.759999999999s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that the UFO stuff was muddied up [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7100.08s)]
*  with the same reason why the Loch Ness stuff was muddied up. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7103.8s)]
*  It was like people that got high at parties [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7107.44s)]
*  and annoyed the shit out of you with Nessie stories. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7110.8s)]
*  You're like enough, you're a fool. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7114.28s)]
*  You're wasting all your time paying attention [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7116.2s)]
*  to something that's not real. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7117.72s)]
*  Yeah, so we almost say I'm sorry for you. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7118.72s)]
*  UFO got put into that category for a long time. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7120.36s)]
*  Well, that's where you hide it. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7122.5199999999995s)]
*  Here's where you hide things. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7123.72s)]
*  But this is the thing that happened. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7124.88s)]
*  They shifted it in 2017. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7126.56s)]
*  So in 2017 when the New York Times makes that report, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7128.68s)]
*  now all of a sudden this is a real story. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7131.320000000001s)]
*  Was COVID happening yet? [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7133.08s)]
*  Not yet, no, 2017. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7134.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, good. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7135.92s)]
*  So we got prepped for maybe some disclosures. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7136.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7139.360000000001s)]
*  I think that they needed to do that [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7140.68s)]
*  in order to slowly leak what they already have. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7143.84s)]
*  I wanna know how they're gonna tell anybody anything [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7147.16s)]
*  because here's why you gotta keep a secret for a long time. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7149.8s)]
*  The secret's real bad. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7152.96s)]
*  So how am I gonna tell? [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7154.84s)]
*  It's like somebody's cheating on their girl [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7157.76s)]
*  with a horse or some shibble shit. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7159.360000000001s)]
*  You were lying to Congress. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7161.280000000001s)]
*  So if you lied to Congress, you're in trouble. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7163.0s)]
*  They own Congress. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7164.84s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7165.92s)]
*  If it comes to a trial and it gets exposed, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7166.84s)]
*  some people get sent down the river. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7170.04s)]
*  Some people get sacrificed. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7173.76s)]
*  That's probably what happened with Epstein, right? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7175.2s)]
*  Of course. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7177.6s)]
*  People get sacrificed. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7178.4400000000005s)]
*  And fucking, Hugh Hefner made it to the end. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7179.280000000001s)]

*  You know Boss Hogg was CIA. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7186.320000000001s)]

*  And he was Strom Thurmond and somebody else he didn't like. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7195.92s)]
*  That's the voice he was doing for Boss Hogg. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7200.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's wearing a padded suit. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7202.24s)]
*  He's not even fat, I don't think. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7203.2s)]

*  This guy did not like Strom Thurmond. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7268.04s)]
*  Despicable. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7269.639999999999s)]
*  He was 5'6", 185. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7270.8s)]
*  Oh, that's crazy. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7272.08s)]
*  I didn't see, yeah. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7273.16s)]
*  Well actually that probably... [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7274.0s)]
*  He wore padding to seem fatter. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7276.56s)]
*  Just Google a scene, Boss Hogg on Dukes of Hazzard. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7278.92s)]
*  Let's watch a scene. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7283.24s)]
*  He was definitely a little fat. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7285.76s)]
*  I think Bob Odenkirk got his impression of Southerners [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7287.04s)]
*  from when I used to watch Mr. Show, [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7289.96s)]
*  I think he was doing Boss Hogg. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7291.64s)]
*  I might be wrong. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7292.88s)]
*  My question was, you can't show the Dukes of Hazzard [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7293.72s)]
*  anymore because of that fucking General Lee. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7297.76s)]
*  There's just some good old boys never meaning to harm. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7299.6s)]
*  I go through like a Detroit assembly line. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7301.76s)]
*  Now let's see what color is he got here. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7303.8s)]

*  I just come in to report. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7321.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, what a horrendous gunshot wound. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7323.32s)]
*  How come you're still standing? [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7326.719999999999s)]
*  All right, which one of you cut-throats [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7328.48s)]

*  Let's go bust. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7332.5599999999995s)]
*  Will you hush up, you do-do? [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7333.4s)]
*  That's just paint! [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7334.92s)]
*  What, see? [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7336.4s)]
*  Hey, that's just paint. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7339.24s)]
*  This shows you the evolution of culture [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7340.76s)]
*  because that might be one of the dumbest scenes [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7342.56s)]
*  I've ever seen in my life. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7343.88s)]
*  It's amazing that this was a popular show. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7345.04s)]
*  He's mocking a guy he doesn't like with that voice. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7346.92s)]
*  I know, but the show's terrible. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7349.32s)]
*  It's so bad. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7351.84s)]
*  Go back and look at all the 80s movies you ever watched [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7352.68s)]
*  and the messages are kind of strange. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7354.96s)]
*  But that show, that show's so bad. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7357.0s)]
*  At least that scene in that show is so bad. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7360.04s)]
*  But the point is, because of the General Lee, [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7362.16s)]
*  because of the Confederate flag, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7365.28s)]
*  they pulled it off a television. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7366.92s)]
*  So you don't see it anymore. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7369.16s)]
*  Which is like- [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7370.5599999999995s)]
*  I heard Bill Cosby bought it so he couldn't watch it. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7371.4s)]
*  Didn't he? [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7373.36s)]
*  He did that with something, right? [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7375.48s)]
*  The little rascal supposed to. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7376.92s)]
*  I don't know if that's true or not. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7378.16s)]
*  I don't know if that's true or not either. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7379.32s)]
*  Look, all these rich people, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7380.4s)]
*  they get to a level like you're Rockefeller. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7382.08s)]
*  We have PR thanks to Rocket [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7384.8s)]
*  because nobody liked that motherfucker [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7385.96s)]
*  and so they invented PR to help sell him. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7387.28s)]
*  That's why we have who's your favorite billionaire, right? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7390.84s)]
*  So you're like, people hate Elon Musk. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7394.4400000000005s)]

*  Bezos? [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7401.12s)]
*  You should pick one like a feudal lord [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7402.52s)]
*  and you should serve under them and fly their banner [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7404.32s)]
*  and you could do it with these great, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7406.76s)]
*  now I serve Hawk to a coin. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7408.56s)]

*  It's all Nazi shit. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7421.68s)]
*  The whole, every single thing. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7424.32s)]
*  The programming is the Prussian school. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7427.08s)]
*  We brought Nazis after the war. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7429.84s)]
*  They helped us go to the moon at NASA, right? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7431.84s)]

*  of things that this administration's kind of doing. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7464.2s)]
*  Like trying to clean house. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7467.48s)]

*  is that he like openly talked about getting rid of the CIA. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7474.639999999999s)]

*  Especially back then. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7493.0s)]
*  Like back then it was so easy to keep a secret [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7494.08s)]
*  in comparison to now. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7496.5199999999995s)]

*  Who the hell got him in and out? [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7510.56s)]
*  Well, that's when we worked with Reinhard Galen [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7511.84s)]
*  from the SS. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7514.280000000001s)]

*  It's interesting that it's so, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7544.24s)]
*  it puts so many other things into question. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7546.08s)]
*  Yeah, well now that I don't believe in God, I got nothing. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7548.280000000001s)]
*  So I gotta believe in this forever, don't I? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7550.6s)]
*  Now that I know I'm a scientific materialist, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7553.4800000000005s)]
*  I know there is no God, cause you, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7555.68s)]
*  what else can I rely on except [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7557.96s)]
*  the promise of transhumanism one day? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7559.72s)]
*  I will be a robot man. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7561.84s)]
*  That's a, these fucking weirdos say this shit. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7563.72s)]
*  There is no need, I'm watching Bad Thad on here go, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7566.8s)]
*  there is nothing, there's no essence of anything. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7569.88s)]
*  It's all like not, you know, just name it and claim it. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7573.44s)]
*  I'm like, do you know how insane that is, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7577.8s)]
*  what just came out of your fucking mouth? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7579.44s)]
*  But they think that. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7580.92s)]
*  Well, it's just intellectual gymnastics. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7582.12s)]
*  They're just doing intellectual gymnastics. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7585.08s)]
*  They're playing around with ideas [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7586.84s)]
*  and they think they're smart enough. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7588.4s)]
*  Their ego is so silly that they think they're smart enough [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7590.0s)]
*  to take in a logical thing and promote it as logical, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7593.32s)]

*  or like an abstract thinker. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7598.799999999999s)]
*  Well, how do you make your money? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7601.2s)]
*  And then. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7602.24s)]
*  You make your money by being a bullshit artist [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7603.08s)]
*  that's pretending to be a rebel. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7604.799999999999s)]
*  If I'm on a shape, if I'm a Bill Gates [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7606.32s)]
*  that's just so concerned about the health [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7608.28s)]
*  of the children of the world, you know, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7610.04s)]

*  It's not just about the money, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7614.92s)]
*  it's about my fucking Pharaoh's tomb I should have. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7616.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking get people like that [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7620.0s)]
*  that care about the money [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7621.92s)]
*  and they're gonna be under me in my little pyramid. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7622.84s)]
*  Isn't it interesting that we always know [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7624.8s)]
*  that that has been the case throughout history, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7626.32s)]
*  but we don't wanna believe it's happening [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7628.32s)]
*  with the elites of the world now. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7629.92s)]
*  Like in our minds, we wanna separate the people of today [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7631.68s)]
*  from the people of the past that did the same thing [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7635.0s)]

*  Hey, I don't wanna believe I'm bald, but guess what? [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7639.400000000001s)]
*  I gotta wear a Hawk Tuah hat wherever I go. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7642.0s)]
*  Name it and claim it. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7645.8s)]
*  So you were saying that the Hawk Tuah girl has gone missing? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7647.04s)]
*  No, I don't think she, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7651.04s)]
*  she probably hasn't posted online. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7653.12s)]
*  I think now's the time to get in. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7653.959999999999s)]
*  But Jamie was telling me she's supposedly missing. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7656.24s)]
*  But it's like when Suri Cruz was missing. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7658.48s)]
*  Didn't she make a statement saying she had no idea [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7660.719999999999s)]
*  what the fuck was going on? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7662.719999999999s)]
*  Like she didn't understand. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7664.08s)]
*  Yo, Coffee Zilla had a thing about it. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7665.719999999999s)]
*  Like the dude, DJ Hollywood or whatever, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7668.12s)]
*  he's married to Howie Mandel's daughter. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7671.599999999999s)]
*  He's known for starting these up. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7674.04s)]
*  So it's like a George Foreman grill. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7675.5599999999995s)]
*  George Foreman didn't invent the grill. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7677.08s)]
*  They're like, this is your grill, George Foreman. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7678.799999999999s)]
*  That's what they did with Hawk Tuah. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7680.5199999999995s)]
*  How many different crypto coins are there, Jamie? [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7682.04s)]
*  Did we find that out? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7685.88s)]
*  It's honestly, it's innumerable. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7687.16s)]
*  I want it to be dead ass. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7689.96s)]
*  Innumerable. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7691.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7692.32s)]
*  So it could be a million? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7693.6s)]
*  Yeah, we could start 10 right now [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7695.04s)]
*  and they could all be called the same thing. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7697.56s)]
*  Now do you like boy Hawk Tuah, AKA? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7699.0s)]
*  How much money are you putting behind it? [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7700.4400000000005s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7701.76s)]
*  It's like, if you were a crazy person that invested in NFTs. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7702.6s)]
*  I am. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7707.0s)]
*  If you're one of those people [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7708.4400000000005s)]
*  that gets in on these things, [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7709.56s)]
*  why wouldn't you get in on this stuff? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7710.72s)]
*  It seems like some people are probably, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7712.68s)]
*  just like some people are professional poker players. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7715.52s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7717.72s)]
*  There's a coin called Fartcoin that started up. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7719.56s)]
*  It's like a billion dollar market cap. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7721.84s)]
*  But how it was started, I was trying to get into, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7725.120000000001s)]
*  was someone turned on to it, like an AI, maybe two AIs, [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7726.84s)]
*  and gave it some parameters and it created this coin. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7731.0s)]
*  And so then someone launched it. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7736.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's the thing my buddy was on. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7737.320000000001s)]
*  They launched it, now it's worth a billion dollars. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7738.72s)]
*  Why it's that is all the parameters and the project [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7741.2s)]
*  and everything it's supposed to do [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7744.16s)]
*  and what they're supposed to do [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7745.2s)]
*  is all laid out here on this website, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7746.04s)]
*  which almost all of them are, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7747.36s)]
*  I think you're supposed to have that. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7748.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7750.12s)]
*  Here's the big question though. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7751.4s)]
*  Where's the money coming from? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7752.759999999999s)]
*  If it's worth a billion dollars, is that real money? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7753.88s)]
*  Has someone spent a billion dollars? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7756.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, someone fronts a billion. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7758.28s)]
*  Like in theory, if you think there's a billion to start, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7759.44s)]
*  someone put a billion. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7761.48s)]
*  Is that true? [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7762.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7763.44s)]
*  It doesn't come from nowhere. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7764.28s)]
*  Wait a minute. Really? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7765.759999999999s)]
*  So you can start a coin, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7766.599999999999s)]
*  but you need a billion dollars of real money? [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7767.679999999999s)]
*  It's the pump. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7769.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7770.759999999999s)]
*  You got a pump before you can dump. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7771.599999999999s)]
*  So it's actual money or is it crypto money? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7773.2s)]
*  This is the question. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7776.24s)]
*  Like I was saying, like, does the Trump coin, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7777.2s)]
*  did people take their Shibu Inu coins and buy Trump coins? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7779.24s)]
*  Do you do, is that what- [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7782.5199999999995s)]
*  It almost doesn't matter. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7783.36s)]
*  Look, it all could be exchanged for now. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7784.639999999999s)]
*  It does matter because if you put it [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7786.759999999999s)]
*  on your American Express card, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7787.92s)]
*  at the end of the month, you're gonna have to pay. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7789.12s)]
*  In order to do that though, you have to make, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7790.32s)]
*  in order to do what you just said, [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7792.08s)]
*  you have to make, you have to go through an exchange [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7793.12s)]
*  to exchange it into a coin. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7795.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7796.36s)]
*  But then you're exchanging on the website. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7797.2s)]
*  I'm like Poor Dad from Rich Dad Poor Dad. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7798.04s)]
*  I've never watched that. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7801.32s)]
*  Oh, well Rich Dad says, go into debt. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7802.2s)]
*  That guy's a billionaire in debt. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7804.5199999999995s)]
*  You've never seen Rich Dad Poor Dad? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7806.32s)]
*  No. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7808.76s)]
*  His real story is so much better than his fake story. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7810.32s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7812.6s)]
*  Here's my advice. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7813.6s)]

*  That's what Poor Dad used to say. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7817.08s)]
*  Real freedom is the ability to do what you want [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7818.84s)]
*  when you want to do it. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7821.28s)]
*  My Rich Dad told me only poor people work. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7822.48s)]
*  You only have one dad, right? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7825.86s)]
*  I think Trump's done to somebody about a billion dollars. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7827.7s)]
*  Like if I owe you a billion dollars, it's your problem. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7830.9s)]

*  And that's why I look. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7837.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7838.94s)]

*  is you have to meet other wealthy people. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7846.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and so imagine like. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7847.98s)]
*  And hang out with them. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7849.299999999999s)]
*  It must be fucking weird. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7850.78s)]
*  It's so weird. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7852.5s)]
*  It's so weird because I'm pretty normal. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7853.94s)]

*  of being a part of these elite groups? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7871.78s)]
*  Because people want to be a part of this. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7874.759999999999s)]
*  You want to be in the secret meeting. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7876.58s)]
*  To get as much power as possible. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7877.74s)]

*  and speak at the conferences [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7880.74s)]
*  and be around all these other rich ballers [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7882.1s)]
*  and rub elbows with all the elites. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7883.9400000000005s)]
*  Have a drink. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7885.740000000001s)]
*  And then you wake up and I show you a godfather. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7886.580000000001s)]
*  Your liver's on a tray. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7889.1s)]
*  You wake up in a tub. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7890.42s)]
*  Or you're in a tub with a gun in the kitchen. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7891.9800000000005s)]

*  How much of that you've seen. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7901.14s)]
*  It's really odd. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7902.700000000001s)]
*  Almost as if somebody had something on him, isn't it? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7903.54s)]
*  A little weird. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7905.900000000001s)]
*  It gets weird. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7906.900000000001s)]
*  What happened to Bernie? [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7907.740000000001s)]
*  That's a broken man. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7908.56s)]
*  I wonder what they did to him. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7909.400000000001s)]
*  Didn't he just tweet something ridiculous? [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7910.24s)]
*  He better or else something's gonna come out [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7912.32s)]
*  he don't like. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7913.84s)]
*  That's how I take it. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7914.679999999999s)]
*  He tweeted something ridiculous. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7915.5s)]
*  When I read that I was like, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7916.5199999999995s)]
*  this does not even make logical sense. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7917.36s)]
*  All these people saying shit that makes no logical sense. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7919.04s)]
*  If you're motivated, you'll say the shit that makes no, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7922.36s)]
*  if you're properly motivated. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7925.219999999999s)]
*  One of my favorite things was in the Bernie people [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7926.8s)]
*  were mad at Bernie for making money off of his book. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7928.32s)]
*  Cause he made like a million bucks off his book. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7930.54s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7932.8s)]
*  And they're like, oh, you're a part of the problem now. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7933.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, his part of the problem happened in legislation, [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7935.88s)]
*  not in the book part. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7939.28s)]
*  I think that's pretty honest actually the book [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7940.32s)]
*  cause most of them get paid out the ass. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7942.599999999999s)]
*  I think the idealistic perspective [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7944.96s)]
*  of what he was trying to do makes a little bit of sense. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7947.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well that's why they pick a guy [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7949.92s)]
*  and he's the guy that's allowed to say that, [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7951.5199999999995s)]
*  but he ain't gonna back it up. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7953.8s)]
*  Well, they were worried that he was going to, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7955.599999999999s)]
*  they were worried that he was gonna be able to make it [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7957.08s)]
*  into the actual White House, [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7958.719999999999s)]
*  which is why they sabotaged him in the primaries. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7960.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7962.759999999999s)]
*  They were worried. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7963.599999999999s)]
*  But don't worry, he would have thrown it. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7964.42s)]
*  My first attacks, when CNN said that my show was sexist [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7965.92s)]
*  and racist and transphobic and homophobic. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7971.2s)]
*  Yeah, you're like, those Bernie bros. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7973.04s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7974.24s)]
*  Oh, that's a catchphrase, a Bernie bro. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7975.08s)]
*  Right, you turn them into a scumbag. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7976.96s)]
*  You turn them into like, or a clown, a Bernie bro. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7978.68s)]
*  Well, you get an identity, see identity politics, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7982.16s)]
*  the great part of that is you can take, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7984.54s)]
*  instead of talking about shit that matters, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7986.8s)]
*  you know, the economics let's say, [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7988.4400000000005s)]
*  you can talk about shit that doesn't matter, [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7990.28s)]
*  which is your outer shell. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7991.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7994.16s)]
*  And you can pretend, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7995.0s)]
*  and you can turn the superficial into the most, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7995.88s)]
*  and that's where we live now. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7998.04s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=7999.22s)]
*  In MK retard land. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8000.06s)]
*  Bleh. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8001.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8002.48s)]
*  I mean, gold, I could see how they start using gold. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8006.92s)]
*  It works. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8009.76s)]
*  Well, it's not as old as I thought it was, [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8010.58s)]
*  which kind of throws my whole fucking theory [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8013.3s)]
*  into a muncher wrench. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8014.96s)]
*  Can't spell gold without old. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8015.8s)]
*  That's what we say in the gold business. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8016.64s)]
*  Still doesn't make sense to me [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8018.24s)]
*  that even thousands of years ago, [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8019.32s)]
*  we all agreed on these stupid metal coins, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8020.48s)]
*  but it does make sense that you kind of need something. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8023.18s)]
*  Like if it just logically. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8025.96s)]
*  They probably had a prehistoric Jekyll Island [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8027.820000000001s)]
*  where the cave, JP Morgan and the rest of the boys met, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8029.900000000001s)]
*  and then they're like, we're gonna use gold from now on. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8033.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, it used to be salt. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8036.740000000001s)]
*  Salt, they used to go to war for salt. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8038.06s)]
*  That's why I never believe, [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8039.740000000001s)]
*  and I think it's not true about salting the earth [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8040.780000000001s)]
*  to make crops not grow. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8043.200000000001s)]
*  Like, can you imagine you're Roman, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8044.3s)]
*  and they're like, you got done with the battle, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8045.66s)]
*  like, all right, we're gonna dump, let's say your pay. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8047.1s)]
*  Can we not dump my paycheck on the earth? [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8049.62s)]
*  Like, a rain is gonna wash it away. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8051.18s)]
*  Salt was worth so much money [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8052.66s)]
*  because you could preserve meat with it. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8054.639999999999s)]
*  Otherwise you couldn't have meat [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8056.5199999999995s)]
*  because they didn't have refrigeration. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8057.86s)]
*  So they would take everything they would cover with salt. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8059.0599999999995s)]
*  So salt kills bacteria. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8060.94s)]
*  I should probably eat more salt to preserve my meat. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8062.62s)]
*  Well, people think that salt lowers your, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8065.139999999999s)]
*  makes your blood pressure higher. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8067.86s)]
*  There's like so much stupid shit that's connected with salt. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8069.3s)]
*  It turned out was the thing where they pay [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8071.78s)]
*  to pretend it's not that, you know, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8073.9s)]
*  like your fructose is in your. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8075.22s)]
*  Well, it got lumped into that whole thing [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8077.48s)]
*  where they were trying to connect saturated fat [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8080.34s)]
*  and heart disease because the sugar companies. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8084.38s)]
*  What you live through when they flip the polls [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8088.14s)]
*  on what's good and bad, like several times. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8090.22s)]
*  Well, that one's documented, right? [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8092.5s)]
*  Cause that one, they actually, they bribed scientists. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8093.96s)]
*  The sugar industry bribed scientists to lie. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8096.78s)]
*  And so that flipped it on. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8099.38s)]
*  And then they were looking for other reasons [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8100.78s)]
*  why people were getting fat, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8102.42s)]
*  and other reasons why people were having hypertension [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8103.62s)]
*  and all these different things. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8105.9800000000005s)]
*  And salt got thrown into the mix there. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8106.82s)]
*  But the problem is salt's an essential mineral. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8108.98s)]
*  It's like a very important thing for human life. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8111.62s)]
*  Yeah, like carbon. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8114.62s)]
*  Yeah, you fucking actually need it. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8115.7s)]
*  You should put salt in your water in the morning. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8118.9s)]
*  Take some Celtic salt, sprinkle it in some hot water [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8121.299999999999s)]
*  in the morning and put it like, [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8124.58s)]
*  squeeze a little lemon in there. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8125.759999999999s)]
*  It's fucking good for you. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8127.099999999999s)]
*  Salt, salt's very important. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8128.48s)]
*  You should never get any sun, right? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8130.78s)]
*  That's what I was told. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8132.259999999999s)]
*  You should get sun. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8133.099999999999s)]
*  Get no sun on your. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8133.94s)]
*  This idea that then the bad skin cancer that people get [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8135.139999999999s)]
*  from what I've, makes him. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8138.5s)]
*  Jimmy had it. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8140.7s)]
*  He was explaining the whole fucking thing. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8141.54s)]
*  He did. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8142.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he had the kind that where it's not. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8143.82s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8145.86s)]
*  And the kind that's bad, generally you get [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8147.22s)]
*  because you're not exposed to the sun. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8149.12s)]
*  Boy, what a blooper. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8151.06s)]
*  You get exposed to the sun in like a big burst [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8152.9s)]
*  and your skin's not prepared for it. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8155.26s)]
*  What a blooper they made with that one. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8156.1s)]
*  They went with so many things, man. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8158.58s)]
*  With the downplaying the positive impact of exercise [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8160.5s)]
*  and diet on health. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8165.54s)]
*  Do you think that was suspicious? [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8166.74s)]
*  Global health comes from a fucking injection. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8167.74s)]
*  Wait, do you think that was even. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8169.86s)]
*  How about that? [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8171.38s)]
*  How about. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8172.22s)]
*  Global health people, the people that aren't healthy. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8173.0599999999995s)]
*  How about that? [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8175.54s)]
*  How about look at them and you go, [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8176.38s)]

*  You don't wanna fuck Peter Hotez? [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8178.14s)]
*  Like, ew, RFK, he's 70 and he looks like that. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8179.78s)]
*  And look at this fucking. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8186.42s)]
*  Well, he's, when I had Peter Hotez on [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8187.94s)]
*  and we talked about food and diet, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8190.0599999999995s)]
*  I was like, this is the most crazy unscientific perspective. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8191.6s)]
*  I was very kind to him about it, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8194.46s)]
*  but I was like, you don't eat well [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8195.7s)]
*  and you don't take vitamins. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8198.1s)]
*  Yeah, take that lab coat off, motherfucker. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8198.94s)]
*  And you don't exercise. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8200.58s)]
*  This is crazy talk. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8202.14s)]
*  This is absolutely crazy talk [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8204.22s)]
*  because there's a fucking giant amount [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8205.5s)]
*  of scientific literature on the positive impact [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8208.14s)]
*  of all those things. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8210.62s)]
*  So if you are not addressing that science [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8211.86s)]
*  and your only science is I have to stick you [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8215.14s)]
*  with a fucking experimental needle. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8217.18s)]
*  And I happen to make the thing that we stick in here. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8219.02s)]
*  I happen to be a guy that makes money off that. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8221.26s)]
*  But don't worry about that. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8223.06s)]
*  You think I would promote it if it wasn't the best thing? [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8224.5s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8226.54s)]
*  It's just, we don't wanna believe [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8227.74s)]
*  that that's how people in positions of authority [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8229.54s)]
*  would ever behave because the responsibility [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8232.7s)]
*  that comes with being in that position [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8234.94s)]
*  where you're the person that informs everybody else. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8236.62s)]
*  And you're knowingly going through this [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8239.42s)]
*  with fucking huge blinders on [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8241.9s)]

*  you don't realize, oh, it really is hypocritical of me. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8245.7s)]
*  I should actually supplement my food with vitamins. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8248.26s)]
*  I should stop eating garbage. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8252.02s)]

*  All that stuff is terrible for you if that's your diet. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8262.86s)]
*  I think it was Time Magazine that said, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8265.34s)]
*  actually processed food probably isn't that bad. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8266.78s)]

*  And that Rockefeller made his money [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8360.94s)]
*  really kind of transporting the oil, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8362.7s)]
*  because there was oil all over the fucking place. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8364.62s)]
*  So a guy's gotta control all, like diamonds, let's say. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8367.060000000001s)]

*  they could just control all kinds of shit, [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8374.06s)]
*  and then they could say it's scarce, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8376.06s)]
*  and we don't have enough of it. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8377.619999999999s)]
*  And then they could do your carbon footprint, [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8379.1s)]
*  invent BP came up with that term, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8381.94s)]

*  Yeah, the church thought that you could offset sin [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8412.22s)]
*  by paying for it, and then they had a schism, I think. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8414.58s)]
*  So I think it didn't work out. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8416.539999999999s)]

*  They think that Trump is an evil man [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8497.14s)]

*  They were convicted for. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8623.74s)]
*  Do you know that the Justice Department under Biden, as they so eloquently said to the January [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8625.42s)]
*  6 people, if you accept it, because remember, they're like, Trump's going to do preemptive [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8630.1s)]
*  pardons. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8633.9s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8634.9s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8635.5s)]
*  Biden would never do that, if we recall. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8636.02s)]
*  And they got letters just so you know, if you accept the pardon, that means you're saying [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8638.34s)]
*  you're guilty and it doesn't unring. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8642.18s)]
*  There's the quote, unring the bell of your prosecution. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8644.060000000001s)]
*  And they're right. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8647.220000000001s)]
*  It doesn't because now and that's what what's his name? [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8648.220000000001s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8651.42s)]
*  I was talking about with Fauci like you can't plead the fifth ever again if you take a pardon. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8652.42s)]
*  That's what we're talking about last night. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8657.66s)]
*  So Fauci is going to rat people out. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8658.66s)]
*  That's cool. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8660.5s)]
*  I hope we stick with it. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8661.5s)]
*  If they bring him in and they make him sing, the thing is like he could perjure himself. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8662.5s)]
*  Like if you if they know something and you say something that is not true on the stand, [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8667.58s)]
*  if you lie on this, if they determine that you have a whole nother crime. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8672.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8675.5s)]
*  And the thing that they didn't pardon him for is the stuff that happened during the [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8676.5s)]
*  AIDS crisis. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8679.22s)]
*  I don't know what the statute of limitations on that stuff is. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8680.54s)]
*  But if you go back and you want to try him for what he knew. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8682.9s)]
*  I mean, this is the Dallas Buyers Club. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8685.98s)]
*  You want to try him for what he knew about suppressing other therapeutics other than [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8687.54s)]
*  AZT. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8692.02s)]
*  Or if you knew that he had the data on AZT and how quickly it was killing people. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8693.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8698.02s)]
*  Well, once you do the first batch of mass murder, it's easy to go from there, isn't [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8699.02s)]
*  it? [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8702.06s)]
*  In the 1980s and 90s, like no one knew what the fuck was going on. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8703.06s)]
*  There's no Internet. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8705.74s)]
*  There's no RFK Jr. spreading the word with his book. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8706.74s)]
*  No one gets that information. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8710.1s)]
*  So that happened for a long ass time. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8711.539999999999s)]
*  And then when he tried to do it again in 2019, the single fucking solution is the vaccine [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8714.1s)]
*  and the vaccine only people will drop their ideological bullshit and get vaccinated. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8720.1s)]
*  You know, Matt Orfala does those great compilations of him saying the opposite. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8726.22s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8729.66s)]
*  He's crazy. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8730.66s)]
*  It's that's a person that's in an extreme position of power. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8731.66s)]
*  They probably got drunk with it and, you know, and is able to justify a lot of wild shit. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8735.26s)]
*  OK, the way they can justify it is because most of these people are controlled by some [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8741.1s)]
*  kind of Intel, hopefully ours, but maybe not. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8744.82s)]
*  And we still make do gain a hey, good news. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8748.140000000001s)]
*  We do gain a function. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8751.5s)]
*  And with China, our adversary still, I don't know why that would be. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8752.5s)]
*  Well, wasn't that also the talk about Ukraine, that Ukraine had bio weapons? [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8755.7s)]
*  Peaceful. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8759.62s)]
*  No, no, they had. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8760.62s)]
*  Let me quote peaceful bio labs. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8762.86s)]
*  Oh, peaceful. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8765.38s)]
*  Now, I don't know if you know the nuanced difference between a peaceful bio lab and [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8766.38s)]
*  a bio weapon lab, but it's real nuanced. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8769.619999999999s)]
*  Peaceful bio lab is where they grow mushrooms. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8772.98s)]
*  That's right by my mushroom gum. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8775.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's the name of the company. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8777.06s)]
*  Peaceful bio labs. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8778.06s)]
*  By the way, if mushrooms become legal, somebody please make a make a product called peaceful [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8779.06s)]
*  bio labs. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8784.94s)]
*  They'll be fun. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8785.94s)]
*  Like, you know, it's like a tribute to the show. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8786.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, I love in the Korean War, those soldiers didn't want to come home. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8789.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8793.74s)]
*  And this is what started the mind control race in the Manchurian candidate and all those [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8794.74s)]
*  movies was these soldiers wouldn't come come back. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8798.1s)]
*  They defected to North Korea. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8801.34s)]
*  And they said the United States has been using weaponized viral, you know, germ warfare on [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8803.26s)]
*  the people of Korea. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8808.98s)]
*  And so that's when we knew they must be under mind control to say such nonsense. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8810.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8814.42s)]
*  There's no way the government would do that. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8815.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8816.42s)]
*  So we know. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8817.42s)]
*  So that's how we knew for sure. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8818.42s)]
*  And so that started a nice mind control race. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8820.02s)]
*  And that's why you we have the story of the Manchurian candidate because China was go [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8822.18s)]
*  whoever the fuck was going to do it. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8826.98s)]
*  Guess what? [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8829.1s)]
*  When you hear about what our enemies are up to, that's how we fund what we're up to by [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8830.1s)]
*  spook scare. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8834.26s)]
*  Oh, they don't want to tell people the truth because it'll panic them. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8835.26s)]
*  When the fuck do they not want you panicked? [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8839.22s)]
*  Is this a different government that I haven't heard of? [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8840.98s)]
*  The number one thing they love is you to be traumatized and then forgetful. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8843.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8848.38s)]
*  The UAP thing, they don't want you to be traumatized by something more powerful than them. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8850.339999999998s)]
*  The problem with the UAP thing is it dissolves our faith in government because government [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8853.539999999999s)]
*  is just as useless as us. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8858.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't think they were God. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8859.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8861.859999999999s)]
*  If there's something from another planet that's so beyond us that it has complete control [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8862.859999999999s)]
*  of our nuclear program, can pre-control of our Internet, our grid, controls the population, [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8867.74s)]
*  can't be totally invulnerable to weapons and comes down and takes over. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8872.619999999999s)]
*  So God? [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8877.539999999999s)]
*  It's a superior race. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8878.7s)]
*  A bunch of people already believe in the thing you said, but don't think it's aliens and [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8879.7s)]
*  they're fine with it. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8883.54s)]
*  In fact, like I think it's, oh, people are going to go crazy and then they're going to [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8884.94s)]
*  come at us is the fear. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8890.34s)]
*  Because that, you know, Orson Welles famous thing, I bring it up all the time, everyone [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8892.740000000002s)]
*  panicked because they thought it was real. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8896.740000000002s)]
*  That's not fucking true. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8898.18s)]
*  Well some people panic, but it wasn't nearly the hysteria. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8899.86s)]
*  People that tuned in in the middle that didn't know really freaked out. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8902.94s)]
*  I think it was not even that. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8906.02s)]
*  I think now that we know the papers didn't like radio because it was much like podcasting [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8907.5s)]
*  is to CNN. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8912.78s)]
*  They were trying to kill that is what I think. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8914.62s)]
*  Really? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8917.02s)]
*  Well it was greatly exaggerated, right? [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8918.02s)]
*  The negative impact. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8919.44s)]
*  And then taught as fucking science for many years. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8920.5s)]
*  People committed suicide. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8923.18s)]
*  That was the thing that we were told in school. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8924.18s)]
*  They told you people killed themselves from that. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8926.02s)]
*  Yes. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8928.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8929.5s)]
*  When I was in high school, I remember they were talking about Orson Welles and the teacher [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8930.5s)]
*  in high school was explaining. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8933.54s)]
*  I'm 90% sure of this. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8935.060000000001s)]
*  The foggy memory because I was probably 15. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8936.460000000001s)]
*  But in that foggy memory, I'm pretty sure they were talking about people committing [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8939.140000000001s)]
*  suicide because of it. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8942.42s)]
*  Yeah, hilarious. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8943.580000000002s)]
*  So that's before Roswell or whatever. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8944.580000000002s)]
*  See if there's any evidence that people did commit suicide after War of the Worlds. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8946.7s)]
*  Because look, there's a lot of schizophrenic people, unfortunately. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8952.1s)]
*  There are now. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8954.26s)]
*  Back then too, no? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8955.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8957.34s)]
*  Okay. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8958.34s)]
*  While the War of the Worlds radio broadcast is often associated with mass panic, there's [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8959.34s)]
*  No credible evidence of any widespread suicides directly caused by the broadcast. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8962.06s)]
*  The idea of people killing themselves due to believing in Martian invasion was real [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8966.82s)]
*  and is generally considered a myth. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8970.539999999999s)]
*  Though some listeners did experience significant distress and fear due to the realistic presentation [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8973.3s)]
*  of the fictional event. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8978.26s)]
*  I'm sure that's true. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8979.26s)]
*  So the suicides is probably what always happens, right? [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8980.26s)]
*  People exaggerate shit. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8982.699999999999s)]
*  Dude, how long are they going to use suicides as an excuse to lie? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8983.699999999999s)]
*  Climate change right now, that's like a dog you blame farts on. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8990.099999999999s)]
*  That's what climate change is. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8992.74s)]
*  Do the fires? [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8994.539999999999s)]
*  It's unbelievable watching that. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8997.14s)]
*  Well, people calling the fires climate change is crazy. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=8998.14s)]
*  How would that absolve Newsom and the gang if it was climate change? [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9000.46s)]
*  Either way, shouldn't you have water in the fucking hydrant? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9005.22s)]
*  Shouldn't you have more water because of climate change? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9007.699999999999s)]
*  You definitely should have water in the hydrant. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9009.66s)]
*  What is this? [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9011.14s)]
*  This was the opening to the 1984 Olympics. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9012.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9014.14s)]
*  Fake alien. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9015.14s)]
*  I don't think they told people about it either. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9016.14s)]
*  I'll kind of skim through it. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9021.14s)]
*  Is it Michael Jackson in there? [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9022.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9023.14s)]
*  What was it? [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9024.14s)]
*  They used some Disney people. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9025.14s)]
*  Apparently they went through a couple tests. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9026.14s)]
*  This is a jet engine of some sort. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9029.38s)]
*  Flying a flying saucer in. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9032.06s)]
*  They had a bunch of lights on it. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9033.699999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9035.699999999999s)]
*  They didn't tell anyone this was going to happen either. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9036.699999999999s)]
*  They just started doing it. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9038.74s)]
*  Oh my god, dude. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9039.939999999999s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9042.14s)]
*  And then there's an alien. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9043.14s)]
*  How big is it? [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9044.14s)]
*  What's the alien look like? [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9045.14s)]
*  I think it's like 50 feet. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9046.14s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9047.14s)]
*  Oh, it looked like there was a helicopter above it, dude. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9048.14s)]
*  Well they're flying over Olympics. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9050.98s)]
*  So this is the opening. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9053.14s)]
*  Right, but it's not suspended by a helicopter? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9055.14s)]
*  I don't believe so. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9057.14s)]
*  No, I was trying to read into how they did it. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9058.14s)]
*  I thought I saw a helicopter above it. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9059.14s)]
*  Let it go for a little bit. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9063.14s)]
*  Well, it's 10 minutes long. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9064.14s)]
*  They should do this at the mall in Miami sometime. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9065.14s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9067.14s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9068.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9069.14s)]
*  Boy, in 1970 or 84 rather, when this was going on, you probably scared the shit out [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9070.14s)]
*  of people. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9075.14s)]
*  They probably thought the real aliens were actually landing at the Olympics. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9076.14s)]
*  Finally. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9079.14s)]
*  God, look how excited people were about the Olympics back then. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9080.14s)]
*  Our ritual has attracted the sky gods. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9083.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9086.14s)]
*  There's the alien. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9087.14s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9088.14s)]
*  Dude, why do we have Olympics again? [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9089.14s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9091.14s)]
*  Well, because people want to make money off athletes that work for free. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9092.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's called eugenics. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9094.14s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9097.14s)]
*  It's been created. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9098.14s)]
*  Look at all the lights flashing. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9099.14s)]
*  And now we fix we have the alien himself. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9102.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9108.14s)]
*  That is no one on stilts. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9111.14s)]
*  That is a man seven feet eight inches tall. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9113.14s)]
*  What? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9116.14s)]
*  He's got seven fingers. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9117.14s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9125.14s)]
*  So that's how they practiced it. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9126.14s)]
*  So they practice when they talk about blue beam, alien invasion back then. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9128.14s)]
*  They practice it in 1984. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9132.14s)]
*  They're fine. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9133.14s)]
*  I want to know how they powered that spaceship thing. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9134.14s)]
*  That's how I was getting into it. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9137.14s)]
*  They had a article in 2004 when they're bringing it back up and the guy from Disney was explaining [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9138.14s)]
*  how he did it. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9143.14s)]
*  So if they could do that in 84 and then the government with all their black ops funds, [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9144.14s)]
*  they had laptops in the 70s and it's just a matter of how expensive it is to make. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9148.14s)]
*  And then that's why you're always like 30. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9152.14s)]
*  Just as a rule, you're about 30 years behind the best shit they got. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9153.14s)]
*  So you think all these things that people are seeing are ours? [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9157.14s)]
*  Well, the drones? [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9159.14s)]
*  No, the UFOs, the things that go underwater, the things that all these things that fly [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9160.14s)]
*  through the air. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9165.14s)]
*  They also made this in 1974. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9166.14s)]
*  This thing is called an X jet. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9167.14s)]
*  It was really loud though. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9169.14s)]
*  So like 19 what? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9171.14s)]
*  It was in the 70s. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9173.14s)]
*  This guy's flying around in a flying chair. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9174.14s)]
*  I looked up this could go 60 miles an hour up to 10,000 feet. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9176.14s)]
*  How many people died testing that? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9181.14s)]
*  They only tested it with three people as far as I. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9183.14s)]
*  How many left? [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9185.14s)]
*  And they didn't. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9186.14s)]
*  They had no flight experience. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9187.14s)]
*  They wanted that on purpose. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9188.14s)]
*  This is nuts. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9189.14s)]
*  So do you? [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9190.14s)]
*  This is nuts. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9191.14s)]
*  Dude, there's a bunch of shit. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9192.14s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9194.14s)]
*  It says no propeller. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9195.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's a jet engine underneath. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9196.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9197.14s)]
*  How hot does it get? [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9198.14s)]
*  What does it do to your balls? [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9199.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9200.14s)]
*  What does it do to your balls? [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9201.14s)]
*  Probably cooks your balls. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9202.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9203.14s)]
*  How do you not get cancer from that? [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9204.14s)]
*  It affirms your gender and flies you? [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9205.14s)]
*  You're not even supposed to fucking wear earbuds anymore. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9206.14s)]
*  Everybody's saying the EFI from those. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9209.14s)]
*  That's why I saw you last night. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9212.14s)]
*  I was like, what are you doing with Bluetooth earbuds in? [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9213.14s)]
*  It's supposed to be bad for you. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9216.14s)]
*  Hey, it's too late now, dude. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9218.14s)]
*  And even the wired ones. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9220.14s)]
*  I had the shot. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9221.14s)]
*  The wired ones are like slightly better. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9222.14s)]
*  But everybody's saying like, oh, yeah, fine. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9223.14s)]
*  If you just look at a screen. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9225.14s)]
*  Dude, all the shit you worried about, they done did it. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9227.14s)]
*  It's done. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9229.14s)]
*  You're not worried about the earbuds? [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9230.14s)]
*  No, no, I'm not worried because I already, I can't sleep unless I have a TV on just the tone. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9233.14s)]
*  So do you understand the amount of damage that has been done from the blue light from the screen? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9238.14s)]
*  They signed that into the world too. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9242.14s)]
*  That's another Obama hit. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9243.14s)]
*  You know, the energy saving light bulbs and all that where you just get blue light and it ravages your dopamine. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9245.14s)]
*  It's with principle of casinos. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9250.14s)]
*  Everything's a fucking casino. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9252.14s)]
*  So all the blue light that we have in our houses, like with LED lights, all that's bad for you? [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9254.14s)]
*  Yeah, but you could find out more about like I'm not an expert on by any means, but you can find out about people. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9258.14s)]
*  You sound like an expert. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9262.14s)]
*  I'd like to give you a doctorate. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9263.14s)]
*  Would you accept? [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9264.14s)]
*  Yes. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9265.14s)]
*  Now, I think you need an honorary doctorate. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9266.14s)]
*  Can I tell you? [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9268.14s)]
*  From like Conspiracy University. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9269.14s)]
*  Conspiracy University. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9270.14s)]
*  I'm a doctor of hoctuocoin. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9271.14s)]
*  Maybe Austin, you, when they open up here? [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9272.14s)]
*  I don't know, dude. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9275.14s)]
*  Helicopter, you're right. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9276.14s)]
*  Oh, so it was elevated by a helicopter. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9277.14s)]
*  It had to be high enough to be carried by a big lift helicopter. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9279.14s)]
*  Yeah, see, that's what I thought I saw. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9282.14s)]
*  I thought I saw a helicopter above it. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9284.14s)]
*  That makes a lot more sense. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9285.14s)]
*  You saw the Charles Hall video, right? [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9286.14s)]
*  That guy Charles Hall talking about the tall whites. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9288.14s)]
*  Yes. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9290.14s)]
*  So because that one, it was one of the first ones. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9291.14s)]
*  We talked about that yesterday on the podcast with Jay Sands. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9293.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9296.14s)]
*  So this is also how I started. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9297.14s)]
*  Now, conspiracy stuff would be like this to me. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9299.14s)]
*  Not like actual objective facts that are public record, [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9302.14s)]
*  but shit where I'm like, it's a guy's story. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9304.14s)]
*  So his story is so interesting because it's like, what made me laugh. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9307.14s)]
*  So I started looking at this as a joke because it's making me laugh [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9312.14s)]
*  when he's having the tall whites treat us like we're like, [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9314.14s)]
*  this is like the Philippines to them, like a base for doing stuff. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9317.14s)]
*  And if you, we're as strong as apes compared to them, [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9320.14s)]
*  is what he said about the tall eight foot very white people. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9324.14s)]
*  Jay Sands met one. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9328.14s)]
*  Well, as they're talking about it, I'm like, this sounds very familiar. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9329.14s)]
*  Like, is this, wait, is this like the Congo to them? [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9333.14s)]
*  Like, are these space Belgians? [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9335.14s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, wow, that's hilarious. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9337.14s)]
*  At the top, there's even whiter people. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9339.14s)]
*  But doesn't that make sense that if human beings evolve more, [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9342.14s)]
*  we're going to evolve more into like weaker and weaker things [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9345.14s)]
*  with stronger and stronger minds. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9348.14s)]
*  And that's what they look like. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9350.14s)]
*  Well, I'm sure they're like really frail. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9351.14s)]
*  He said that when it ran, it almost was like when it was moving fast, [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9353.14s)]
*  it was almost like it was running into the wind. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9356.14s)]
*  Like it was very awkward. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9358.14s)]
*  He's like physically the thing. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9359.14s)]
*  Did he say what Charles Hall said about it's not that they're telepathic. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9360.14s)]
*  They have a thing they can wear that looks like an Xbox headset. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9363.14s)]
*  No, he said that he it was making noises, [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9366.14s)]
*  but he was reading its intention in his mind. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9369.14s)]
*  And when the thing experienced disgust and anger, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9373.14s)]
*  he experienced disgust and anger that it was some sort of a telepathic link [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9376.14s)]
*  between him and his thing. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9380.14s)]
*  That's the difference in the story. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9381.14s)]
*  Honestly, this is just who fucking knows what really happened. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9382.14s)]
*  The guy's telling me he met an alien. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9385.14s)]
*  Well, I look for differences. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9386.14s)]
*  I'm not saying this definitely happened. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9387.14s)]
*  Of course. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9389.14s)]
*  What I'm saying is this is his story. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9390.14s)]
*  The thing had giant eyeballs that were twice the size of a human's. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9391.14s)]
*  And it had like such a light colored skin that he thought that it was suffering [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9394.14s)]
*  from hypothermia and that it was wearing military dress uniform. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9399.14s)]
*  So it was in a pristine, totally clean uniform. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9404.14s)]
*  And one of the guys in the car said, hey, he has no ears. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9407.14s)]
*  That's the first thing the guy said. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9410.14s)]
*  He said, this is what it looked like. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9411.14s)]
*  He said, although the nose looked a little bit rounder. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9412.14s)]
*  So I said this thing communicate with him and essentially imparted in his brain [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9414.14s)]
*  memories of the structure of this thing that it was looking for. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9419.14s)]
*  So I was looking for some specific type of metal that he didn't know what the [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9423.14s)]
*  fuck it meant. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9426.14s)]
*  And he couldn't we still couldn't figure out what he meant. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9427.14s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9430.14s)]
*  Yeah. But bizarre. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9431.14s)]
*  Right. So but if you think of like us to Neanderthals, Neanderthals to them, [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9433.14s)]
*  like it's going to move in that direction where they're spindly and weak. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9439.14s)]
*  They're not going to use their bodies anymore. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9442.14s)]
*  Sure. The main part I'm focusing on is the relationship that we have with these [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9444.14s)]
*  supposed white creatures. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9448.14s)]
*  Why? [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9450.14s)]
*  When I first heard of them, I remembered when I saw Charles Hall and I'd [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9453.14s)]
*  forgotten about this, but like 2011 and it was in I want to say Newsweek and [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9455.14s)]
*  it was like a wacky news item that around the same time as the Israeli guy [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9460.14s)]
*  that said he worked with the Federation, that ex Intel guy came out and said [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9464.14s)]
*  there's a Canadian ex Intel guy. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9468.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9470.14s)]
*  There's like 14 different star federations or something. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9471.14s)]
*  So some farcee newspaper said Obama works in league with some extraterrestrials [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9473.14s)]
*  called the Tall Whites. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9477.14s)]
*  And I had never ever heard anybody called the Tall Whites. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9479.14s)]
*  I think they meant the Bush family now. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9482.14s)]
*  I believe it was George H.W. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9484.14s)]
*  Bush looking back. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9487.14s)]
*  But at the time, because X-Files time when you know what it was the thing they [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9488.14s)]
*  push on your narrative, not saying whether there's aliens or not, but clearly [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9492.14s)]
*  don't want you to know the real story. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9496.14s)]
*  So what's the narrative they program you with? [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9498.14s)]
*  So in 84, that's the Steven Spielberg era. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9500.14s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9502.14s)]
*  Coming off the sci fi thing. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9503.14s)]
*  So all I'm doing is listen to everybody's story and I want to hear themes and I [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9505.14s)]
*  want to hear the differences. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9508.14s)]
*  So the guy, Doty, the guy who's the ex from Mirage Men, that movie. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9510.14s)]
*  And he now is like, I'm not lying anymore because I'm retired from lying. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9515.14s)]
*  And so I'll listen. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9520.14s)]
*  I'll hear your lies out. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9521.14s)]
*  But then I'll listen for you changing like just basic shit like the details when [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9523.14s)]
*  they change and they're always slight. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9527.14s)]
*  I'm like, wait, that's different than the. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9529.14s)]
*  So what I thought about Tall Whites, but this is I guess the Tall White technology [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9531.14s)]
*  of back in the 60s was they couldn't just do it with their mind. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9535.14s)]
*  They had a headset. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9538.14s)]
*  Charles Hall is very specific about how they did things. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9539.14s)]
*  And he was like, they're not like gods. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9542.14s)]
*  It stood out because it didn't have any of that fucking ESP kind of. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9544.14s)]
*  He goes, they had voice to skull. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9548.14s)]
*  They had a thing where they could talk into your head. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9549.14s)]
*  This thing was wearing a hat. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9551.14s)]
*  Maybe the thing was under the hat. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9553.14s)]
*  Maybe the hat disguised it. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9555.14s)]
*  Maybe it was the thing disguised as a hat. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9557.14s)]
*  Another thing that stuck out with Charles Hall that made me remember his story [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9559.14s)]
*  compared to other alien stories is they were not environmentalists. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9562.14s)]
*  They thought it was weird. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9566.14s)]
*  We ride horses and shit because they sit on most civilized worlds. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9567.14s)]
*  Author Charles James Hall claims to have lived with aliens for two years in Nevada. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9571.14s)]
*  After a few months, he finally overcame his fears and started to communicate [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9577.14s)]
*  with the extraterrestrials. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9580.14s)]
*  When you hear him talk, you'll understand. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9581.14s)]
*  I mean, let's say this is... [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9583.14s)]
*  It says overview. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9584.14s)]
*  What is it, a movie? [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9585.14s)]
*  Yeah, walking with the tall white... [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9586.14s)]
*  Oh, I know what I'm watching tonight. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9588.14s)]
*  Do me a favor and send me that. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9591.14s)]

*  Well, that's why China has a grudge against the UK to this day because of the opium wars. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9688.82s)]
*  Yeah, people have a hard time forgetting when you force them to... [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSPkPOFzQvE&t=9693.82s)]
