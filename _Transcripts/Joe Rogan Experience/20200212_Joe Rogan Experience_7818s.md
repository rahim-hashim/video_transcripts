# Joe Rogan Experience #1426 - Justin Martindale
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TStVaAMT3U)
*  I'm not supposed to smoke in my building, so.
*  They don't let you smoke weed in your building?
*  What kind of fucking arcade building?
*  Because it's legal.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  That makes sense.
*  We can't do things that are legal anymore.
*  But you can smoke cigarettes in your building, right?
*  No.
*  No, no, no.
*  No?
*  No.
*  Oh, you have a smoke-free building?
*  Yeah.
*  Health-conscious.
*  Well, I get that kind of if you say no cigarettes, you kind of have to say no weed too.
*  But cigarette smoke stays...
*  Cigarette gets in the walls and in the fabrics and all that stuff.
*  Like the weed just kind of...
*  For us.
*  Right.
*  But I think other people that don't smoke weed, they smell it.
*  Yeah, and those people need to get out of California.
*  I mean, you smell it everywhere you go now.
*  I know.
*  I'm so numb to it.
*  Everywhere.
*  It makes me laugh when I can see a tourist.
*  They're just like, oh, oh, oh.
*  And I'm like, this is funny.
*  It's so funny.
*  My wife kind of gets that way, and she smokes weed.
*  It's funny.
*  But like when we're with the kids, if we go somewhere, she's like, oh, lovely.
*  She'll smell it.
*  Like women are so funny.
*  Like when they have kids, all of a sudden they get like real protective of everything.
*  That's where conservative people...
*  Mama bear.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  Yep.
*  You want to protect that den.
*  Oh, great.
*  Yeah.
*  Lovely.
*  Out in public.
*  I was doing it an hour ago.
*  It always makes me laugh when I go and it's in the morning and you're like, shit, it's
*  like 9 a.m. and someone's just smoking a blunt outside a brunch.
*  Well, yoga, there's this one dude that I go to yoga with, this old fella, and he has
*  a van and he parks his van right next to the yoga place and he gets fucking blasted.
*  Just hot box.
*  Blasted.
*  It's like a Cheech and Chong movie.
*  He opens up that van and climbs into yoga class.
*  You could see him just whacked out in class.
*  Hot box yoga.
*  You could see him in class just like he's in the middle of doing his yoga and like freaking
*  out like, whew.
*  I saw a guy in the steam room at the gym doing that.
*  He was just like, ugh.
*  I was like, should I call someone?
*  He could be on anything.
*  The steam room with the gym is a dangerous area.
*  Like people are half naked and they get weird.
*  Yeah, that steam makes you do crazy things.
*  I just close my eyes and just meditate and try not to pay attention to the sounds going
*  on.
*  Also, like everybody, it's just like you're just sitting there, right?
*  So people get anxious.
*  They get antsy just sitting there.
*  And then you get like those really aggressive breathers who are just like, ugh.
*  You're like, was that a climax?
*  What was that?
*  Oh, by the way, hold on before I forget.
*  Speaking of climax, five years ago I came and did your podcast.
*  Was it that long ago?
*  It was five years ago, yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  It was up and coming.
*  God damn, it takes a long time.
*  Out of a tool shed.
*  Yeah, we were not far from here.
*  Here we are.
*  So what do you got?
*  That was last Valentine's Day.
*  So I feel like I got you some Valentine's Day candy.
*  Oh, hearts.
*  Because I feel like we have a running theme here.
*  Was it Valentine's Day last time?
*  Yeah.
*  No shit.
*  It was.
*  So I get it.
*  Two Joe from Justin.
*  So sweet.
*  You know, I'm getting more candy in your life.
*  Weird candies, right?
*  Because they only sell them because they're in the heart shape.
*  If they were stars, people would be like, what the fuck kind of bullshit candy is that?
*  Yeah, and they're probably filled with cyanide and horrible things for your body.
*  I don't think so.
*  So enjoy.
*  I don't think so, because they want to sell more.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a good old fashioned mess.
*  Did you see that fucking video of China where they're spraying disinfectant in the streets
*  to try to kill the coronavirus?
*  Jamie, it's on my...
*  Is that bullshit?
*  But they do that shit in Arkansas.
*  Some of them are real, but some of them, I think, are not accurate videos.
*  I don't know.
*  I've seen it on a couple different spots online.
*  I've seen various ones.
*  Let's pretend we're ignorant and we don't know any better.
*  Watch the video, because it's fucking bonkers, man.
*  They're driving through the streets, spraying everything at street level.
*  The thing I saw going around before, which is you didn't...
*  They were spraying with drones.
*  They were using drones to actually do it.
*  They're flying around people.
*  It begins...
*  Oh my God.
*  But see, they do that in the South with mosquitoes.
*  Yes.
*  So it's kind of like that.
*  Fucking terrible for you, too, by the way.
*  Of course.
*  If you breathe that shit in, if it kills mosquitoes, it'll kill you, too.
*  Absolutely.
*  That fucking stuff is awful.
*  All of our relatives are like, go play outside.
*  We're like, is this safe?
*  And they're like, yeah.
*  It's just off.
*  Dude, let's watch this real quick.
*  Oh, fine.
*  It's on my Twitter.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Along with my man, Eddie Izzard, is running 28 marathons in 28 days in 28 countries.
*  All through the month of February.
*  All in drag.
*  I have socks on my floor.
*  So look at this.
*  Look how crazy this is.
*  Yeah, this is nuts.
*  These fucking people, they're spraying shit out of cars.
*  They're walking down the street, spraying buildings.
*  It's all disinfectant.
*  Apparently, this coronavirus, they say, can live outside of a host for three days.
*  So if you have coronavirus on your hand, you touch a railing, that shit will exist
*  outside of your body for three days, which is very unusual.
*  That's like some parasite shit.
*  Well, this is what these doctors have been saying forever.
*  The one that died?
*  That's one of them.
*  But the doctors that studied at the CDC, Duncan and I went to the CDC down in Galveston, I
*  think it is.
*  And we were talking with these infectious disease experts.
*  We were all conspiracy theory like.
*  We're like, you know, like we're worried about like man-made viruses.
*  And he goes, listen, you don't have to worry about man-made viruses.
*  He goes, these motherfuckers are making them.
*  They're mutating.
*  He didn't use the term motherfucker.
*  Well, right.
*  Well, he wanted to.
*  Probably did.
*  But he was saying they make themselves and they happen all the time and we barely can
*  keep up with them.
*  And it just takes one big giant one like the Spanish flu.
*  The crazy thing in Spanish flu is 1920.
*  This is 2020.
*  It's like every every hundred years.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't want to say before that was what like yellow fever or something.
*  There's probably some shit in the 1820s.
*  Yeah.
*  Like down in the south, like the Carolinas and find out what was the pandemic in the 18.
*  Oh, here's the drones.
*  Jesus.
*  Army of drones deployed across China dispense disinfectants.
*  See, here's why I call that bullshit on that.
*  How much fucking disinfectant can they carry that little bullshit ass?
*  Then I'm going to kill.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They're so little.
*  They're going to kill and go refill.
*  And I love how it's Army of drones.
*  There's like three.
*  The thing them driving to the streets freaked me out more than anything.
*  Yeah, that's intense.
*  It is intense.
*  It's just like a fog.
*  The other thing too, that which was scary, I think it was real.
*  There was a drone that followed a woman out of her house.
*  She didn't have a mask on and it was like, ma'am, you're not you don't have a mask.
*  Please go home.
*  Go home.
*  You don't have and it followed her home in China.
*  Yeah.
*  Like that.
*  I can't translate.
*  So I don't know if what it was saying was there.
*  Someone just made a video to be scary.
*  This shit really is like a movie.
*  It is.
*  It's totally a movie.
*  Because everyone's got to be locked down in their houses.
*  They say kids are starving to death because they're locked in their houses and their parents
*  are in the hospital.
*  They just had like another, I think I got a notification last night that said there
*  was like a guy in San Diego that's being treated.
*  I'm like, God.
*  Yeah, it's just a matter of time.
*  Just let me do the Rogan podcast before I get coronavirus.
*  You're here and neither of us have it, I think.
*  They say you're supposed to wash your hands a lot, but that was before they realized that
*  it's transmitted through the air.
*  So I don't think that happens.
*  What's going on?
*  This is the lady.
*  This drone is speaking to you.
*  Could you imagine?
*  She has no idea what's going on.
*  She's so high.
*  You shouldn't walk without wearing a mask.
*  Yes, you better be home.
*  Don't forget to wash your hands.
*  She's got blue hair.
*  Oh, Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  Could also see someone fucking around to make a scary video.
*  Maybe.
*  But also could be real.
*  No, a drone is, it could be real.
*  I don't know.
*  That's terrifying.
*  Why did you come outside without a mask?
*  Hmm.
*  The snow will melt itself in a few months.
*  What?
*  A few months.
*  Is that a haiku?
*  What is this?
*  Stay at home with food and drinks.
*  Why do you always come outside?
*  You can sort of, this sounds, this might be bullshit, but it might be real.
*  I'm not feeling good about it.
*  It scares me, man.
*  It is.
*  It's like these things absolutely can wipe out millions and millions of people before
*  they can get a handle on it.
*  I had it, I was on a plane a couple weeks ago flying from New Orleans back here and
*  I had this Viking woman behind me just open mouth coughing and I had, I was like, first
*  of all, no.
*  Yeah.
*  Second of all, I had to turn around and say, hey, can you please cover your mouth?
*  And I had to do that to an adult woman and it made me feel weird.
*  Some people are just fucking selfish.
*  Just on a plane.
*  Some people, they just don't care.
*  They're just selfish.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't even care that other people feel uncomfortable.
*  They're just like, I have to cough.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're going to all experience it.
*  Yeah.
*  Some people, if they're sick, they want you to be sick.
*  They don't, they're not happy.
*  Malicious.
*  Fucking assholes.
*  And malignant.
*  Assholes.
*  I'm worried.
*  Don't be.
*  You know what I've been worried about a lot about lately is glyphosate.
*  I've been reading into glyphosate.
*  Same.
*  What is that?
*  You can't just glyphosate me.
*  What is that?
*  It's a roundup.
*  It's a chemical that they use for pesticide for agriculture.
*  And I was reading this whole thing about glyphosate and how toxic it is and how many people have
*  gotten cancer from glyphosate and how often they use glyphosate on vegetables.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm like, motherfucker.
*  That's why you have to wash your vegetables.
*  I don't think I need to wash.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all in there anyways.
*  Here it is.
*  As many as 85,000 glyphosate cancer lawsuits significantly closer to settlement after federal
*  trial suspended.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of motherfuckers that got cancer from this shit.
*  That's the roundup.
*  That's the weed.
*  Exactly.
*  The weed thing, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Kills your weeds.
*  I think it kills pesticides.
*  It's weed and what does it say there?
*  Scroll down.
*  Scroll back up there.
*  No, the actual image of the glyphosate.
*  Oh, God damn it.
*  These pop-ups.
*  What does it say?
*  It says weed and grass killer.
*  Okay.
*  So it's not a pesticide.
*  It's just for weeds.
*  Yeah.
*  But I bet it kills pests too.
*  No, it kills everything.
*  But apparently a lot of people that are gardeners and that are working on golf courses, golf
*  courses apparently, get it a lot because they spray that shit everywhere because they want
*  everything to just be grass.
*  But does it leave a brown spot?
*  No.
*  I don't know how the fuck it kills the weeds and doesn't kill the grass.
*  Yeah, that is true.
*  I'm Googling too that there are other stories that are going around.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  You reaffirmed that glyphosate does not cause cancer.
*  Don't worry, folks.
*  Just drink it.
*  There was a guy.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Just drink it.
*  There was a guy at a press conference who was saying, I could drink this glass of glyphosate
*  and it wouldn't do me any harm.
*  Some guy goes, drink it.
*  And he didn't.
*  And he didn't drink it.
*  Of course not.
*  Of course he didn't drink it.
*  Yeah, he's full of shit.
*  Talk the talk.
*  Talk the talk.
*  Yeah, talk is cheap, you fuck.
*  That glyphosate stuff.
*  It's like, look, weeds are supposed to be there, man.
*  They're supposed to grow along with everything else.
*  That's how it's supposed to work.
*  You can't decide what shit.
*  You're supposed to pluck those weeds.
*  That's what I was going to say.
*  Just pull them out.
*  Yeah, you fucking lazy bitch.
*  Thank God.
*  But if you have a garden, you can pluck your weeds.
*  But if you have a gigantic monocrop agriculture farm with 6,000 acres of corn or alfalfa or
*  some shit, you can't really.
*  Glyphosate or pluck it.
*  You gotta spray that bitch.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I just, whenever something happens like this coronavirus thing, I get worried about all
*  kinds of stuff.
*  I start worrying about all kinds of weird fucking toxins, chemicals.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what I always, I think about that all the time.
*  Do you?
*  I do.
*  Well, I grew up in the South, so I remember crop dusters flying over and I remember-
*  To kill mosquitoes, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, the mosquitoes and then the actual planes that would come over and just dump everything.
*  And then I look up and then I start thinking about chem trails.
*  And this is just a Tuesday.
*  And I think about that shit when it rains and then that stuff gets into the water supply
*  and then you're just like, oh, I got a Brita filter, but-
*  Is it really?
*  You know?
*  There's another yoga guy that I know that teaches yoga and he didn't know that you're
*  not supposed to swim in the ocean right after the rain.
*  What?
*  In Los Angeles, apparently, it's super dangerous to get in that ocean.
*  And pollute it.
*  Yeah, because all the runoff, because the way LA's system is, the LA River and all
*  that jazz, which is sort of a fake river.
*  It's not even a river at all.
*  And it's perfect for LA.
*  Calling the LA River the LA River, it is perfect when you look at it.
*  Like, oh yeah, it's fake.
*  It's perfect.
*  It's literally just a concrete stream.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's like a fucking gross drainage.
*  It's just enormous.
*  Well, when that bitch goes down into the ocean, it carries with it all the garbage, all the
*  chemicals, oil from the streets, all that stuff.
*  Needles.
*  And it's all in the water.
*  And so when you go surfing right after that, you get really fucking sick.
*  And he was telling me he got deathly ill because he just didn't know any better.
*  He was just out there.
*  And he's from Argentina, I guess, where it's not as much of an issue there.
*  And he was in that water.
*  He got fucked up.
*  He said he was he was a wreck for like two weeks.
*  Yeah, that'll knock you out.
*  I mean, if you're, that's just gross.
*  Just sewage stew.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Just floating around in it.
*  It's just weird that they decided to make the LA River like that.
*  I've never seen anything like that.
*  Look at the LA River.
*  That's why you're going to be full.
*  That's after a big storm.
*  That was this year?
*  No, that was last year.
*  January 19th.
*  OK.
*  Look at that motherfucker.
*  Ugh.
*  Just all condoms and poop.
*  I'm listening.
*  And fucking connery.
*  Well, that's what they did with the reservoir.
*  Don't they drain?
*  They had to drain it because it was filled with shit.
*  It was filled with shit and bodies and cars and stuff.
*  It's like, well.
*  Well, they say so many people are on antidepressants and SSRIs and all that jazz that the water
*  supply has a certain amount of it in it because people flush and they flush.
*  And apparently some of the water that we use is actually recycled.
*  They take your piss water and they turn it around.
*  Did you know that?
*  Nope, but now I do.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if it's everywhere.
*  Drinking pee.
*  But in some places, you're basically drinking recycled piss water.
*  Yeah.
*  Mmm.
*  Yummy.
*  Essentia.
*  It's basically an aqueduct, but it's like a big pipe that's like hundreds of miles
*  long.
*  That's how we get our water here.
*  I've actually seen it in person.
*  Someone walked it, I think, recently.
*  There's a video I saw.
*  I've seen it in person.
*  It's crazy.
*  I think it goes through Tajon Ranch.
*  It's an enormous pipe.
*  Yeah.
*  So what have we learned this Valentine's Day?
*  Everything's trash.
*  Is today Valentine's Day?
*  No, it's Friday.
*  Oh, this Friday.
*  I think, yeah.
*  We're not supposed to live that stacked on top of each other like that.
*  We're supposed to live in small villages in the woods with just enough food.
*  I'm down for that.
*  I want a tiny home.
*  Do you?
*  Yeah.
*  You want one of them little mobile things?
*  Yeah, a little tiny home in the woods.
*  Really?
*  With a fire pit out front.
*  Could you survive in the woods?
*  Probably not, but I have a lesbian friend.
*  Yeah.
*  Her name's Denise.
*  Lesbian friends are good.
*  Yeah.
*  The ones with those Patagonia vests.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Every carabiner.
*  I mean, she's on survival mode 24-7.
*  We have earthquake drills every day.
*  Yeah.
*  Really?
*  Not really.
*  Does she stay in your building?
*  She's in the building, yeah.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, she's my alpha.
*  Does she keep food?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Really?
*  Canned, preserves, yeah.
*  Storage.
*  You know you're going deep when you have that fucking preacher food.
*  You know that stuff like that Jim Baker was selling?
*  Oh, God.
*  Did you ever see that?
*  It makes sense, but it was just like, it's almost like spam, but can live for ...
*  It's like buckets of this gruel.
*  Bucket gruel.
*  In Jim Baker's show, he used it as the base of a table.
*  He's like, you could use it underneath your table.
*  This is how you could keep your kitchen table.
*  He's got stacks of this stuff, and then they were sitting on it.
*  You could use it as a stool.
*  Your house is filled with survivor food.
*  Yeah.
*  In case the shit goes down, it's everywhere in your house.
*  You just have to open up one of these buckets.
*  Did you ever see that video, Jamie?
*  Bucket gruel.
*  There's a smash cut video of it.
*  Right.
*  Who made the smash cut?
*  Vic Berger did.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  It's Vic Berger's smash cut.
*  It's fucking hilarious because Vic Berger makes a bunch of very funny internet videos
*  as it is, but as you're watching Jim Baker, and this is the same Jim Baker from the old
*  days when Jessica Hahn and he had ...
*  The fair.
*  The fair.
*  See, all this stuff is the shit he's selling.
*  This is stacked.
*  He's got it all up the stairs and shit.
*  It's stacked survival food.
*  You told me to do this.
*  Look at this.
*  Look at this.
*  They got shovels.
*  Shovel.
*  By the way, get a shovel.
*  These are foldable shovels.
*  It'll go in your backpack.
*  This is how you dig the living room.
*  Jim Baker, you ain't wearing a fucking backpack.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at these guys.
*  They're like, really?
*  So he was banging Jessica Hahn, and then Sam Kinison wound up banging Jessica Hahn.
*  And then, oh, look, he's just digging in there and eating it.
*  Look, you can eat it.
*  It's so good.
*  He's eating in handfuls.
*  What is that?
*  He's eating.
*  And he's coming out of his mouth into the bucket.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ, Jim.
*  Literally.
*  He looks weird.
*  Yeah.
*  He doesn't look like the same guy.
*  That's Tammy Faye's ex-husband.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  She's dead now.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't he too?
*  She died from diet coke.
*  Well, I think she had some of that new bulk sampler.
*  She died from diet coke?
*  I think they said she drank like 100 cans of diet coke a day, and she got brain cancer.
*  Yeah, southern people love that.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's what it looks like when it's cooked.
*  That will keep you alive, Justin Martindale.
*  Look at that.
*  Imagine eating that.
*  And you're fucking mixing all that together.
*  What's in there?
*  Diarrhea.
*  That's definitely what's in there.
*  Diarrhea and nacho cheese.
*  That's like queso from Texas.
*  No, how dare you, sir.
*  Real cheesy queso.
*  I miss Texas queso.
*  That's good.
*  I was just in Houston.
*  Where are you?
*  When?
*  I was there two weeks ago.
*  I was there two days ago.
*  Oh, okay.
*  I was there Saturday night for the UFC, Friday and Saturday.
*  But that kick, that was a good kick.
*  Which one?
*  I don't know their names.
*  The girl did that round off kick to the other one.
*  That was a couple months ago.
*  Oh, it was?
*  Yeah, that's Valentina Shevchenko.
*  I'm trying.
*  Yeah, she fought this weekend.
*  I'm going to get called a fag in all the comments now.
*  How dare they.
*  It's okay.
*  What is that cheese stuff though?
*  That cheese that's watery.
*  It's not really cheese.
*  What do they call it?
*  Government cheese.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  It's like you can squirtch it.
*  Squirtch it?
*  Easy cheese?
*  Yeah, but it's like...
*  Oh, Cheese Whiz.
*  Is it Cheese Whiz?
*  Is that what it is?
*  The one in the tube?
*  Yeah, it depends on which company you buy it from.
*  I don't think I'm thinking about that though.
*  There's a type of liquidy cheese that people would put on nachos and stuff like that.
*  Do you know what I'm talking about?
*  I don't...
*  It's not your cheese.
*  I don't fuck...
*  I've never known anything else.
*  But it's melted.
*  It's like liquidy cheese.
*  But that's what that Jim Baker gruel looks like.
*  That he was serving up people.
*  But that's a big thing with preachers, right?
*  They always want to prepare you for the apocalypse with food.
*  Yeah, because they're confident.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what they do.
*  Well, it's like I don't want to be a prepper, but I think you probably should have some
*  food at your house.
*  Yeah.
*  You should be ready for a couple of weeks.
*  I know.
*  You should be ready for a couple of weeks.
*  And they have these things where you fill your bathtub up.
*  It's like a bladder that you put in your bathtub and then you fill your bathtub up with water
*  so you always have water.
*  Because if the shit goes down, if it really lasts for a couple of weeks, you're going
*  to need some water.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  It's really going to make sense.
*  I just have bags of boxed wine in my fridge.
*  That'll help.
*  I'm ready to go.
*  Listen, people used to live off wine.
*  Yeah.
*  They call it travel, prevent travelers disease because they kill everything.
*  Because if you get water from a lake, right, like that water's got all kinds of garbage
*  in it, right?
*  Like if you get water from a lake, you're drinking a bunch of different bacteria and
*  parasites and different.
*  I mean, even if it's a clear lake, you're really not supposed to drink the water unless
*  you're above a certain altitude.
*  Like I was in Alaska and I was with these guys and we were hunting and they told us
*  we could drink this water because above 8,000 feet or whatever, beavers don't live.
*  That's what you have to worry about.
*  You have to worry about beaver fever.
*  Of course they did.
*  They call it beaver fever.
*  It's Giardia.
*  It's a different beaver fever than guys get at clubs.
*  It's a different beaver fever.
*  Or Denise, yeah.
*  Or Denise.
*  She get that beaver fever.
*  Always.
*  Just a polished upper Patagonia jacket.
*  Put it on your best patchouli.
*  A little bit behind the ears will do you.
*  Little musk.
*  Why is it that lesbians have never been able to form a proper neighborhood, but gay guys
*  can do it in almost every town?
*  Hmm.
*  I feel like gay guys push the lesbians out.
*  You think so?
*  Lesbians are smarter because they'll form their own tribe.
*  Yeah, but they never develop like, like Boys Town is legendary, right?
*  It's like, it's, it is.
*  It's a gay, five blocks of gay, right?
*  I call it home.
*  That's your spot.
*  But if you think about it, there's no lesbian equivalent anywhere on earth that I know of.
*  Is there like a legitimate lesbian community where it's only lesbians and they get together
*  and do lesbian things and wear cowboy hats and G-strings and shit?
*  Yeah, they have their own.
*  I mean, that's the thing.
*  I feel like guys are more, they want to be in charge more where lesbians can kind of
*  just form their own little side neighborhoods.
*  They don't need the credit.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But do they?
*  No, I feel like people would know there's a, like a legit lesbian neighborhood, like
*  Girl's Town.
*  People would know.
*  But would you want to go to Girl's Town?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Why is, I think that's the problem.
*  That's the thing.
*  I think guys go there and they ruin it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I'm an ally and they move next door and they just fucking act like, can I help you
*  with your trash?
*  You want to fuck away from me?
*  Exactly.
*  Are you sure you're gay?
*  Yeah.
*  They get that a lot.
*  There's a lot of like little organizations.
*  I have lesbian friends that do a thing called Babes on Bikes where they like, it's like
*  Motorcycles?
*  Motorcycles.
*  Yeah.
*  And they go travel and
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  And they go hiking and camping and all that stuff.
*  Would it be fair to compare lesbians to cats and gay folks to dogs, gay men to dogs?
*  Dogs like to congregate in packs.
*  No, I'm going to reverse it.
*  But dogs like to be in packs.
*  I know, but dogs are loyal.
*  No, they're not.
*  Not sex.
*  Well, I don't know how many dogs you're fucking.
*  Dogs will fucking hump your leg.
*  Then they'll hump Jamie's leg.
*  Oh, that's true.
*  Yeah, they'll fuck everything.
*  But I feel like cats will just be, cats will just like, ugh, and they'll just get out of
*  here.
*  That's true too.
*  Very temperamental, very sociopathic.
*  But they don't like to live in like a big pack.
*  Like the lesbians.
*  Does this make sense?
*  That does make sense.
*  I think I'm onto something.
*  Yeah, I'm going to lose sleep tonight.
*  I think people always say men are dogs.
*  But dogs are loyal.
*  They're loyal.
*  But men are loyal.
*  They're just not that loyal sexually.
*  Right.
*  But they're loyal to each other.
*  Good friends.
*  My best friends are all men.
*  I mean, I have girl, female friends.
*  But if I need some shit, if I need like, I'm calling Brian Callan, like I'm calling a male
*  friend, you know, there's a difference.
*  I think.
*  Gay guys are probably dogs and lesbians are wolves.
*  Whoa.
*  Dude, that's dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  Them wolves are circling.
*  They eat dogs.
*  You've got your alphas and your betas and they all just know their place.
*  Wolves eat dogs, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think lesbians eat gay guys?
*  Oh, totally.
*  Every day.
*  In fact, five are being eaten right now as we speak.
*  Viciously.
*  Have you ever heard of a lesbian and a gay guy getting together and deciding they're
*  both straight?
*  Yeah, they're in the south.
*  It's called conversion therapy.
*  Does that work?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Is it any works on anybody?
*  I feel like that was in a documentary somewhere where it was like, well, you have like a,
*  yeah, pray the gateway.
*  It's like, I met my beautiful wife.
*  Oh, right.
*  She was a lesbian and I was a gay man.
*  And then it like cuts to him tapping his shoe under a bathroom stall.
*  Yeah.
*  That's sad shit, man.
*  It is weird.
*  It's just brainwashing.
*  Well, it's just weird because those guys that do it.
*  I read an article about this man who went sort of undercover to one of these pray the
*  gateway camps.
*  He was talking about this counselor who was literally sitting behind him, like holding
*  him during this ceremony with a boner.
*  The guy had a boner pressed up against his butt.
*  You could feel the guy's boner and he's like, what in the fucking Sam Hill?
*  Yeah, the Sam Hill.
*  I always want to say that.
*  What in the Sam Hill?
*  Thanks, Sean Elliott.
*  What in the Sam Hill?
*  It's the new porn parody of Tombstone, Tombbone.
*  That's sad shit though, man.
*  It's still a thing.
*  Well, it would be just for men that aren't gay to understand what it was like.
*  Imagine if there was like gay conversion therapy where people were saying like, God wants you
*  to be gay and you've got to stop hooking up on all these ladies and we're going to get
*  together and we're just going to pray that gay into you.
*  We're going to put on some Moulin Rouge soundtrack.
*  We're going to all dress up like Cher.
*  Dim the lights.
*  Lock the doors.
*  And we're going to get this party started.
*  It's a ruthless thing, man.
*  It's a weird thing that for whatever reason, society has, it's taken so long, particularly
*  in this country, for people to accept it.
*  That this is still up for debate with some people whether or not gay people should be
*  allowed to be married.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  Did you see the woman of the, God, it went viral.
*  It was a lady who was a pro Pete Buttigieg for president.
*  And then she was like, what, he's gay?
*  Oh well, no.
*  Do you see if you can find that?
*  Can you find that?
*  Can we play it or will we get in trouble?
*  You probably can't play it.
*  Why would you get in trouble?
*  We'll get pulled off of YouTube.
*  There's copyrights on those so they own the clip and so they want other people to go to
*  their page to have the clip so we put it on our page.
*  We need to pray the copyright away.
*  That's what we need to do.
*  She was like, what?
*  He's what?
*  He's gay.
*  Give me that fucking vote back.
*  Get out of here.
*  I had a woman, God, what was this?
*  I was doing a gig somewhere out of town and afterwards we had the meet and greet and she
*  came up and she's like, I really thought you were really funny.
*  And I was like, thank you.
*  She's like, I didn't even care if you were gay.
*  I'm like, okay.
*  I didn't even care.
*  I still laughed.
*  My job is done.
*  I still laugh.
*  I still laugh.
*  And that's always how I've been.
*  It's disgusting.
*  Yeah.
*  And you made me laugh through that.
*  So congratulations.
*  Well, I don't talk about it.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't define who I am.
*  Right.
*  It shouldn't.
*  No.
*  I just can't believe that it's still such an issue.
*  Unless we're trying to fuck you, what do you care?
*  Why do you care?
*  Yeah.
*  The most interesting thing about Pete Buttigieg is that it's not that he's gay.
*  That's the least interesting thing about him.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a very basic gay.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just very...
*  But it's like, that's what the reason why he's the guy is because he checks a lot of
*  these progressive boxes and he's also got a shitload of people donating to him.
*  Here it is.
*  He's married to him.
*  What?
*  He has a same sex partner?
*  Look at her.
*  Look, she looks like a woodchuck.
*  She should be concerned about her diabetes.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  I don't want anybody like that in the White House.
*  Yeah.
*  But also, this is what breaks my heart is this woman's clearly doing her job and then
*  she has her son with her and she's like, no, but I'm raising my son to be open-minded
*  because I'm a Christian as well and love is love and that's what we need more of is when
*  people cherry pick the Bible like a Jim Baker who's like, you know, or even our amazing
*  Christian commander in chief.
*  Why is it saying the Bible that my husband married a woman then?
*  I totally respect that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just sad.
*  It's just like, in the Bible it says this and it's like, well, in the Bible it says...
*  You can always counter, go against what the Bible says from a different verse.
*  It's like it doesn't say to eat shrimp or pork or anything like that, but I'll see half
*  these people at a Chili's buffet just going to town.
*  Yeah, eating a lot of shellfish.
*  You imagine if you got all the way up to heaven and God was like, look, I don't care about
*  guys fucking guys.
*  All that clams.
*  You guys are assholes.
*  It says in the fucking Bible, don't eat clams.
*  Why'd you eat clams?
*  Did you read what I said?
*  I'm already grown.
*  I couldn't help myself.
*  Why are you wearing two different kinds of cloth?
*  You don't wear two different kinds of cloth.
*  I know.
*  That's in the fucking Bible.
*  And that's the gayest thing too.
*  Like if God, if I did my whole job on earth and I got to heaven and God was like, girl,
*  two kinds of cloth.
*  I'm like, wait, what?
*  No.
*  Back to hell you go.
*  Wait.
*  Well, also the Bible's clearly seen the hand of man.
*  I'm sure there was probably some things that people had figured out, whether it's from
*  psychedelic experiences or what have you, that they had, there's some core tenants.
*  We should treat each other as if, you know, these are our brothers and sisters.
*  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
*  Don't steal, don't murder.
*  All that stuff we can keep together and live in peace.
*  And then people got a hold of it.
*  Exactly.
*  They got their greasy little mitts on it.
*  I think the shellfish and the cloven hoof shit, like with pork, like that is in the Torah
*  or the...
*  What a great word, cloven hoof.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you're not an animal with a cloven hoof that eats its cud.
*  They're like pork.
*  You're not supposed to eat pork.
*  But that's probably because they had trichinosis.
*  But this woman sows, she's a witch.
*  And what the fuck happened with Noah?
*  How did Noah, like, what was he doing up there?
*  He was doing drugs.
*  In the ark?
*  No.
*  I mean, for sure.
*  He was doing drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  They were all doing drugs.
*  Moses was doing drugs.
*  They were all doing drugs.
*  I guarantee you.
*  I think that's probably the root of most of these religious experiences.
*  Those guys found mushrooms, they were tripping balls, they came back with some really loosely
*  put together commandment that they got from God.
*  Like Moses, when he came down from the mountain in Jerusalem, the Jerusalem scholars now believe
*  that the burning bush that talked to God or talked to Moses was the acacia tree, which
*  is a tree that's rich in DMT.
*  So they believe this thing of a burning bush was actually them smoking this plant and having
*  these psychedelic experiences.
*  And talking to it.
*  And talking to God.
*  Word!
*  Makes sense, right?
*  That's cool.
*  What about Job in the whale?
*  That's always confused me.
*  It's a good one, right?
*  Yeah, 40, or was it 40 days in the belly of a whale?
*  Maybe Job's full of shit.
*  How about that?
*  I would think so.
*  Maybe Job was like, you know, like a beloved guy and everybody's like, I don't want to
*  believe he's lying to me.
*  Jonah was the...
*  Oh, Jonah.
*  Jonah in the whale.
*  Who's Job?
*  What did Job do?
*  He had something to do with working.
*  Oh, he's a worker.
*  He has his own book.
*  It's the book of Job.
*  See, grew up in the South, didn't pay attention to Bible class, I'm sorry.
*  And look how I turned out.
*  I lived in a large family.
*  He had a large family?
*  Oh, great story.
*  And then the woman...
*  And then Lot's wife, when she turned around and turned into salt?
*  Sure.
*  Well, she fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  She fucked up.
*  That was her fault.
*  Well, how about, I mean, listen, how about Adam and Eve?
*  How weird is that one?
*  And Lilith.
*  That dirty bitch wanted to eat that apple.
*  She did.
*  And she didn't want to listen.
*  Which they said the apple was a pomegranate?
*  They said the apple could have been a pomegranate, yeah, because it's the fruit of life because
*  it has so many antioxidants in it.
*  There's another theory that the apple is actually, the term apple is actually based on the color
*  red and that it actually represented the Ammonita muscaria mushroom, which was the mushroom
*  that they believe Christianity was based on in the first place.
*  There's a book called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by a guy named John Marco Allegro,
*  who is an ordained minister.
*  Yeah, see that?
*  What?
*  That is an original fresco from some France.
*  See, it is 13th century fresco depicting Adam and Eve in a tree of knowledge.
*  So that's mushrooms.
*  And that mushroom is a mushroom called the Ammonita muscaria.
*  The Ammonita muscaria is a really cool looking mushroom that you can find...
*  I found one in Colorado recently.
*  What?
*  Colorado?
*  They're growing.
*  Wow, are they big like that?
*  Yeah, they're tall.
*  Well, those obviously are exaggerated.
*  Those are really tall.
*  No, it's the Bible.
*  Nothing's exaggerated.
*  Stop it.
*  That's really cool.
*  I never even thought about that.
*  Yeah, the sacred mushroom and the cross, go to the cover of the sacred mushroom and the
*  cross, you can see the image of this mushroom and you realize like, oh, that thing looks
*  a lot like Santa Claus.
*  It's red and white.
*  And there's a lot of weird parallels with Santa Claus.
*  The mushroom grows under coniferous trees, like pine trees.
*  What?
*  There's a mycorrhizal relationship with coniferous trees and it grows almost instantaneously.
*  And that looks like a pomegranate.
*  It does, sure.
*  I mean, it looks like an apple too.
*  It does.
*  Yeah.
*  So that book is a really weird book.
*  It's hard to follow.
*  It's really complicated.
*  book is essentially saying, this guy, John Marco Allegro, he studied the Dead Sea Scrolls
*  for 14 years and his conclusion after, he was one of the people that was on the committee
*  to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls from Aramaic to English.
*  And after 14 years, his conclusion was that the entire Christian religion was a gigantic
*  misunderstanding and what it really was about was the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms
*  and fertility rituals.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Which pagan.
*  Take it all back to paganism, which we're not supposed to celebrate, but we are.
*  But we are.
*  Christmas is a pagan holiday.
*  They had to move a bunch of the holidays to coincide with pagan holidays just to get pagan
*  people on board.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what was, which blew my mind, it came out like 10 years ago, was that Zeitgeist
*  video about Christmas and everything and Jesus and everything.
*  And I was just like, whoa, I had no idea.
*  Check that out.
*  Yeah.
*  We have it.
*  That's really good.
*  When you stop and think about how long people have been telling the story of Jesus and how
*  weird it's gotten over the years and how many times it's been distorted and twisted and
*  changed and turned from ancient Hebrew, I mean the original Bible, the Old Testament,
*  ancient Hebrew, and then they converted it to Latin and Greek and then English and then
*  the New Testament and then, ugh.
*  It's so hard.
*  And then God's going to punish you and bring you to hell if you don't follow these words.
*  But they're all so screwy.
*  You're supposed to believe in all this nonsense, like people coming back from the dead.
*  There's John Marker Olegro.
*  So the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in, it's a crazy story, because they were found in
*  Qumran, which is in Israel, and they found them in these caves and they were in these
*  clay pots and they were made out of animal skins.
*  They were written on animal skins.
*  And they actually had to do DNA tests on the animal skin so they could line up the pieces
*  with the ones that were from the same animal so they can make this sort of assumption that
*  this all was one piece, because a lot of it was all broken up.
*  So they had to put it all back together again and try to figure out what it all meant.
*  And he came up with this one theory that the word Christ, it comes from an ancient Sumerian
*  word, which means a mushroom covered in God's semen.
*  What?
*  Yes.
*  Not semen.
*  It's cum.
*  It's a cum shroom?
*  The rain was cum.
*  Oh, man.
*  The rain was like God's semen and then these mushrooms would come out of the ground right
*  after the rain, right?
*  Because you've seen, like, when it rains, the next day these mushrooms are huge.
*  Yeah, they're massive.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they eat them, they trip balls, and they think that it's coming from God.
*  And so all the stories in the Bible were essentially about them trying to hide these mushroom
*  rituals in allegories and parables and all these different stories that made sense to
*  them but wouldn't make sense to their conquerors like the Romans.
*  Whoa.
*  Bro.
*  Because I mean, I feel like if after a big rainstorm, because those mushrooms pop out
*  of the ground really fast.
*  So they probably, they don't have TV, they don't have Instagram.
*  Exactly.
*  So they're probably like, whoa, these weren't here like two days ago.
*  Let's try them out.
*  Well, have you ever talked to Duncan Trussell about when he used to live in Asheville?
*  No.
*  When he used to live in Asheville, they'd actually spray things on the manure to keep
*  the mushrooms from growing.
*  Because so many psilocybin mushrooms grew in the manure out there.
*  And they even like added things to the cow's diet and they were trying everything to kill
*  these mushrooms.
*  Because these college kids, Duncan, Duncan Trussell and his buddies would go out to the
*  fields and there would be fucking mushrooms everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Because, you know, Asheville, North Carolina is like a great environment.
*  Yeah, humid.
*  Yeah.
*  Moist and everything's green and lush.
*  These cows just fucking lay turds and these mushrooms would grow out of them.
*  And they would all, these kids would trip balls.
*  Yeah.
*  And Duncan talks with great fondness of his college days, just going out into the fields
*  and finding mushrooms and they would all just trip their fucking balls.
*  Just sit out in the field and do it.
*  And it came, like overnight, like it rains.
*  And then the next day you go out in the morning and there's like fucking five pounds of mushrooms
*  just floating around.
*  Good times.
*  Good times.
*  That's next.
*  That's next for decriminalization.
*  Mushrooms?
*  Yeah, that's next.
*  They're going to make that happen.
*  They're going to make it happen.
*  It's already decriminalized in Colorado.
*  My friend, Sean Evans, was here yesterday.
*  He was talking about it.
*  I think they're going to pull that off in California as well.
*  They have to.
*  They just like, just even from micro dosing, if we could just get everyone to micro dose,
*  the world would be so much better.
*  I feel like that's the new trend right now.
*  I hear that all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Everyone's just like, I just micro dose.
*  I just micro dose.
*  I've done it a bunch of times.
*  I know somebody who micro doses acid.
*  I'm like, shit.
*  A lot of guys in Silicon Valley do.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  They think it keeps all their negative chatter at bay.
*  I had a buddy of mine who was just here the other day, micro doses.
*  He says he takes it every three or four days.
*  Acid?
*  No, no, no.
*  Mushrooms.
*  Like the little capsules?
*  The little pills?
*  Yeah.
*  They grind it up.
*  They grind up the mushrooms and he'll take one capsule every three or four days and he
*  said it just keeps negativity out of his head, keeps him positive, keeps him healthy.
*  See, that makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like that's what they did with weed.
*  I just feel like, especially now in California, I just feel like more people are just kind
*  of chill with it.
*  I just remember, I can't even go back to back in the day of like, I got a joint, let's go
*  smoke it in the car.
*  Shut up, shut up.
*  Hold on, the car's driving by.
*  Especially if you were traveling.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Joey Diaz, there's a famous film of we went to Austin, Texas and Joey Diaz used to hide
*  the weed under his balls and he's on the Alex Jones show talking about how he hides weed
*  under his balls.
*  And it's there now?
*  It's probably stuck there somewhere, he probably forgot about it.
*  But he used to, that's what he used to do, he used to take a little baggie, put his weed
*  in the baggie, zip it up and tuck it under his balls in his underwear.
*  God, that's crazy.
*  Yeah, you had to be careful.
*  I knew guys that would put it in coffee.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And now you just have a bag of gummies and you're like whatever.
*  They don't even know what it is, I mean how many people are vapers?
*  Or a vape pen.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It's like, ah, it's a vape pen, oh, very cool.
*  They don't check, they don't give a fuck.
*  They're just looking for bombs.
*  And as it spreads across the country, the legality, I think it's legal, state legal
*  in what, nine states?
*  Something like that, yeah.
*  And then medically legal in like 18 or something.
*  Let's find out.
*  How many states?
*  Jamie, let's try.
*  Siri.
*  Alexa.
*  I'm going to say nine states legal, 18 states medical.
*  Okay.
*  Is that right, Jamie?
*  Let's find out.
*  I think.
*  Look at that, oh shit.
*  All those green?
*  The dark is legal.
*  The dark is legal, yeah.
*  And all the other ones are what, medical?
*  Yeah.
*  So everything's medical?
*  Well, Texas isn't.
*  I don't think Texas is.
*  What is Texas?
*  Go to Texas.
*  Go to Texas.
*  Texas, get to Texas.
*  The light green is nothing.
*  Medical, CBD oil.
*  CBD, yeah.
*  Decriminalized, no.
*  Well, at least they can get CBD.
*  Look, CBD is the gateway because that shit is so good for you.
*  CBD is the gateway.
*  It is the gateway.
*  I know.
*  They have it in everything now.
*  Hand cream, eye drops.
*  Medical, yes.
*  Medical, no.
*  Decriminalized, no.
*  So the light ones are what?
*  Go to light ones.
*  Fully illegal.
*  What's Tennessee?
*  That's Tennessee.
*  Might have family in Tennessee.
*  What are they?
*  Fully bullshit.
*  Yeah, Tennessee.
*  The light ones are fully bullshit.
*  We get to sneak around in Tennessee.
*  What is up in those green ones up north?
*  That's Maine.
*  What is the squares?
*  The squares, the light ones down.
*  Oh, the yellowish ones, yeah.
*  What is that?
*  Wyoming.
*  No medical, no decriminalized.
*  What is the one next to Wyoming?
*  What is that state?
*  Right next to, left.
*  Left.
*  Idaho.
*  Idaho.
*  No.
*  Yeah, see?
*  That's how they keep people out.
*  Because Colorado, man, when they made it legal in Colorado, fucking everybody moved there.
*  Yeah, they did.
*  Colorado, boom.
*  Of course.
*  Real estate jumped tremendously.
*  They started making a shitload of money.
*  I think Hawaii's got it weird, too.
*  It's mixed.
*  Yeah, what does it say?
*  Medicinal, yes.
*  Mixed, medicinal.
*  Decriminalized laws.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So it's reduced penalty.
*  And then Alaska is free, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Legal, powerful friends in Alaska.
*  God, that's crazy.
*  It is crazy.
*  But look, just what we're looking at there, Massachusetts legal, Maine legal, Vermont
*  legal.
*  What is that, Illinois?
*  Is New Hampshire still illegal?
*  What is New Hampshire?
*  Mixed, medicinal, and then reduced penalty.
*  They don't really care.
*  They're like Austin.
*  They're just like, man, we're in Texas, but we're cool.
*  But New Hampshire's weird because that's supposed to be live free.
*  Like, they're bumper stickers.
*  They're license-free.
*  Live free or die hard?
*  No.
*  Live free or die trying.
*  Live free or die.
*  Yeah.
*  And Florida is what, medical?
*  So there's really only a few backwoods states.
*  Well, Florida bath salts are fine.
*  So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
*  DC thing's always weird because it's fully legal in DC.
*  And that's not a state or a thing.
*  That's the federal government city, but it's not legal.
*  Get that cursor off the state so I can count them.
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
*  Twelve states fully legal.
*  Twelve are legal.
*  So what'd you say, nine?
*  I said nine.
*  So twelve.
*  That's good.
*  That's progressive.
*  Yeah.
*  It's nice.
*  But I feel like it's an election year.
*  Are you putting it on the ballot to legalize it maybe?
*  Well, there's a picture of Burt Kreischer taking his shirt off in the green room.
*  I know, crazy.
*  That's nuts.
*  I've never heard of such a thing.
*  But it was the moment that weed became legal in California.
*  Burt stripped his shirt off and started running around on stage.
*  We were doing an end of the world podcast in the green room or in the main room in 2016
*  when Trump was elected.
*  That was a weird night.
*  That was a weird night.
*  I remember where I was.
*  I was at the improv that night.
*  Because we were supposed to be doing a show and it was like a...
*  That's right.
*  You guys were all on stage at that table.
*  That's right.
*  We did a live podcast.
*  It was like you, Sarah Tiana.
*  It should have been the Bill Burr show.
*  Because Bill Burr was on fire.
*  He was roasting everybody.
*  That was crazy.
*  It was amazing.
*  It was a nut.
*  I remember we were at the improv watching the election happen and all of a sudden everyone
*  was going red, red, red.
*  And someone looked at me and was like, are we in trouble?
*  I'm like, oh yeah, we're totally fucked.
*  Well, people didn't think it was coming.
*  They had this idea.
*  Well, people have these ideas of what's good and what's not good, what's going to happen
*  and not going to...
*  Which brings me back to this Mayor Pete guy.
*  They came up with that guy because they said, look, here he is.
*  He's a young, handsome guy.
*  He's gay.
*  He's a mayor.
*  He speaks well.
*  I think he's a veteran.
*  He's served in the military.
*  Yeah.
*  So like this will be the guy.
*  But he's also backed by all these billionaires.
*  It's a fucking...
*  It's a shell game.
*  What do you mean?
*  He's got a wine cave.
*  Leave him alone.
*  He's got a wine cave?
*  What does that mean?
*  Like Elizabeth Warren said something like he had this fundraiser and a wine cave?
*  Like yeah, it was like all these rich billionaires.
*  It was like a cave.
*  What is it called?
*  A wine cellar, but it happened to be a cave somewhere out here in California.
*  They're just trying really hard to keep it from being Bernie, really hard.
*  They don't want Bernie Sanders.
*  If he gets in there...
*  Apparently, he was an independent for so long and he doesn't want to play ball and he doesn't
*  accept any money.
*  Doesn't accept any money.
*  He's just like the cool grandpa.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, shit, I love Bernie.
*  You know why?
*  Because he...
*  Like you could say, oh, happy Martin Luther King Day.
*  But then you look at an old picture of him and he's marching next to Martin Luther King
*  for civil rights.
*  That's amazing.
*  You can't be like, no.
*  Where were you?
*  Right.
*  You know?
*  It's like, I just...
*  I don't know.
*  I have hope.
*  I have hope for somebody just to...
*  I have hope for him socially.
*  I like what he stands for socially.
*  But then you look at...
*  I don't know if economically it's feasible because I don't understand economics.
*  When people start talking about...
*  When he was on here, he was describing that if they just took a very small amount of money
*  from every transaction that they do, like less than one cent from every transaction
*  that Wall Street does, that it would add up to more than enough money to pay for healthcare
*  and a lot of other things.
*  School.
*  He was explaining it all.
*  And he was explaining it very calmly and it didn't seem like he was bullshitting.
*  I don't think he is a bullshitter.
*  I don't think he's a bullshitter.
*  I think he's been in the game for years.
*  He knows how it works.
*  No, he's not a bullshitter.
*  He knows how these people with money work, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's...
*  Funding and...
*  It's just a...
*  It's such a weird upheaval politically.
*  Things don't make 100% sense anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  I have no...
*  I actually had a friend of mine ask me, he says, because we got our voter registration
*  because we vote March 3rd here.
*  So they're like, who are you going to pick?
*  I'm like, I don't know.
*  I mean, we're going to go blue anyways, but it's just like, I honestly don't know.
*  It looks like Bernie Sanders is going to be the nominee.
*  For...
*  It looks like he's winning in New Hampshire.
*  It looks like he...
*  Are they saying he won in Iowa or not?
*  No, I think Pete did.
*  He bullshitted.
*  He beat him by 6,000 votes.
*  It's so creepy.
*  But Pete beat him in a dance-off, so...
*  Oh, did he?
*  Did he get down?
*  Get down.
*  I would love to see Pete just...
*  Give him more coin flips.
*  Remember that?
*  Oh, that's right.
*  How about that fake coin flip?
*  They robbed that coin.
*  Whoever that is that did that coin flip, put that kid in a jail cell.
*  You son of a bitch.
*  Did you see that coin flip?
*  No, I want to see the coin flip.
*  The coin flip's hilariously rigged.
*  Was this in Iowa?
*  Yeah, hilariously rigged.
*  Watch the coin flip.
*  Hold on.
*  Do it from the beginning.
*  Watch this.
*  Watch how bad this coin flip is.
*  Go full screen.
*  Go full screen, please.
*  And do it from the beginning.
*  Watch this.
*  Flips it, catches it, look, pulls it so he can see, and then turns it over.
*  Hey, fuck you.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Hey, fuck you.
*  And no one said anything?
*  Oh, they're all happy.
*  Yay, it's Mayor Pete.
*  Look, yay.
*  That's what they wanted.
*  They wanted it to be Mayor Pete.
*  So this dude rigged this coin flip in front of the whole world.
*  Watch this.
*  Pulls it, looks at it.
*  Okay, how shall I flip it?
*  I'll do it like that.
*  Horseshit.
*  That's not how you do a coin flip, goddammit.
*  At all.
*  At all.
*  Iowa learned a coin flip.
*  Imagine if you were betting $100 with that guy.
*  He said, oh, I'll bet you $100.
*  He's like, okay, I'll flip a coin.
*  It's, oh, I win.
*  What do you mean you win?
*  You fucked.
*  You rigged it.
*  Look at that.
*  What is his jacket?
*  What is the patch?
*  I'm a cunt.
*  It says I'm a cunt.
*  Cunt force.
*  I'm a thieving cunt.
*  The cunt force.
*  Who's really bad at coin flips.
*  I love that woman who's like every mom in Iowa like, I'm proud of my son.
*  How's that old guy watching right next to me?
*  Hey, you fucked.
*  That's not how you flip a coin.
*  What country are you from?
*  What kind of nonsense is that?
*  That's what we need more of.
*  It's just people calling out bullshit.
*  Yeah, is that how you do it in Greenland?
*  Because that's not how you do it in America.
*  You don't get to look at the coin and flip it over to the other side, you asshole.
*  Look at it.
*  He looked at it and he turned it.
*  Like manipulated it with his hands.
*  He's also like, do it again.
*  Just do it again.
*  Yeah.
*  Here's how you do it.
*  Flip that bitch.
*  Let it land on the ground.
*  Let it land on the fucker.
*  Everybody back up.
*  So they're doing football?
*  Yes.
*  And I know that.
*  Yes.
*  Flip that bitch.
*  Imagine if they did that at the fucking NFL.
*  They would beat that guy to death.
*  So much money on that too.
*  But yet this is literally could change politics.
*  Like one way or the other.
*  If Bernie gets it or if Mayor Pete gets it, the delegates, it could all add up to one
*  guy or, I mean, it could go down to the wire.
*  I mean, that's bullshit.
*  Creep.
*  The whole thing's bullshit.
*  Bullshit.
*  What are the comments?
*  Oh, they went off on them.
*  Of course they did.
*  But this is what they did to Bernie Sanders in 2016.
*  The DNC rigged the primaries then.
*  They don't want him and they're doing it now.
*  Because he's.
*  Because he can't.
*  He won't work with them.
*  He's not corrupt.
*  Yeah.
*  They want someone who takes that money.
*  They don't want Tulsi and they don't want Bernie.
*  They pushed them out.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  They effectively eliminated them as threats.
*  Slow, but they can't.
*  Bernie's got too much grassroots behind them.
*  But who do you think, say if he gets the nomination, who do you think he'll pick as vice?
*  If he picks Tulsi, he'll be smart.
*  Two of them together would be a dynamic team.
*  What if he picked AOC?
*  No, she's too young.
*  She's only 28.
*  She can't be president.
*  She could be vice, no?
*  You don't think so?
*  You have to be 36 to be president.
*  If he gets shot in the head, then what happens?
*  Oh, God.
*  Sorry.
*  I mean.
*  They probably would.
*  I mean, if he caused Wall Street billions of dollars in losses, it could be real ugly
*  for him.
*  I don't think they're going to shoot him.
*  They're definitely poisoning him.
*  You have to be 35 to be vice president.
*  Yeah.
*  She's too young.
*  She's 28?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's why she says things that don't totally make sense sometimes.
*  Well, we all do.
*  But one of the things she said, it's impossible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps in this
*  By the shoelaces?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I saw that.
*  But here's why that's not correct.
*  She used to be a waitress.
*  Now she's a congresswoman.
*  She's literally living proof that you can.
*  You can pull yourself up from the bootstraps.
*  She just works hard.
*  She worked hard.
*  I understand what she's saying.
*  She's talking about working families that are really poor and that have multiple jobs
*  and that are struggling and they're never going to be rich.
*  They're never going to be wealthy.
*  They're never going to be middle class.
*  She's right in that regard.
*  There's a lot of people that because of their circumstances, because of their responsibilities,
*  they can't take any chances.
*  They can't do the things that she did.
*  She's young and single.
*  She's right in that way.
*  But I don't see I have a twisted relationship with this whole idea of democratic socialism.
*  I'm 100% in favor, like me personally, of paying more taxes if I really felt it was
*  going to make an impact for the better of humanity.
*  If it was going to improve schools for kids that live in bad neighborhoods, if it was
*  going to develop community centers in bad neighborhoods, it was going to provide better
*  health care for people.
*  I'm all in for that.
*  I just don't trust the government, meaning I don't trust the kind of people that you
*  would give that money to and then they would allocate it however they would, the way they'd
*  like to do.
*  I just don't know if they're efficient.
*  I don't know if they're reasonable.
*  I just, most people that work in government, like I don't know if they have the capability
*  of change on a large scale or if they're already so compromised in so many different ways that
*  it would just be throwing money away.
*  Right, right.
*  Did you see the video with, I don't know when it came out.
*  It's Adam Carolla sat down with Tucker Carlson.
*  Did you see that?
*  What did they talk about?
*  They talked about California.
*  They talked about the homeless epidemic that's here in California and how, I'm going to try
*  and quote it right, how he says the government just kind of looks a blind eye because we
*  are a city and a state that lives on permits and parking and licenses and we just want
*  that money.
*  So it's like if he says something, you know, forest law and memorial, like how you look
*  across the way and there's all these, you know, immigrants and whatnot, like selling
*  flowers, you know, but like a woman driving without a license plate, she'll get pulled
*  over and charged, but all these other people, it was kind of interesting and I hate saying,
*  I hate being like, oh, Tucker Carlson, but it was just, it was actually a really interesting
*  interview.
*  That's probably a good point.
*  California would care about the homeless if we could get money from them.
*  And on the way over here too, I was just looking at all these tents and it's just so fucking
*  sad.
*  It's so sad.
*  It's really sad and it keeps growing.
*  It keeps growing.
*  It's Hollywood.
*  And I remember like a couple of years ago, because, you know, it went from downtown and
*  then downtown pushes them all out.
*  So they keep going west, keep going west.
*  Some go to the beach, some go to Santa Monica.
*  But now it's like, I live in an area that, you know, six, seven years ago it was, it
*  was fine.
*  But now it's like even on the way to go get coffee this morning, I walk everywhere I go.
*  It's like, I saw like three, three homeless people just outside, just screaming at nothing.
*  You know, they're in tattered clothes and they're dirty and they're, you know, I
*  used to work with a girl years ago at a restaurant when I waited tables and she's now homeless
*  and she's like out of her mind.
*  And I feel bad.
*  Was she always out of her mind?
*  No, no.
*  She, you know, her name was Lotus.
*  You know, she did yoga and now.
*  What happened?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  Did you try to talk to her?
*  I did.
*  It was like, I got to watch the progression of the illness.
*  Yes.
*  So I would see her every now and then I was like, Hey, what's going on?
*  Because like back when the recession happened, you know, we were rating tables.
*  So we bounced from job to job because one day we'd go to work and there'd be chains
*  on the door because they couldn't pay us.
*  So we had this little kind of group that we would go apply together at different jobs.
*  And then I started seeing her out on the street and just walking around and I was like, Hey,
*  what's going on?
*  Hope you're doing well.
*  And she just kind of never let me know how she was really doing.
*  And then like a couple of years would go by and I'd see her and I'm like, she looks a
*  little out of it.
*  And I would say hi to her and she wouldn't respond.
*  And then now it's full on like teeth are missing and running down the street crying.
*  And it just breaks my heart because it's like, I don't know what to do.
*  And I don't know if she would be willing or how tight were you with her?
*  I mean, you had her phone number.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  I don't I mean, I don't even know she has a phone.
*  I can't.
*  But did you at one point in time?
*  I think so.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like, it's just that like inner guilt.
*  And you're just like, God, how did it get so bad?
*  She had an apartment, you know, I think her parents passed away and that might have like
*  set her, you know, spiraling.
*  But yeah, I remember just like doing a spot at the Laugh Factory one night and walking
*  outside and you know how everyone they just keep everyone outside like you do.
*  And she just like barreled through everybody just screaming nonsense and like she had like
*  teeth missing and it's just sad.
*  It's just really, really sad.
*  And then I'm at the gym working out and I'll see her like down there, you know, with her
*  garbage and everything.
*  And yeah, she doesn't.
*  It's just sad.
*  So when you knew her, she didn't seem like she had any mental health issues?
*  No.
*  Really?
*  No.
*  I mean, she would talk, she would do yoga.
*  I mean, I remember her.
*  Her name was Lotus?
*  Lotus.
*  Well, her name was Lotus Harmony, which I don't know if that's a real name.
*  But at the time, that's how I knew her.
*  And she was always just this sweet lady, you know, just beautiful skin, beautiful smile,
*  always in a good mood.
*  And when you got mad, you were like, oh man, Lotus is pissed, you know, because she was
*  always so friendly.
*  And then now you're just like, damn, and I, you know, I just want, I don't know what to
*  do.
*  I would love to help her because it just breaks my heart.
*  Homeless people break my heart, but female homelessness really, really is sad for me.
*  Yeah, because we're sexist.
*  Well, it's, it's, I feel the same way.
*  You know, it's just like someone's daughter, someone's wife.
*  And it's just out there, you know, vulnerable to the elements and predators.
*  And it's just, it breaks my heart.
*  No, it's awful.
*  But I think most of what you're seeing with homeless people is people that are severely
*  mentally ill.
*  So you got to wonder like what caused, maybe she was on medication and her, you know, her
*  insurance ran out.
*  Yeah.
*  She couldn't.
*  Full on joker.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, that's real.
*  It is real.
*  It's fucking real.
*  There's a lot of people out there with giant mental health issues.
*  I mean, I, I, I know, I know several people who, you know, they would have anxiety.
*  A guy that I used to date is like, you know, we dated for a long ass time, but it's like
*  if he didn't have his, his anti anxiety.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, and he got off that.
*  I mean, he would full on have a panic attack and that would get dirty.
*  And I had to witness that, which was insane.
*  Yeah.
*  People that lose it because of their off their medication.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a sad situation because you're like, you're always going to be tethered to this
*  thing that keeps you sane.
*  Good word by the way.
*  Used it twice today.
*  Did I?
*  Yeah.
*  You said it earlier before we started.
*  I think I probably use it all day.
*  Yeah.
*  I just hope it works.
*  Tethered Tuesday.
*  Hashtag tethered Tuesday.
*  It's, you know, like what happens to them if the fucking coronavirus hits and they get
*  locked in doors for six months.
*  And you just become agoraphobic and lose your shit?
*  Well, we were talking about this the other day that most of what this is all happened
*  from the Reagan administration.
*  During the Reagan administration, they changed the standards of what it means to be mentally
*  ill and they just released people from asylums because they didn't want to pay for it all.
*  And you know, that look, if LA is, LA is a city of 20 plus million people, which is as
*  many people in LA as I think is in all of Australia.
*  So think about that.
*  And that they can't make asylums here.
*  Think about how many abandoned buildings there are.
*  How much money, how much money would it cost?
*  There's currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 70,000 homeless people.
*  Yeah.
*  They said there was some statistic that said there's more empty apartments in this town
*  than homeless people.
*  The thing is, though, that those folks don't just need a place because they'll fuck that
*  place up and punch holes in the wall and shit in there and stuff.
*  Smear it.
*  What they need is help and they need medication and they need counseling and they need, I
*  mean, some people, I don't, I mean, I'm not a mental health expert.
*  Some of them you might not be able to do anything to.
*  Some are so gone, might not.
*  And also they get so filled with despair.
*  I knew a bunch of guys that were homeless back from my pool hall days.
*  There was a bunch of guys that would hang around the pool hall.
*  They would even sleep on the floor.
*  And you know, I knew guys who try to sleep in people's couches.
*  They'd sleep at the bus stops and then they'd come to the pool hall and try to hustle up
*  enough money to get some drugs.
*  It was, they were stuck in this place where they could never get past where they were.
*  They were just in a rut and they could never get out of it.
*  And it was just, it's heartbreaking.
*  Yeah.
*  Despair.
*  So much despair.
*  Because you're just like, what happened?
*  For instance, the other day I'm walking down Santa Monica Boulevard over by Barney's Beannery
*  and I just hear a, and I look over and this kid's like had to be 22, 23 years old.
*  And I was like, what happened?
*  Where are your parents?
*  One too many auditions.
*  Blew a fuse.
*  Yeah.
*  Just snapped.
*  If I hear no one more time, no.
*  CAA dropped him and he's just out there randomly.
*  I'll show you Hollywood Reporter.
*  You motherfuckers.
*  God.
*  I mean, there are people though that you meet in this town where you meet them early in
*  their journey and they still have hope.
*  It's not worked out yet, but it's gonna, I'm gonna make it.
*  And then you run into it in comics.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that's the thing.
*  I think it's so relatable in our field as well, because you know those people.
*  Yeah, we do know those people.
*  I want to say I almost was one of those people.
*  Were you?
*  Oh yeah.
*  When?
*  What time?
*  Give me a time where...
*  2002?
*  And then 2005?
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, there were several...
*  Well, I didn't meet you until when?
*  2007-ish?
*  I want to say, yeah, I think I met you at the Ice House when we were podcasting out
*  there.
*  Yeah.
*  And then when you came back to the store...
*  That was like 14, 2014.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's when I saw you again.
*  And even then it was like, you know, I'm making it work.
*  And I remember you looked at me and you go, you're the weirdest gay guy I've ever met.
*  And I was like, fuck yeah.
*  Why did I say that?
*  I don't know.
*  We were probably all really high.
*  Yeah, probably so.
*  I probably didn't know what I was saying when I was saying it.
*  But I mean, I feel like that's...
*  You get through that struggle and you get through the years of being hungry and the
*  years of like, can I pay my rent this year?
*  And you do whatever you can to just scrounge everything up and do it.
*  So you had those moments where you're like, this might not work out.
*  I might go crazy.
*  Or what's my other option?
*  Or suicide.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, this town's hard.
*  It's very hard.
*  Well, it's also, you see so many people that are doing well, right?
*  Like it seems so far out of reach.
*  Like when you're broke and you see some guy driving by in a Mercedes convertible, you're
*  like, you know, you see these people going into those big high rises off of La Cienega,
*  you know, dormant there and everything.
*  But no one lives there.
*  No one lives there?
*  Oh, no one can afford that shit.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  I mean, there's maybe like, what I've heard is that they build those and then the Saudis
*  want their kids to come to school here and get an American education.
*  So they just buy them for them.
*  But nobody...
*  Have you done any research on this or is this just...
*  I've overheard some things.
*  Well, where the real money is, is that Wilshire stretch.
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That is...
*  And that's always been there.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a... the weekend just bought some fucking redonkulous penthouse up there.
*  That makes sense.
*  Yeah, you get some crazy ass view.
*  But isn't it weird that that one strip is where all the luxury apartments are?
*  Wilshire?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That one... there's this one area.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Like one area around like the Santa Monica area.
*  Where the fire happened, right?
*  Right.
*  That was the Palisades, right?
*  No, that was Wilshire and...
*  Oh, Brentwood?
*  Yeah.
*  They had a fire in the Palisades, too.
*  Westwood.
*  Westwood?
*  There was a fire in the Palisades.
*  There was a fire in...
*  There's fucking...
*  There's fires everywhere.
*  There's a fire any day now.
*  So what turned it around for you?
*  What made it feel like it's gonna be okay?
*  Do you remember?
*  You know what?
*  I'm gonna say something and it's gonna come across really cheesy and... but it's real.
*  I just believed in myself.
*  That's not cheesy.
*  That's...
*  I had to be like, you know what?
*  I know I've been doing this for so long.
*  I know who I am.
*  I know what I've got.
*  Well, ever since I've seen you, you've been a killer.
*  Like, you're really funny.
*  Thank you, man.
*  Like, I've seen some sets from you in the main room.
*  Like, this motherfucker is...
*  You're free.
*  You're up there.
*  You're free.
*  You're loose and unrestrained.
*  You're fucking funny.
*  Thank you.
*  But I didn't see you when you weren't.
*  So when I saw you, you were doing well.
*  From the moment I saw you, when I first met you.
*  And a lot of it, I think, was pressure from Mitzi because I skipped all that.
*  I skipped the open mics.
*  I skipped all of that.
*  I just remember being at my lowest of lows and being like, what do I have to lose?
*  And I remember being a kid and being like, you should do stand-up because I idolized,
*  you know, Joan Rivers and Robin Williams.
*  And I remember being like, fuck it, let's try it out.
*  And I remember getting...
*  How old were you when you got on stage?
*  Doing stand-up?
*  First time.
*  First time.
*  It was 2008.
*  Yeah.
*  That was your first time on stage?
*  That was my first time, yeah.
*  So you thought about it for a long time before you did it.
*  I thought about it for a long time.
*  And then, so from 2008 to 2009, October 2008 to June 2009, that's when I had an open mic
*  at the store.
*  And I just remember Michael Jackson just died and I just remember this energy was crazy
*  that night.
*  And there was an open mic, there was like 16 comics in the main room and I was like
*  14.
*  And I was like, no.
*  And then they were like, Justin's going third.
*  So we didn't start doing the podcast of the Ice House until 2009.
*  Yeah.
*  It was right after I got passed.
*  No, I don't think we started at the Ice House until 2011, now that I'm thinking about it.
*  I think we mostly did it at my house for the first year or two.
*  It was 2011, yeah, 2011.
*  That makes sense.
*  So that's probably when I met you.
*  But you were already rolling by then.
*  Well, no.
*  I had no idea.
*  You were doing well.
*  On stage you were doing well.
*  I was doing well, but I didn't know who I was.
*  I knew how to make people laugh, but I didn't know the process.
*  And so Mitzi was the one who passed me.
*  I'm the last guy she passed at the store.
*  What did she say to you?
*  She didn't say anything.
*  She just pointed.
*  She looked at Tommy and said, make him a regular.
*  And he was like, development spots?
*  And she's like, no, he's ready.
*  And then I remember being taken away and they were like, you've just been passed by Mitzi
*  short.
*  It was like a weird Ren Fair wizard thing.
*  Like, what has happened to you never happens.
*  And then I just remember being like, oh shit.
*  I did my research about the place and I just remember being like, oh damn.
*  And I'm looking at her right now and just that feeling of like, I've got to make this
*  happen.
*  I've got to make sure.
*  Because she had never, I don't even know when the last time she came to the store was,
*  but you know, everyone kind of knew she was ill.
*  And I just wanted to be like, God, I hope this wasn't like just her having dementia
*  and being like, damn.
*  You know, like, oh, she's insane.
*  She picked that guy.
*  Dude, when she passed me, I didn't sleep that night.
*  Really?
*  No.
*  I was lying in bed.
*  I remember thinking I can't believe I got my paid regular at the store.
*  I was already on TV.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh yeah.
*  TV show.
*  Yeah.
*  That didn't mean shit to me.
*  Yeah.
*  What meant something to me was like, I was a, I was a real comic now.
*  It's a stamp of approval.
*  Like I had already been paid.
*  You know, I'm starting to cry.
*  Oh, Joe.
*  Get in touch with the emotions.
*  It's normal.
*  I'd already been doing standup, like for money.
*  You know, I'd done a lot of headlining gigs.
*  You know, I travel, I did some road gigs and I did a lot of stuff around New York before
*  I came to LA, you know, and then I was out here in 94 and she made me first, she made
*  me a non-paid regular and I would go, I'd go on last every night and I was here every
*  night because I didn't have any friends.
*  I was staying at the Oakwood Garden apartments, those pre-furnished apartments and I was on
*  this television show that was terrible.
*  I was just going to the store every night.
*  I would work all day during the thing.
*  I didn't have any friends and then I would go to the comedy store and that's, that's
*  where I like tried to find a home.
*  A family.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So I got these late night sets and it was like, you know, it was always like five people
*  in the audience, six people in the audience and then one night she passed me.
*  She passed me.
*  I've told the story before, but there was a guy named the Todd and the Todd had, he's
*  eventually, he developed like some pretty severe brain issue.
*  Like, and he, he, he went insane and it was really sad because back then I had seen him
*  before I ever came out here on MTV on the half hour comedy hour.
*  Oh, huh.
*  And he sat down next to Mitzi while I was on stage and laughed his ass off.
*  Just, ah, is this the O.R.?
*  The main room?
*  In the O.R.
*  In the O.R. and then I came off stage and she just goes, okay, you're passed.
*  That was it.
*  That was my second audition for the first one.
*  She made me a non-paid regular and I did that for months and then I became a paid regular.
*  But Todd pulled me aside and he said, he goes, ah, I sat there and he goes, you're really
*  funny.
*  He goes, well, I sat there and I laughed really fucking hard and I told Mitzi you're really
*  funny and he goes, and you're going to do that for other people someday.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a cool feeling.
*  It's a cool feeling to, I actually had the moment of seeing her.
*  I think it was at the, it was a reunion.
*  What was it, the 40th reunion something, couple years ago?
*  And they had me on like the class of 2000s.
*  It was like Natasha and some other people were on the lineup, maybe even Duncan, I don't
*  know.
*  And she was sitting in the back.
*  They brought her in in her wheelchair and I was like, I have to say hi to her.
*  You know, I'd never, I didn't get to say hi to her.
*  I didn't get to meet her the last time.
*  She just pointed and took off.
*  And I kind of like, I went up to her and I looked in her eyes and I shook her hand and
*  I said, hi, I'm Justin.
*  It's an honor to meet you.
*  And I just want to say thank you because you changed my life.
*  And she just stared at me and I was like, she doesn't even know.
*  And then all of a sudden she just squeezed my hand and that was it.
*  That's all I needed.
*  So that, that to me was like, oh, she's there.
*  She gets it.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, she'd have those moments where she'd be in and out.
*  But I mean, that's everything that I've done that's led up to where I'm at now has been
*  for her too, because I haven't had other than my, other than my mom and my friends back
*  home, I've never had somebody really believe in me like that.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Right.
*  It's very special.
*  It's very special.
*  And just, yeah, to be a part of a family.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what it was.
*  And that's what helped me getting out of that.
*  Like, I'm not good enough and oh, I'm moving home.
*  It's like, oh, wow, I actually have a home now.
*  And every time I go there now, I just feel so welcome.
*  And you know, it's, it's, it's nice.
*  It's a fraternity.
*  It's a sorority.
*  It's a university.
*  It really is.
*  It's hard to describe for people that don't know, you know, like I was talking to Bill
*  Maher and he was telling me he doesn't go to clubs.
*  He's like, I'm not going to the fucking clubs.
*  I'm like, why wouldn't you go to the club?
*  You don't like going to the clubs?
*  He's like, I graduated from that.
*  I'm a gun with that.
*  I'm like, graduated.
*  I'm like, dude, I'm never leaving.
*  If you graduate, at least you have an alma mater, you know?
*  Well, it's not even that.
*  It's just like, why?
*  That's that's the gym.
*  Yeah, it is the gym.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's totally the you're not done learning.
*  Never done.
*  Stand up is never over.
*  It's an endless journey.
*  And especially if you do new specials, right, because you abandon your
*  material and you're starting from scratch every few years, you're
*  you're never done.
*  Like you have to be around.
*  I don't think there's any other way.
*  I've been I've done it different ways.
*  You know, there was a time where I was gone from the store where it wasn't
*  I wasn't doing my best work and I was doing way more gigs for the UFC.
*  And I wasn't working in the clubs as much.
*  And my stand up just wasn't as sharp.
*  It just wasn't as good.
*  There's no way around it.
*  It's like you have to do the work.
*  There's no other way.
*  And it's also there's something about that environment, that place.
*  It's so nurturing.
*  It is, you know, it's it's crazy because it's like I'm now on the road and
*  it's a.
*  It's my first time actually, like performing in theaters, which is crazy, but.
*  You know, I feel like the main room in the O.R.
*  and all that has been that gym has, like you said, where you're just like, OK,
*  I'm ready to do this.
*  I remember doing the Grand Ole Opry last year in Nashville, like where I grew
*  like in as a kid from the Simon Theater, the Ryman.
*  And like they just were like, all right, get out there.
*  And I went out there. My mom's in the crowd.
*  Like I was just it was so over.
*  I didn't even think about it until afterwards.
*  And I just remember walking out there and just be like, holy shit.
*  I'm at the goddamn Grand Ole Opry.
*  And it was just and I just let's go.
*  Yeah, like this is what you were.
*  This is what you were made for. Let's go.
*  I try to talk to people about what it's like to hang out at the store.
*  Like people that have never been like, why are you there so often?
*  Like, man, just come with me one day.
*  Just come with me one day when I walk through the building.
*  Yeah, it's it's it's pretty.
*  We're so lucky. It's magical is really what it is.
*  And, you know, it's it's a place where, you know, there's egos and there's,
*  you know,
*  rivalries, I guess.
*  And it's it's a few that I've heard of. Yeah, I don't.
*  But I try not to couple of gals that don't like a couple of gals
*  don't like each other. That's all I know about.
*  I know about a couple of gals.
*  Yeah, I don't know about any dudes.
*  You know, I do rivalries.
*  Do you do? I. Yeah.
*  You don't have anybody anybody. Right.
*  Do you? You might have to discuss it.
*  Yeah. Keep positive.
*  I don't have rivalries. I just here's my thing.
*  Couple of people are annoying.
*  Couple of people are annoying.
*  And a couple a couple of people need to check themselves because there's a lot of,
*  like I just said, ego and bullshit.
*  And I just don't have time for that. Right. Yeah. Right.
*  But, you know, for the most part, it's just all hugs.
*  Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I will say that. Like, if you see somebody can just catch up.
*  You haven't seen him in months. You just hug him.
*  Yeah. And you just pick up right where he left off.
*  It's it's like an empowering environment, like it nurtures you.
*  Like you get there, you feel great.
*  You know, that's why people come there, even if they don't have a spot.
*  Like, there's a lot of comics there on the road.
*  They don't even want to do a spot, but they want to come to that back bar
*  and hang out like I was just in town. I wanted to hang out.
*  Ron White does that shit all the time.
*  Oh, yeah. Ron White's always there.
*  Well, he has a house.
*  He has a house in Beverly Hills.
*  So he just gets in his car and says, fuck it all.
*  Come on, hang out. Yeah, that back bar is great.
*  Back bar changed everything.
*  You know, it gave us a place.
*  It gets infiltrated some days by some days.
*  It's all it's now being infiltrated.
*  Normies. We need to stop the infiltration
*  because all of a sudden they'll be there asking questions like, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  This is not what this is for.
*  Yeah. It's not here for you to grill me on how to how to get started
*  and how do you do this and how you do. Hey, hey, hey.
*  I'm here with the comedians.
*  Yeah. Just to hang out with my friends.
*  Oh, I did. I did a spot up in the belly room.
*  Did you really? Did you get out of here?
*  Did you? Where's your name on the wall? Get out of here.
*  Well, that's the thing, right?
*  Anybody who up in the belly room, if it's one of those weirdo shows,
*  those weirdo, we like the weirdo shows.
*  Hey, man, that's how people get started.
*  I started a show there that got picked up.
*  It's coming out next month. What is it? In March.
*  Yeah, it's the show that we got.
*  You're already laughing because we started it two years ago in the belly room.
*  What is it? It's called what was called Stand Up to the Streets.
*  And then you end up to the street. Yeah.
*  It was a dance battle. You know, I had that Roast Battle.
*  Yeah. And so we started it two years ago.
*  My friend, Justine Marino.
*  And the first day we were supposed to do it,
*  you actually bumped us out of the belly room.
*  How did I bump you out? I don't know.
*  You're just like, I'm doing tonight.
*  We're like, ah, damn it, Joe wins again.
*  Nobody told me. No, no, of course not.
*  But then Cominster must have just offered it to me.
*  I think they did. But then we did it like monthly.
*  Every month we went in there and did it, sold out every night.
*  And then this network was like, hey, let's put this on TV.
*  And it's coming out in March. What's it on?
*  It'll be on the E network.
*  I was hoping you didn't say Bravo.
*  Well, same thing.
*  Let's be honest.
*  Isn't that where the Keeping Up with the Kardashians are?
*  Is that your lead in?
*  No, I don't.
*  My wife was in the gym the other day watching that.
*  And I walked in and I go, why? Yeah.
*  You're smart. Yeah.
*  You're interesting. What are you doing?
*  She likes being distracted by nonsense.
*  Well, that's it. That'll do it for you.
*  They fucking know how to do it, too.
*  It's like a hypnosis show. They have these smash cuts.
*  They go quickly from one person to the next.
*  And there's just enough drama.
*  Like, how are they going to resolve this?
*  But it's also like mind hypnosis, because you're just watching.
*  They're like, the other day I had a salad and it was really good.
*  And you're like, why do I care?
*  But tell me more about the salad.
*  I think I'm getting arthritis because my wrist hurts.
*  We want to have a Candyland themed party, but with no candy.
*  Well, I want I want to take them and swap them out on Naked and Afraid.
*  Absolutely.
*  Take them and just drop them off in the jungle.
*  See how they survive. Naked and K-Fraid.
*  That's it. You know, I mean, have them do something really difficult.
*  Like change a tire or just fucking anything hard.
*  Their life is I mean, it's really interesting because I
*  made sort of a.
*  I don't know what you would say.
*  Not an oath, but I decided to stop making fun of Kim Kardashian.
*  She started letting people out of prison.
*  Yes. I'm like, that's powerful.
*  She's real like that.
*  She's really doing something like genuinely good.
*  So I'm going to stop mocking her.
*  I know you have to.
*  But it's and you know, she wants to be a lawyer.
*  Does she go for it? Well, yeah, she's in law school.
*  Is she really? Yeah, she's going to law school.
*  Yes. Does she go there or she do it at home?
*  Does she have her assistant do it and tell her what the answers are?
*  She gets the Cliff Notes. Yeah.
*  I think she's actually doing it.
*  You know, her dad was a.
*  Yeah, Robert Kardashian.
*  He got the OJ off.
*  Yeah. Or helped as part of the dream team.
*  Yeah. But it's apparently the one that he had.
*  OJ handed the bag of blood to a bag of bloody clothes.
*  You heard it first. That's what I heard.
*  Oh, man. I don't know if that's true.
*  But I don't, you know, and you got to.
*  I don't know. I can't knock. I can't.
*  I know she's doing good.
*  I talk shit about him like it sucks because I have like videos up from like
*  years ago.
*  And then I went to the of me just shitting on them.
*  And then I went to the People's Choice Awards and I had my friend
*  Traver Raines like do this.
*  Like he designed this like amazing country western tuxedo.
*  But it was all their faces crying.
*  It was so awesome. Check out my Instagram. It's so good.
*  It was all and I sat and this waiter came over to me and he goes,
*  you know, they're sitting right next to you, right?
*  And I was like, shit.
*  I was freaking out.
*  And so then they all come over and they're sitting right there.
*  And I'm like, oh, like my butthole.
*  What? Oh, look at your jacket.
*  Kim looks up at me and she just goes, oh, my God, that's amazing.
*  And I'm like, oh, oh.
*  And then she's like, Mom, look.
*  And then Chris is trying to turn around and she can't.
*  And then and then Chloe's there and then Courtney Courtney loved it.
*  And then they start taking pictures of me on their Instagram stories.
*  And I'm like, oh, my God.
*  And then I got up to go say hello.
*  Look at that. Isn't that dope?
*  That's when I worked at E.
*  Oh, well, they're not all crying.
*  But they all look at that one.
*  What was a wonky? It's wonky.
*  There's crying. It was awesome.
*  That's a great pic.
*  And then I got up to go say hi to them.
*  And that's when I security guard almost like body slammed me.
*  Really? The one at the bottom.
*  You'll get a full one.
*  Their security guard, they have overzealous security guards.
*  Oh, yeah. But after she got kidnapped in Paris, exactly.
*  And then I'm like and I thought to myself,
*  I'm like, Justin, what the hell are you doing?
*  You can just you're six foot four.
*  You can just walk over and like a normal person sit down.
*  You fucking commoner know your place.
*  Well, not only that, you have pictures of them all over your jacket.
*  I mean, the security guard might think you're fucking insane.
*  And by the way, you look insane. Look at that face.
*  What are you talking about?
*  That's just a strong jawline. Look what's going on here.
*  Look at you. That was. Yeah.
*  You look like a crazy person.
*  You definitely you look good, though. Thank you.
*  It's not bad. Yeah.
*  Represent for a ridiculous jacket and everything.
*  I wanted it. It was it was stupid.
*  I wanted it to be stupid and fun and campy.
*  And so what were you doing there?
*  Were we there for?
*  I was there at the People's Choice Awards
*  because I used to host a show on E called What the Fashion?
*  What the Fashion? Yeah.
*  So it was like that.
*  It was like the millennial version of Fashion Police.
*  What is it like working at E now?
*  Well, I don't work there anymore.
*  Well, what you know, wasn't that long ago was it?
*  It was. Yeah.
*  It seems like an incredibly frivolous pursuit.
*  Well, I didn't really.
*  I didn't really get I worked there for two years,
*  so I built this show up from the ground up called What the Fashion?
*  And then, oh, shit, we're doing an exclusive, aren't we?
*  Are we? Yeah.
*  Yeah. It was for Snapchat, Discover, and it was awesome.
*  And it was a great platform.
*  So it started on Snapchat. Mm hmm.
*  Whoa. Yeah. You're one of those guys.
*  One of those guys. Who knew?
*  And then, you know, I used to write for Joan on Fashion Police a couple of times.
*  Do you have a YouTube channel? No.
*  You should. Do I?
*  Is that still a thing?
*  Dude. I'm starting a podcast.
*  Oh, you are? Yeah.
*  We definitely should have one of those. I'm going to do it. Yeah.
*  But why don't you have a YouTube channel?
*  I don't know.
*  Like, it's a great way to just put up content.
*  Yeah, I'll take the note and do it.
*  Well, I'm going to. But you'd be giant.
*  Well, What the Fashion has a YouTube channel.
*  So it's all up there.
*  I know. But I got out of there in December.
*  But I left just because I didn't get to really do all the fun stuff.
*  They just kind of. What's the fun stuff?
*  Well, you know, like red carpet and like go to the events and stuff.
*  And I was just locked in. Dude, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can do that.
*  And bonus, no boss.
*  Yeah, no boss. That's what I had to learn.
*  I had to learn to be my own boss at the end of the year.
*  That's this. That's right here.
*  You're on a show with no boss.
*  Wait, you don't have a boss? No boss.
*  Wow. Yeah. You're a boss ass bitch, aren't you?
*  Boss ass bitch. Yeah.
*  I know. So that's what I'm learning this year is to be my own boss.
*  Yes, you can do it. 100 percent.
*  I just try to encourage as many comedians as possible to do it.
*  It's like you can put up content of your own.
*  You can do anything on your own.
*  I mean, so many people like Tim Dillon.
*  Perfect example. Oh, by the way, have you seen these?
*  I just got this.
*  Exclusively, I love daddy.
*  Tim Dillon, sure. Oh, is that him in drag?
*  It's him as Megan McKean.
*  Oh, I got blocked by her. You did, too?
*  On Twitter. Yeah. Tim Dillon. Of course he did.
*  Why did you get blocked by her?
*  I just said something on Twitter.
*  It was just kind of like, what do you say?
*  I don't remember, but I told her to fucking calm down.
*  And now she's like, she's my father, my father, my father, my father.
*  And now she's like, I love gay people.
*  And I'm like, OK, bitch.
*  But yeah, she she.
*  That's a good stamp of approval, too.
*  Getting past my midst and getting blocked by Megan McCain.
*  Well, she blocked Tim Dillon and he was he was very excited about it.
*  It's kind of an epic thing.
*  I got blocked by a Chloe Grace Moretz. And who's that?
*  She's an actress. Why did she block you?
*  Because I yelled at her in a movie theater. Whoa.
*  She was on her phone. Really? Yeah.
*  And I was watching The Purge.
*  So I was like in the moment she was talking on the phone in a fucking movie.
*  No, she was on it.
*  She was like checking Instagram full brightness. Just no.
*  Yeah. And she was sitting in the front.
*  And I oh, I was livid.
*  I've talked about this several times and I'm still fucking.
*  How did she know that it was you?
*  She didn't know it was me because it was dark.
*  And I went over and screamed at her and told her to get off her fucking phone.
*  Then I turned around.
*  The audience started clapping because everyone was pissed off.
*  So I was a movie hero.
*  And then as I went out, someone was like, that's the girl you were yelling at.
*  And paparazzi were all around her.
*  And I was like, oh, I'm taking this to Twitter.
*  I'm going to tweet. And I started tweeting at her saying, hey, bitch,
*  get off your phone in the movie theater, especially if you're an actress
*  and we're paying money to see you doing movies, you know?
*  And then she blocked me.
*  So then I wasn't done yet.
*  I tweeted her boyfriend at the time's mom, who happens to be Victoria Beckham,
*  Posh Spice, and was like, hey, your son's dating an asshole.
*  You know who didn't block me? Victoria Beckham.
*  She probably didn't like her either.
*  Yeah, I bet she did.
*  And fucking her son, she's probably angry.
*  That dirty bitch.
*  Get her bad breath over my son's dick. God.
*  Jesus.
*  Wait, I just got a notification.
*  She just blocked you on Twitter. You made it.
*  Good. I don't check.
*  Oh, my God. You could block me all day on Twitter.
*  I will never notice.
*  Who's the most famous person who's ever blocked you?
*  I don't have no idea. You don't know?
*  You don't care. I stopped reading Twitter mentions and all that stuff a long time ago.
*  I need to get better at that. I don't read shit.
*  I'm going to do it, though.
*  I'm going to read these comments. Why?
*  Because it kind of gets me hard.
*  I just like I just think I think the whole premise of comments
*  is fascinating to me how someone takes time out of their day
*  to just this motherfucker like, you know, it just it just blows my mind, you know.
*  And it's funny because sometimes they're very supportive.
*  Like, once I left the show, you know, people are coming and tagging me and stuff
*  and being like, we want Justin back. Where's Justin?
*  The show's not the same. And I'm just kind of like, well, it ran its course.
*  You know, I did my thing and I'm moving on. Right.
*  But it just it's just so funny how some people are just like, you know, I did.
*  What's it called? Lights Out with David Spade the other day.
*  And it was like, get this faggot off the show.
*  And I'm like, shit, how rude. I know.
*  It's just but it makes me laugh because I'm like, well, who's on the show?
*  Me, not you. So who's the faggot now?
*  I don't think that changes.
*  I don't think that change.
*  People say things all day long. Doesn't change who you are.
*  I don't think it changes.
*  I think what the real problem is that people have access to your emotions.
*  If it doesn't fuck with you, right.
*  Then I don't know if you're one of those people.
*  But for most people, it fucks with them. Like, Bert Kreischer said it best.
*  He goes, I was looking at Twitter the other day and he goes, and then I was thinking,
*  why am I risking the fact that something might fuck with my head
*  or hurt my feelings? Right.
*  Then I get off of it. That's what he said.
*  I was like, that's a good point.
*  Because that's kind of what it is.
*  Well, we live in toxic times, you know.
*  It's not a good way to talk.
*  Because if someone's in front of you, you would rarely be that mean.
*  It would it would take a lot for someone to be that mean in front of you.
*  But on Twitter, there's no real connection.
*  Plus, they don't like the fact that you are the guy who's on TV and they're not.
*  That's a big thing. Fuck him.
*  Why would you? Why are you on there? Not me.
*  And people have this weird idea about people who are doing well,
*  that if they're doing well, you're allowed to shit on them.
*  You know, like I fucking saw something where someone was talking about
*  Kobe Bryant's wife and they said, with all her money, she'll be fine.
*  Oh, my God. Imagine thinking like that.
*  Like your emotions are attached to the fact that you have money.
*  So now you're fine. You're fine. You have money.
*  You fucking daughter and your husband died in a fiery helicopter crash.
*  And these people, this one person was like, with all her money, she's fine.
*  Just some shallow broke. She doesn't have emotions.
*  She'll move on. Amazing. She's got three other daughters.
*  It's also this thing where they feel like they're allowed to do that
*  because you are really successful. Right.
*  You know, because and then with you, it's like you're on TV. They're not.
*  They're allowed to just shit all over you. Yeah.
*  And there's a way that they can do it through Instagram comments or Twitter
*  comments. Hiding. Yeah.
*  Or an anonymous.
*  What's it called? The little the direct message.
*  No, when they when when there's not a picture, when it's just the eggshell
*  or whatever, they can.
*  And you can create fake accounts and you can create multiple accounts.
*  Oh, yeah. It's just some people just have too much time on their damn hands.
*  Yeah. And it's just it's it's sad.
*  And that's just that. Yeah, that's fucked up when people just think.
*  Well, there's so many voices. They're not people to. Yeah.
*  Well, they just feel like it's a free shot. Mm hmm.
*  Look, I would have felt the same way if I was 15.
*  If you gave me a fucking Twitter account when I was 15
*  and I was frustrated at the world, I would have said the meanest shit
*  to everyone and anyone I could have gotten a hold of. Yeah.
*  100 percent. I would have said the meanest shit.
*  You know, I feel terrible for kids today.
*  I do, too. That their growth and their development is going to,
*  you know, it's going to be permanent record.
*  Yeah, there's a there was a really good ad for God.
*  What was it for? It was a cell phone ad and it talks to a mother.
*  It talks to three generations of people and they talk, you know, the grandpa.
*  What was it like when you were a kid?
*  He's like, oh, I went outside. We caught fish.
*  I remember getting chased by a bear and throwing a fish down just so, you know.
*  And then I ran out of fish because the bear kept eating them.
*  But I got away. And then he talked to the daughter and she was like, oh,
*  we built forts when we were kids. And then it talks to the kids.
*  It's like, what's your best thing about being a kid?
*  It's like I play video games and I talk I check emails.
*  And it's like, oh, and they show the videos to the grandparents and the parents.
*  And they're just like, oh, this sucks.
*  Well, a friend of mine works at Disneyland.
*  And he said they're having a really hard time recruiting young people
*  that know how to communicate. What does that mean?
*  Like they don't know how to communicate with people.
*  They're stunted because they spend so much time tweeting to each other
*  and text messaging each other that talking to strangers, they've they haven't
*  developed these common courtesy skills and just the ability to talk to people
*  and actually be curious.
*  And they have to tell them, put your fucking phone down.
*  Oh, yeah. They're on their phone.
*  They check their phone like every five, 10 minutes.
*  They're just addicted to checking their phone.
*  And they're addicted to this weird little dopamine rush that you get
*  from looking at your mentions. What is it?
*  Did someone talk about it?
*  Like, what's going on? You know, it's really fucking weird is that there's a new
*  there's a new way that that younger people are getting in touch
*  with each other is that they will take a picture of themselves.
*  And then they'll put a text like, what's up?
*  And then someone will text back with the picture.
*  Not much you.
*  What? So, yeah, does that make sense?
*  So they'll actually just so it's like, say if you and I were talking on the phone,
*  it's like I'll take I'll take a selfie.
*  I'll be like, hey, what's up? And send it to you.
*  So it's not just the text is a text with a photo.
*  Yes. It's a new face photo with a message like a Snapchat or an Instagram.
*  Like, what's going on?
*  Do you have friends that they they send you
*  or they rather call you FaceTime just out of the blue?
*  Yes. And I don't answer them.
*  I hate that. That's a new thing.
*  It's so weird. A lot of people are doing that.
*  You know, it's even weirder is looking at somebody
*  crossing the street or something.
*  And they're just like, yeah, so I don't know.
*  My favorite is I have a friend of mine who's my neighbor as well.
*  And he was he was he was FaceTiming.
*  He was FaceTiming on Instagram, promoting his brother's.
*  His brother has a not a club, but it's like a social experience.
*  He's trying to promote it or whatever.
*  And he was like, yeah, go check this out.
*  And this guy on a skateboard goes right by him.
*  He's like, yeah.
*  He was like, OK, that happened.
*  And that that's not all heroes wear capes, you know.
*  I hate people face and I hate people who FaceTime on planes and in airports.
*  Yeah, that's weird. Right.
*  It's loud. And you're talking to the other person loudly.
*  Mm hmm. Put your headphones on, you savage.
*  You fucking animal. Oh, what's wrong with you?
*  Yeah, it blows my mind.
*  But the FaceTime thing is seems like it's within the last year or two.
*  Guys started just FaceTime in me out of nowhere.
*  FaceTiming you. Yes, my friends.
*  No. And you answer it sometimes.
*  I like them. How do you feel?
*  A lot of rappers, rappers, the FaceTime.
*  That makes sense. Yeah, they love it.
*  They like FaceTime. Just want to see where you're at.
*  I just think it's just a more fun way of doing it or something.
*  Have you done a group FaceTime? What?
*  Stop it. It's happened on accident.
*  In a group text, you can accidentally hit
*  make this a FaceTime call and it will call everyone in the group text.
*  I would walk into the ocean.
*  When everyone answers, it's kind of interesting
*  because everyone's like, well, what the fuck?
*  You see what seven people are all doing at once.
*  It must be an emergency.
*  Well, you would have to have an iPhone Max for that.
*  Yeah, the newer ones. The big ones.
*  You want the big one. You want the small phone for that.
*  I switched over to the small phone so I look at it less.
*  That's how stupid I am. Oh, yeah.
*  Like, if I have a small phone, I'll look at it less.
*  The new Samsung. The little flip.
*  No, no, no. Well, they announced that in the Super Bowl.
*  They announced a new one today. It's got a seven inch screen.
*  What? By default.
*  God damn. It's like seven point one inches.
*  I think they said what is the note 100 megapixel camera.
*  Oh, God. And a hundred times 108 megapixel.
*  Maybe we're going to see each other's pores now.
*  Is that what I'm zoom on it?
*  Nostril hairs. I want to see the eyelash lice that you're carrying.
*  Oh, yeah. Crazy phone.
*  Samsung is always raising the I mean, they have to keep up.
*  Like in order to jump people off of the apple tit,
*  they have to make sure that they really provide something exceptional.
*  I know. You know, I'm so glad that guy was barking about the Apple
*  keyboards the other day.
*  I was typing last night on my Lenovo ThinkPad, which is my
*  preferred method of writing.
*  It's so much better because I have a MacBook, the new one, too.
*  They like, oh, we fixed the keyboard.
*  And no, you didn't.
*  They didn't really fix it. You didn't fix it for a writer.
*  It's I can write on and I have written.
*  What do you have a pen? And it just kind of.
*  No, you're right.
*  With the keyboard, the keyboard blows. It just sucks.
*  It's not good.
*  The keyboard and Lenovo is like effortless.
*  It's so much better. There's a little push to it.
*  The little keys have like a little C shape to them.
*  So it's a little dimple. Your fit fits.
*  Your finger fits in perfectly.
*  Finger dimples. Yes.
*  And you just you just gently crest the keys and they touch.
*  How's name Taiki Wakiti? Taika Watiti.
*  Watiti. Yeah.
*  Savage. I love him.
*  What does he do?
*  He just he was the director of Jojo Rabbit.
*  He just won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.
*  I heard Jojo Rabbit's hilarious. It's fun.
*  It's really good. He's just a cool guy.
*  He's the first indigenous person to win an Oscar.
*  Where's he from? I think Australia.
*  Oh, good for him. Yeah.
*  He's right, though, about those shitty fucking keyboards.
*  Yeah. Jamie sent it to me immediately.
*  And I was like, yes, yes.
*  Did you say yes? Yes.
*  What's the writer's guild to take it up with like fucking Apple
*  because it's causing people pain?
*  How much he hates the Apple keyboard.
*  I don't think it's really causing people pain.
*  He's joking a little bit. He's joking a little bit, but.
*  It's not good.
*  The fucking Lenovo's are so much better.
*  Lenovo ThinkPads. If you.
*  I want a Lenovo ThinkPad. What does it look like?
*  I'll show you.
*  ThinkPad get to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon.
*  That's what I have. It is the shit.
*  It weighs nothing.
*  It weighs nothing. It's beautiful.
*  It folds completely flat. It's so superior.
*  The thing is that it's just like if you're caught in the Apple ecosystem.
*  Right. Which I am.
*  By the way, Windows 10 is not bad.
*  It's excellent. It doesn't.
*  It's never crashed on me.
*  I've had Lenovo keep.
*  I've had three different ThinkPads now for the last three years.
*  And they haven't crashed on me once.
*  That looks sharp.
*  It's fucking so those keys are magical, man.
*  Your fingers just glide over those keys.
*  You make so many less mistakes.
*  So many less. So many less.
*  So many so much fewer mistakes, much fewer mistake.
*  Look at all the stars it has.
*  Four point six stars.
*  You fucking twats.
*  Get your shit together, Apple.
*  It's just a it is.
*  And by the way, you can also get it in a touch screen.
*  What? Yeah.
*  It's a superior laptop.
*  If you write, if you like, like for me, I like to come home from the store.
*  I spark a join up.
*  And when I'm, you know, everyone in my house is asleep.
*  All my kids are asleep. My wife's asleep.
*  That's when I get my writing done.
*  Yeah. And that thing is a breeze, man.
*  I just my fingers just glide over those keys.
*  And I like I brought my my MacBook on the road and I was writing on that.
*  I'm not the same dog shit. That's so interesting.
*  I can't write on my MacBook because it's just too hard.
*  And then I find myself writing on my phone, but I want something
*  like you said, sleeker, softer.
*  It's a spark a joint.
*  Not some shoddy. Yeah.
*  Smooth operator.
*  Oh, anytime. What happened to her?
*  She's around.
*  She's like the McRib.
*  Every now and then she'll come back.
*  I think sometimes people just get tired of all the fucking lights, like the
*  all the attention, the bullshit, you know.
*  I do that, man. I love to just chill out.
*  Everyone thinks I'm always just like party animal, like all that.
*  I'm like, no, I'll wake up and be like, Alexa, put on some 1930s jazz.
*  Ooh. And I'll just.
*  Alexa will do that. Oh, yeah.
*  Like 1930s jazz. Very specific.
*  Yeah. What is will Siri do that?
*  Huh? Will Siri do that? Yeah.
*  1930s jazz. Oh, yeah.
*  It's just like a play.
*  Yeah. Hey, Siri, play some 1930s jazz.
*  Here we go.
*  Here's some 1930s jazz.
*  Worship the devil. Oh, my God, Siri.
*  That's not that's not.
*  No, that's what Tom Hanks' son listens to.
*  Is that is that?
*  No, no, that's definitely some steel.
*  Sorry, you don't know what the fuck 1930s jazz is, do you?
*  Oh, she's fucking with me.
*  But it does work.
*  Hey, Siri, play some John Coltrane.
*  Here we go. If it's the same song.
*  Yeah.
*  Hmm. That's 1930s.
*  That's legit. That's legit.
*  Put my dimmer down, light an incense.
*  Oh, it's the best. Light that lighter.
*  Get that spoon out.
*  Prepare the heroin.
*  Black tar. Only the best.
*  Is that the best? Allegedly.
*  Have you ever tried heroin? No.
*  Oh, I don't know why. Guilty.
*  God. No, I have not tried heroin.
*  Have you tried cocaine? Yes.
*  How dare you? I have.
*  Getting coked up in the streets.
*  Coked up right around. I can't do it anymore.
*  OK, what happened?
*  Because you don't know what that shit's cut with anymore.
*  That's true.
*  And I saw some video and they're like, do it one more time and it'll kill you.
*  I'm like, nope. Fentanyl.
*  Yeah. Well, I had a guy in here.
*  What was the guy's name?
*  Ben Westhoff, the writer who wrote that book on Fentanyl.
*  He used to be a journalist.
*  He used to write for LA Weekly.
*  Ben Westhoff. Fentanyl Inc.
*  Yes, Fentanyl Inc.
*  And he said they were reviewing all these raves where people were dying.
*  And they're dying from MDMA.
*  And it didn't make any sense.
*  So they did some tests and they found it's not really Fentanyl
*  or it's not really MDMA they're dying from.
*  It's MDMA cut with Fentanyl.
*  Yeah. And plus they're not hydrating themselves because you sweat.
*  Because those people will just they'll just rave until their heart explodes.
*  It's probably some of that, too.
*  It's probably a few of those.
*  But a lot of it is just overdoses of Fentanyl because they're cutting it.
*  You know, it's like trust drugs anymore.
*  That's why drugs should be legal.
*  You know, that's one of the Mayor Pete things.
*  He had this weird conversation with one of the journalists where he was
*  talking about decriminalizing drugs.
*  And the guy was like, would you so you would say heroin would be legal?
*  And he goes, no, it wouldn't be legal.
*  He goes, well, that's what decriminalizing is.
*  Like, this is a weird conversation where they're trying to work out
*  the legal logistics of what's decriminalized and what's not.
*  But it sounds totally counterproductive that if you wanted to have a healthy,
*  happy society, you'd make cocaine and heroin legal.
*  Right. But the problem is, if it's not legal,
*  then people are going to get it anyway and they're going to get it
*  from the fucking cartels and you're going to get it.
*  And it's going to be spiked.
*  I don't want anybody to do heroin.
*  I don't want anybody to do coke.
*  I don't want anybody to do any of those drugs.
*  But the only way you're going to give them pure versions of that drug
*  is to make sure that it's actually from a reputable source.
*  Reputable. Yeah, I say reputable.
*  It's a weird way of saying it. Tomato, tomato.
*  No, I've done beautiful. I've done.
*  Who says reputable? It's like weird people that say nuclear.
*  Nuclear. Nuclear.
*  So nuclear. Nuclear.
*  The I've done ice. That was one thing.
*  What is ice? So I think it's meth.
*  Yeah. How was that? Good times? Awful.
*  How long you stay awake? Oh, all night.
*  Shit. I was like, I think I was 22.
*  And like a friend of mine at the time, I guess, was like, hey,
*  we're going to smoke this out of a light bulb.
*  I'm like, fuck. Yeah. I don't know why.
*  How do you smoke it out of a light bulb?
*  It's like it's like the end of it was cut off and you just lighted underneath.
*  It's like a. How would one cut a light bulb?
*  I don't fucking know. I like I.
*  Oh, man, I did that.
*  And I just remember going to a bar and just talking the fucking bartender's ear off.
*  Just. Just nonstop.
*  I remember going home and then I remember it being like three o'clock in the morning.
*  I'm like, you know, it sounds good.
*  I'm going to move all my furniture around. I was just.
*  Like my neighbors were probably like, you fucking asshole.
*  And then I remember going to bed finally at like six o'clock in the morning.
*  And it was the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my life.
*  Like my body just felt broken, rotted,
*  rotted. Yeah. Just just corroded.
*  Well, that energy is coming out of somewhere.
*  Well, because once you do it, you're addicted.
*  So it was like really I was.
*  Yeah. It was like right when it ended is when my body was like, you need more.
*  You're going through withdrawals.
*  So I would I would one time one time.
*  It's all it takes. Really? Mm hmm.
*  And then I literally sat in my room and just shook it all out and sweated.
*  And I remember making a vow to myself.
*  I was like, I am never doing this again.
*  And then finally, it was like someone asked me, they're like, have you ever?
*  I was like, yeah, I've never done math.
*  I mean, I've done ice and they're like, that's what that is.
*  You dumb fuck.
*  And I was like, oh, man.
*  I mean, it was not not pleasant.
*  And you see how quickly people can become addicted to that one time.
*  One time you're addicted. All it takes. Wow.
*  So at the end of it, you're like, oh, my God, I'm so wrecked.
*  I just need a little to get me over.
*  And then next, you know, you're doing a little all the time.
*  That's the same shit with Adderall, by the way. Yeah.
*  That's what Adderall is.
*  It's just a very slow release.
*  I think that's what Xanax is.
*  I think that's what it is.
*  You don't think so? Different different kinds of drugs.
*  They're not amphetamines. Well, right.
*  The amphetamines are a real issue for people that seek productivity.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  That's why you're trying to clean your house and organize and stuff.
*  It's just like, oh, man, that was brutal.
*  That's what happens with housewives.
*  They want to the real housewives of no real ones.
*  Real actual housewives.
*  They want to organize L.A.
*  housewives that take it.
*  Take a fucking Adderall.
*  Just start put it in a smoothie, putting all their books on the shelves
*  in alphabetical order and that kind of shit.
*  Just listen to a podcast. Calm down.
*  No. Just put your podcast on.
*  Do both. Both at the same time with a butt plug in.
*  They just they want to multitask.
*  So specific. Yeah, they want to multitask.
*  Get the old butt wrecker.
*  That's a good brand.
*  A buddy of mine who used to date a girl that liked to do speed.
*  He said they're the best girls to have anal sex with
*  because they never eat.
*  So they never shit.
*  And I was like, I didn't need to know that.
*  And that is honesty.
*  He's like, she never eats.
*  There's nothing going on down there because there's nothing worse
*  than getting a get an oil slick.
*  Whoo. That's not fun.
*  Yeah, that's I mean, that's what it's over.
*  There's no coming back from that.
*  Some people can come back.
*  Some people on ice. Yeah.
*  They're OK. I like that smell.
*  Oh, you son of a bitch.
*  Yeah. Who is my dipstick?
*  Yeah. Whoo. Yeah.
*  And you have to plan that, right? You do.
*  You have to do it correctly.
*  You have to time your food intake and make sure you don't drink too much coffee.
*  It's a lot going on there.
*  It's a lot going on.
*  But if you find the one, you can do it right.
*  The one. That's the one area
*  where the the good Lord has done a disservice to gay folks.
*  They haven't given them a lot of options.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't.
*  It's good not to. I can't.
*  I don't trust my butt.
*  Honestly, I don't.
*  It's like you shouldn't.
*  It's like I don't trust my butt.
*  I do not trust.
*  I don't want anything in there. Good move.
*  I don't want I feel like it's like I feel like there's an octopus beak
*  that comes out and I'll just snap.
*  I feel like it's the sarlacc pit that Boba Fett fell into in Star Wars.
*  I don't trust my butt.
*  I don't. If you try to put anything in there, I'm just like, yeah.
*  Just clamp. Nope.
*  Just do a lot of squats that way. Nobody would want to.
*  Just too tight. Just just.
*  Deadlifts. But those that's kind of hot, though.
*  Big legs are hot.
*  Yeah, but not too big.
*  Like if your butt is so tight, they're like literally it clamps down.
*  You know, like people get sleep apnea like football players do
*  because their neck is so big.
*  You're like, they can't.
*  That's awful. Airpipe. That's real.
*  Yeah. There's so much muscle in their neck that when they lay back,
*  like they they they choke to death like football players would choke to death.
*  Falling asleep.
*  Sleep apnea just from giant necks.
*  You do that with your butthole.
*  Makes sense.
*  But then dudes with little dicks would seek you out like, aha.
*  Behold, I found a place where it can be done.
*  Oh, God.
*  It's nothing worse than a small dick.
*  Nothing worse.
*  Well, yeah. But but is that that's a weird thing if you.
*  OK. So like gay guys, even though here we go.
*  You don't want it in your butt.
*  You still want a big one.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  I mean, I get it, but I don't get it.
*  I do get it. It's like.
*  Genetics. Do you want small tits?
*  I don't mind. See, I don't mind either.
*  But I think a lot of people in the in the I mean, wait, wait.
*  The straight community and the straight.
*  A lot of people in the straight community.
*  They'll take whatever they can.
*  Let me speak for my people.
*  Uh huh. Go for it. What they like is butts.
*  Girls are big butts.
*  Yes. Why is that?
*  Because it's genes.
*  It's like the genes are signaling that this is a healthy woman
*  who will give birth easily.
*  Oh, it's the old medieval hip trick.
*  It's all she can. It is all true.
*  Labor many moon children like shit.
*  Why does someone want someone with perfect features?
*  Was it because you want someone with great genetics?
*  Like there's there's a bunch of things that are favored.
*  Right. Like height.
*  Tall men are favored.
*  Strong men are favored.
*  Genetics, big dicks.
*  Mating. Yeah, that's all it is.
*  It's all like genes.
*  But like if you see animal genes, if you see like a Kendall Jenner who
*  writes, who's not like her sisters, she is not what happened
*  because she wants to model.
*  So she can't do she can't have.
*  Yeah, she can't fill her ass up with like silicone and show.
*  I thought you were talking about like facial surgery.
*  Is that Kylie or Kendall? Which one?
*  Oh, my God, let's play a game called Name the Kardashian with Joe Rogan.
*  I don't know which one is the model.
*  Kendall's the youngest.
*  Well, like there's Kylie and Kendall. Those are.
*  Which one had her face changed? Kylie.
*  OK, so this is the I mean, which one?
*  But they all did. Kylie.
*  Kylie did. But Kendall's the one who kind of kept herself normal.
*  Not normal. I don't want to say that.
*  She didn't fill her butt up with she didn't fill her butt up.
*  She's a model. She's doing Fashion Week.
*  She's yeah, that's OK.
*  So the one oh, my God, I can't which one's which Kendall's on the left.
*  Kylie's on the right. OK.
*  So see how the one on the left is natural and the one on the right
*  is the one she had her face fixed.
*  Yeah. So Kylie's like the billionaire who's, you know,
*  selling makeup and tits and ass and look at those fake boobs.
*  Yeah. Good Lord. But Kendall, I mean.
*  So Kendall has real ones. Kendall has.
*  I mean, those are normal. Those are normal.
*  The ones next to those are balloons.
*  So which which one's more attractive to you?
*  Depends on how horny you are and how drunk you are. Interesting.
*  And who's interested?
*  That is a good factor. Whoever's who's interested.
*  Yeah. Who's going to be in the past? I've been drunk.
*  I bet you have. Yeah.
*  I bet both at the same time, huh?
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, the store, too. I've done it.
*  I've tried it. I've tried it.
*  I've tried it.
*  Jeans. Pick them out of the pick them out of the audience.
*  Just I like you.
*  Jeans are strange, man. They are weird.
*  What attracts people to others?
*  I mean, there's a lot of factors, right?
*  Like mean people are very unattractive. Right.
*  Boring people are very unattractive.
*  Stupid people are very unattractive.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  But then then it gets down to like animal stuff, like shapes, shapes of bodies,
*  size of hogs, right?
*  Right. Size of hogs.
*  The size of the hog.
*  I think they're at Coachella this year.
*  Oh, it's the name of the band.
*  I get it. I thought it was like a.
*  Well, I think, yeah, I think I think everybody.
*  And that's always been fascinating to me is when you see like the study of
*  of the law of attraction, where it's like you see something you like,
*  how your pupils dilate and how you how you kind of like pheromones and weird shit.
*  I got a cologne. God, I can't remember what the oh, it was called.
*  So that's who buys cologne. Huh?
*  Gay guys. What about wondering who the fuck's buying cologne?
*  Me. I love cologne.
*  How many different colognes you have in your house?
*  I probably have about like 10.
*  Whoa. You're a connoisseur.
*  Yeah. Do you have like different like tonight is the night. Yeah.
*  I pull it out of the vault.
*  No, not this one.
*  No, I sign up for Scentbird, which Scentbird is the cologne.
*  They send you a different cologne every month.
*  It's a cologne club.
*  It's like Dollar Shave Club.
*  It's like, yeah, it's like 14.95.
*  You get a little violet cologne. Christ.
*  Hey, I've been with them for two, three years.
*  Scentbird. Oh, my God.
*  But I do it every every year.
*  I'll go. I'll have my January through my December smells.
*  You have different different times.
*  Get the fuck out. OK, well, that's a wrap.
*  You have different smells for different times of the year.
*  Yeah, I got my spring. I got my summer.
*  I got my fall and I got I got a little spicy at the end of the year.
*  Oh, so you get spicy towards the fall in the winter.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a pumpkin sort of a cinnamon.
*  No, just like a nice Dolce and Gabbana, a little rag and bone.
*  A little bit. Yeah.
*  And they have them all on there and they're nice.
*  Have you I've always smelled good.
*  OK, I like people are like, damn, you smell good.
*  I'm like, fuck yeah, you're right.
*  Do you put like a tiny bit tiny bit just a touch?
*  Just that's it. But you have 10.
*  Yeah. So and they keep sending you more.
*  Are you worried you're going to run out of space?
*  People going to come over your house like, oh, my God, Justin's insane.
*  Oh, God. Fucking house is filled with his.
*  He's wallowing in his own filth.
*  No, I have I have usually I'll use for the month.
*  I'll use that as my month.
*  And then, you know, if I don't use them, I'll save them.
*  But there is there is a cologne that I had.
*  It was called sexual.
*  Sexual. Is that even a word or is that just some asshole?
*  It's some asshole.
*  So let's just go with it.
*  This is how you say it.
*  Like when people would say in Spanish, can you tell me where is the restaurante?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You are sexual.
*  But it had pheromones in it.
*  Sure it did. So it had pheromones in it.
*  And every time I would wear it, women would be like, hmm.
*  Hey, yeah, good.
*  Because they probably took some fat guy and made him run a treadmill.
*  And then they dripped his fucking underwear into each bottle.
*  Oh, did Bert Kreischer?
*  Yeah, there he is.
*  I didn't call you fat Bert.
*  Justin Martindale does it all the time.
*  I don't think he's fat.
*  No, he's he's definitely fat.
*  He's thick with two C's.
*  No, he just Google Bert is fat.
*  You'll find I know.
*  But that's mean.
*  He's thick.
*  Tom and Bert call each other fat.
*  The bear fared.
*  Chamed each other. What is it?
*  The two bears, one cave.
*  Yeah, that's a gay term.
*  Tell them, you should tell them that.
*  They should know.
*  They probably don't know.
*  They'd probably be stunned and have to change their broadcast.
*  Two bears, one cave.
*  They're both bears in the gay community.
*  Those are bears.
*  So they didn't get the joke.
*  They didn't get the reference.
*  I think they know.
*  They should know.
*  Are they technically bears?
*  Yeah.
*  Don't you have to be kind of a little buff to be a bear?
*  No.
*  No. No.
*  Just hairy.
*  Yeah. And fat.
*  I don't know what you are.
*  What am I?
*  You're not a bear.
*  A chimp.
*  Huh? A chimp.
*  No.
*  Yeah. What is Joe Rogan in the gay community?
*  That's I think that's why we I don't have a thing either.
*  Good. Congratulations.
*  I used to be a twink and now I'm not.
*  And now I'm not hairy.
*  What changed?
*  I grew up, Joe.
*  Yeah. I grew up.
*  I became mature.
*  I fell down.
*  That's an issue with gay folks, right?
*  As you get older.
*  See, older guys that are straight can get hoes.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  Gold diggers.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I love a good old hoe.
*  I know some dudes who are just really old and they have young,
*  hot girlfriends or wives.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And it's hilarious because they got that.
*  Chetta.
*  Yeah.
*  They got that Chetta.
*  But then.
*  That doesn't work with guys.
*  Does it?
*  Yeah.
*  It does for twinks, right?
*  It does for young gays.
*  The young gays.
*  There's definitely some where I've been like,
*  this guy's like 85 years old.
*  And it's like.
*  I said 19 year old.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Like, yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  But that's OK in the gay community,
*  whereas that's disgusting in the straight community.
*  If you see an 80 year old guy with an 18 year old girl,
*  you want to beat him to death.
*  You piece of shit.
*  But if you see an 80 year old gay guy with an 18 year old boy,
*  like, oh, I found himself a fella.
*  Yeah.
*  But you also can look and be like, that'll do, pig.
*  But you know, also, the other way,
*  if you find an 80 year old lady and she's
*  got a 24 year old boyfriend, you go, girl.
*  Go, bitch.
*  You go.
*  Good for her.
*  Good for her.
*  Nobody's mad at her.
*  Yeah.
*  If anything, you're mad at the guy
*  for like playing that old lady and getting
*  her to buy you a Corvette.
*  See, that's how I feel about Britney Spears right now.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What's going on with her?
*  She's kind of going through a thing.
*  What is her thing?
*  She's just, you know, she's in a concert.
*  What's it called?
*  A conservatorship?
*  Conservatorship?
*  I don't know.
*  Conservatorship.
*  Conservatorship.
*  Like, her dad's in charge of her and she's like almost 40.
*  Right.
*  Is that an issue?
*  Yeah, she's got like mental shit going on.
*  If you look at her Instagram, she's just walking down,
*  just flipping her hair.
*  Let's go to her Instagram.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Here we go.
*  Britney, I love you.
*  Came up a week ago.
*  I thought you were getting to this, but.
*  Oh, wait, what?
*  I've heard, like, we didn't get there, but I knew this was a.
*  When I was having a conversation with Bill Maher, because.
*  He talked about this?
*  Well, I said, she's hot.
*  And Bill Maher said, what?
*  What are you talking about?
*  And then my wife gave me a ton of shit
*  for saying that Britney Spears is hot.
*  She's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
*  She's not hot?
*  She's, you know, there's a whole thing saying, you know,
*  hashtag save Britney, because they just
*  feel like she's not in control of anything in her life anymore.
*  Like, her dad owns everything.
*  She can't drive.
*  She can't do.
*  Right, but don't you think there's a reason for that?
*  If she was in control, she.
*  Whoa.
*  She doesn't.
*  Cracked out.
*  Yeah.
*  But she has, like, this hot 24-year-old.
*  Who put that photo up?
*  She did.
*  Let me see that photo.
*  Well, somebody did.
*  Oh my god.
*  Go large with that picture.
*  Bro, look at those.
*  She looks completely insane.
*  Was she taking her pants off?
*  She's got tattoos right next to her pussy.
*  Well, I mean, who doesn't?
*  Me.
*  Can't wait for spring.
*  Can't wait for spring.
*  What?
*  That's her catfans?
*  All the emojis.
*  All of the emojis.
*  Yeah, every emoji.
*  She's got, like, a shoe, an eggplant.
*  And look at that one there.
*  What's going on with this one?
*  Yeah, just point it.
*  2020, I will be doing a lot more acro yoga.
*  Let me hear this, please.
*  I'm going to open up my back and my chest.
*  And I'm out here with my dogs.
*  And we're going to have a beautiful day.
*  You just killed my fantasies.
*  She looks like a 70-year-old lady.
*  My babies.
*  What?
*  What is this?
*  What's going on?
*  This is acro yoga?
*  She just does that.
*  She looks crazy.
*  She'll walk through her house, and she
*  does these little fashion shows where
*  she'll put on her outfits and just spin around.
*  And you're just kind of like, what?
*  Doesn't she do a residency in Vegas?
*  No, she did.
*  What is she doing now?
*  She canceled her residency days before it was supposed
*  to open.
*  I have friends of mine who were supposed
*  to dance in her second residency that she was doing.
*  Days before, they canceled it, because that
*  was the whole thing.
*  Her dad said no.
*  Apparently, her dad even slapped one of her kids in front.
*  It was really fucked up.
*  Do you know this is true?
*  No, no.
*  This is all real.
*  It's out there.
*  No, no, no.
*  Oh, it's out there.
*  It's out there.
*  It's out there.
*  It's real.
*  Oh, it's real.
*  Yeah.
*  She does look kooky for Cocoa Puffs.
*  Yeah.
*  And so now, everyone wants her to like,
*  everyone's rooting for her and everything.
*  Everyone.
*  They are.
*  We're rooting for Britney Spears.
*  What's going on here?
*  She's in Hawaii.
*  It's my birthday, bitches.
*  How old is she?
*  She's probably 37, 38.
*  OK, she's bowling.
*  What happened to her butt?
*  Where'd it go?
*  Look at that.
*  She's going to bowl a strike.
*  Yay.
*  I know.
*  It's so sad.
*  But where was that going with this?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  She has like this hot 24-year-old boyfriend.
*  Good.
*  I hope she buys him a car.
*  Yeah, look at this guy.
*  He's a moose.
*  He's a handsome fellow.
*  He's an elk.
*  What's going on around his neck?
*  Is that a neck pillow for an airplane?
*  Does he just wear that everywhere?
*  Probably.
*  You have to take precautions.
*  If he gets sleepy, he leaves his head on that fucking neck
*  pillow.
*  God.
*  I mean, and that tree.
*  Come on.
*  She does look like she's out of her fucking mind.
*  Yeah.
*  So Bill Maher was right.
*  I'm sorry, Bill.
*  Yeah.
*  That one where she's doing the aqua yoga, that one was sad.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of them where you're just kind of like.
*  Crazy.
*  I know.
*  I mean, yeah, it's just a lot of head flips.
*  And then I, yeah.
*  Yeah, well, she's probably insane.
*  Wasn't she like 16 when she made it?
*  I mean, that's the story of Hollywood.
*  It's like you start out at like six, pump you full of pills,
*  and then.
*  You know who's all right, kind of, sort of?
*  Who?
*  Macaulay Culkin.
*  He's on the cover of a, what's it called, this, in March,
*  Vanity Fair.
*  They just released it this morning.
*  Esquire.
*  He looks good.
*  GQ.
*  Something like that.
*  Sports Illustrated.
*  Yeah, he's doing well.
*  Bears in Caves.
*  Bears in Caves.
*  He's in here.
*  Bow and a lower.
*  We had a real good conversation.
*  I really enjoyed his company.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  And he realizes Macaulay Culkin is not like you.
*  The 39-year-old.
*  Yeah, Esquire.
*  That's what it is, Esquire.
*  Call him Mac.
*  Esquire's March 2020 cover boy.
*  Has been liberated longer than it.
*  He's an interesting guy.
*  He really is.
*  I know he is.
*  He knows he's gone through something that you're not
*  supposed to go through.
*  Like, he knows.
*  He knows that he did something you're not
*  supposed to do.
*  He developed as a human being.
*  Oh, really gone.
*  In a gigantic population of people.
*  Like, everyone knew who he was.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's hugely famous when he was a little boy.
*  And that's not good for anybody.
*  Well, and people would see him on the streets
*  and be like, do the thing.
*  Do the thing.
*  I'm sure he still gets that.
*  And you can't say no.
*  They get fucking mad at you.
*  They want to kick you.
*  Yeah.
*  But Britney Spears, man.
*  Like, she was.
*  I know.
*  When did she make it?
*  How old was she?
*  She made it in 1999 was her first hit.
*  She was also on the Mickey Mouse Club before that.
*  She was in the Mickey Mouse Club with Justin Timberlake
*  and Jacey Chazee.
*  She's double, triple fucked.
*  She's fucked.
*  She looks crazy.
*  She's probably peeled up.
*  Probably got her on all kinds of stuff.
*  She had a show with her husband at the time called Chaotic
*  with Kevin Federline.
*  And they followed her around.
*  And she was like, yacked out of her mind.
*  He's one of those gold diggers on the male side.
*  We only have two.
*  Tim and Tom Arnold.
*  The real ones have made it.
*  We got two up on the board.
*  There are so many women who have made so much money off men
*  and divorces and only two men that I know of that have really
*  scored and scored well.
*  Who else?
*  Someone else?
*  Yes.
*  Anna Nicole Smith's ex.
*  Really?
*  I think so, yeah.
*  Kevin Federline's all fat now.
*  He's got a giant belly.
*  He just takes care of the kids.
*  He's got custody, too, which is not a good sign.
*  When the ex has custody and it's a guy,
*  that usually means you're a fuck up.
*  Or you've got some issues mentally.
*  So it's like, I mean, that's what happens.
*  Or you don't like kids.
*  You're like, OK, bro, you can have them.
*  That's what happens.
*  And here's a Ferrari.
*  It happened at Whitney Houston.
*  It happened at Michael Jackson.
*  It happened at Prince.
*  It happened at Amy Winehouse.
*  Michael Jackson, those are not his kids.
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you mean?
*  Oh, you mean going crazy.
*  I'm sorry.
*  It's like you go down that route.
*  You start taking fentanyl.
*  Well, I don't think anybody's supposed to be famous.
*  And I think being famous is probably
*  one of the weirder fucking things that
*  could happen to a human being.
*  And I think that as it's happening to you,
*  your reality distorts in a way that you don't have
*  normal interactions anymore.
*  And so then your foundation of who you are as a person
*  deteriorates.
*  Now, if you grow up that way, it's
*  even stranger because then your foundation never existed.
*  You never had a foundation.
*  You were always in this weird, strange world.
*  And then oftentimes it goes away.
*  Remember when Gary Coleman was a security guard
*  and people would show up at his job and mock him?
*  Ah.
*  He was just trying to get enough money to eat.
*  Well, it's like the, yeah.
*  Literally.
*  I mean, when you're working as a security guard,
*  you're getting what, $15 an hour if you're lucky?
*  You're just trying to eat.
*  That's all you're trying to do.
*  Or it's like that guy from Trader Joe's who
*  is on the Cosby Show.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  What's wrong with a guy trying to make a living?
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, look how gross he is.
*  It's like, no.
*  Do you do that to everybody that's
*  at the fucking Trader Joe's?
*  No.
*  You say hi.
*  You say hi, they bag your groceries, and it's fine.
*  But it's almost worse to have been someone
*  and then not be someone than it is to have never.
*  No, it is worse in people's eyes.
*  But it's that same thing.
*  It's like when people look at you when you're on television
*  and go, like, oh, fuck him.
*  You know, like what they were saying,
*  would people take shots at you?
*  Like, fuck him.
*  He's on TV.
*  I'll fucking take shots at him.
*  But then when you're not anymore and then
*  you have a regular job, then it's
*  like they have an extra desire to shit on you.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Those same kind of people.
*  It's power.
*  Yes.
*  It's gross.
*  Now they're doing better than you.
*  Visceral power, yeah.
*  Yeah, now they're doing better than you.
*  I got my own house.
*  Look at you, you fucking loser in your apartment.
*  I've got an ATM card.
*  I got everything.
*  You ain't got shit.
*  You used to be on TV.
*  That went away.
*  I bought a round of drinks.
*  I had a guy shit on me once.
*  He was working at the counter at a, not really,
*  behind the counter at a CVS.
*  And I couldn't figure out what he was trying to do.
*  But he's being rude to me.
*  The CVS.
*  He's like, he goes, hey, you're that guy from that show.
*  I go, yep.
*  He goes, what happened to that show, huh?
*  I'm like, what, Fear Factor?
*  I go, what do you think happened?
*  He goes, I don't know.
*  You tell me.
*  What happened to that show?
*  He's like, mean to me.
*  I go, it got canceled.
*  He's like, yeah.
*  I'm like, bro, you work in fucking CVS.
*  Yeah.
*  Relax.
*  What are you doing?
*  This is Fear Factor.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't go after him.
*  I was like, this is so ridiculous.
*  He was lucky I was high.
*  I was like, this is so weird.
*  Because he was literally trying to insult me,
*  not realizing that I had done things since.
*  I'm OK.
*  But to him, I'm not on TV anymore,
*  so I must be a fucking loser.
*  So he's trying to make me feel bad.
*  What happened to that show?
*  What happened?
*  What happened?
*  I wish I could tell you.
*  But it was weird.
*  I didn't do anything to you, man.
*  I just came here to buy gum or whatever the fuck I'm buying.
*  Yeah, can I have my mile long receipt?
*  Shut up already.
*  Why are you being weird with me?
*  But he was just a dick, a behind the counter dick.
*  Like, yeah, you used to be on TV, nothing anymore, huh?
*  A BTCD.
*  Behind the counter dick.
*  Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
*  People are weird with people that are successful.
*  There's a thing where they don't look that, in general, people
*  don't look to people that are doing well as inspiration.
*  They look at them with envy.
*  It's like a natural human instinct.
*  And it's that attack.
*  And that's where we're at now with cancel culture and stuff.
*  Oh, we want to see somebody stumble or fall.
*  Because if we do, we can drag them down.
*  And then we'll get, and if we see that, and if we post it,
*  then we'll get all the likes and the favorites and the retweets.
*  Look what I found.
*  Look what I did.
*  Look what I discovered.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck him.
*  Yeah, fuck him.
*  Yeah.
*  But they don't realize, oh, that shit's going to come back
*  around and get them.
*  It's going to come back and bite them in the ass.
*  El Khomeet with a sign of jalapenos.
*  It feels bad.
*  It just feels bad even when you're doing it.
*  You think you're going to, like if you say mean shit to people
*  that you don't even know, like, that can't feel good.
*  It seems like it would feel good.
*  But it doesn't feel good.
*  It's going to come back around on you.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird way, giving people the access
*  to things like social media.
*  It's a weird way to communicate.
*  And it's not natural.
*  And so many people will use it and abuse it.
*  So many kids use it and abuse it.
*  Oh my god.
*  And that's what's terrifying.
*  All those people being mean to you on your Instagram,
*  if you could find out what the median age and who these people
*  are and what their life was like,
*  you'd probably be like, oh, I don't even feel bad.
*  Yeah.
*  You're fucking 12.
*  Yeah.
*  Where are your parents?
*  And you're a 50-year-old loser.
*  And you know, where are your parents?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Do your parents even know you have an Instagram account,
*  you little fuck?
*  I mean, I've had instances where we started the show on Snapchat.
*  Because Snapchat, I guess, used to be like for nudes.
*  12-year-olds.
*  But you see it one time, and then it would go away.
*  So you could be like, here's my dick.
*  And you're like, oh.
*  And then it goes away.
*  But it doesn't go away.
*  Just screenshot it.
*  Well, but there was some times where it was like,
*  I had to call and be like, hey, no.
*  No.
*  I had a girl who had a dildo and was using it on herself.
*  You had to call them and say, don't let that happen?
*  I had to call whoever was in charge of the show.
*  I was like, hey.
*  Because Snapchat had just come out.
*  And I didn't know what the hell.
*  I'm like, I'm not the demographic of Snapchat.
*  But I was just kind of like, I felt bad.
*  Because I was like, clearly the girl didn't know.
*  Yeah, I was like.
*  How did she not know?
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Maybe she did know.
*  That's how she drums up customers.
*  But it was just, I mean, it was fucking disturbing.
*  Was it?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Was she going hard in the paint?
*  Oh.
*  Blah.
*  Yeah, but it was just like, ugh.
*  Where's your parents?
*  How old was she?
*  50?
*  Where's your parents?
*  They're dead.
*  Yeah.
*  They're trying to kill myself.
*  I'm trying to kill myself with this beer bottle.
*  She was young.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  A lot of people are bad parents, bro.
*  They do a terrible job.
*  Do you ever think you could adopt kids?
*  No.
*  Good for you.
*  Look at you.
*  I like how quick you answered.
*  No.
*  No.
*  It's not my thing.
*  Not even a cat, right?
*  No.
*  I'd have a cat.
*  Maybe a cat.
*  No kids for me, though.
*  Because you could leave town for a weekend with a cat,
*  just leave a lot of water and a lot of food.
*  It's got nine lives, yeah.
*  I don't think they really do.
*  No, they don't.
*  They're just flexible.
*  Yeah.
*  They can store on that body fat, you know?
*  Get a big fag.
*  So where are you doing this tour?
*  And where can people find out about it
*  if they want to come see you?
*  Actually, I'm doing a tour with Jim Jefferies.
*  So I'm doing his oblivious tour.
*  So you can check the dates.
*  I just did a thing at the Australia Fire Leaf.
*  We actually just came back from Houston and New Orleans,
*  and he had to go do that show.
*  Oh, really?
*  It was one downtown.
*  It was like when Kobe died.
*  Yes.
*  The day of.
*  The day of.
*  We were really bummed about that.
*  It was really weird.
*  We actually took off in the plane,
*  and we all got our CNN notifications.
*  And we all just sat there like, oh, shit.
*  Like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  It was pretty brutal.
*  I found out about it from Bert.
*  Bert, we have a group text going on.
*  Bert told me.
*  It was pretty gnarly.
*  And I just remember him being like, oh, man.
*  I've got to get the fuck downtown.
*  It's going to be crazy.
*  And it's like, yeah.
*  It was.
*  Yeah.
*  It was crazy.
*  I'm doing that with him all year.
*  And then, yeah, I got the show coming out on E in March.
*  It's called The Funny Dance Show now.
*  That's the dance-off thing.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Comics dancing off for $10,000 for a charity of their choice.
*  And I'm the judge.
*  Lonnie Love is on as a judge, and Allison Holker,
*  who is a dancer.
*  And they pick the song?
*  They have to practice?
*  Are they practicing?
*  They have to practice for like a week.
*  Oh, Christ.
*  And then, so we got like Ron Funches on it.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I love Ron.
*  We got like Ron Funches.
*  Ron Funch is the most positive comedian available today.
*  Isn't it nauseating?
*  No, he's great.
*  He's cultivating being nice and being positive.
*  And I really appreciate it.
*  I did his podcast that he does, and it just
*  felt like the warmest hug afterwards.
*  I was like, oh, I needed this in my soul.
*  That's what he's like.
*  He's genuinely like that.
*  He's such a nice guy.
*  Yeah, we've got him.
*  Cultivates him.
*  We have Fortune, Brad Williams.
*  I love Fortune.
*  It's a cool like.
*  I love Brad Williams too, but I mean,
*  just had to say I love Fortune.
*  Yeah, she's great.
*  I don't want to leave Brad out.
*  Wow.
*  I love Brad.
*  I mean, it's going to be really, really fun.
*  And then, yeah, I mean, you could find me
*  on Instagram at Justin Martindale.

*  Don't find me on Twitter because I'll block you.
*  Yeah, let's do it.
*  Are you blocking people as well?
*  I need to start, though.
*  Should be.
*  Yeah.
*  Why not just mute them?
*  I know.
*  Well, I'm just talking to the void.
*  That is fun.
*  Just scream.
*  Scream into the vortex.
