# Joe Rogan Experience #1465 - Tim Pool
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs_mDpIkUOY)
*  Three two one Tim Pooley madman. How's it going dude the ride that you made to get here?
*  You drove from the other side of the continent in a bug-out van well
*  I mean you've had guests on who've driven here. I drove here you drove here, but it took four days took four days
*  It's a different kind of drive. Have you ever done that before? Oh, yeah? Yeah, yeah, not in the van, but I've driven around the country
*  Too many times the vans pretty dope yeah, I'm impressed. I told you last year
*  Yes, I was getting the van and I got a bunch of people on Twitter making fun of me like oh
*  He's gonna get a bug up van. He's crazy. I got a van you got a bug out van
*  He's awesome living that thing oh totally dude this the solar power on it. Yeah last year forever. That's pretty amazing
*  I didn't know that you could power everything so you have a solar power
*  Roof panels that is is it less effective in like Jersey where it's cloudy right now
*  You know how much difference is it when it's cloudy. I mean several hours of magnitude
*  Yeah, yeah, I'd like barely work. I mean it works it works it works well enough, but right here works great right here
*  The Sun is so intense and just gnarly you go outside you can feel it on your skin. Yeah, my solar things like you're good forever
*  Don't worry turn the AC on full blast really if I so if I run the AC on full blast
*  It will probably last if I start when the Sun comes up
*  It may be like I don't know 14 hours Wow that's that's that's intense though man
*  AC if I use just the fan to get circulation I can play PlayStation I can watch movies
*  I can turn the music on full blast and you could probably with AC you could probably turn it on and off as the temperature goes
*  Up and down yeah, and the van is is it insulated at all. Oh man like crazy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
*  Yeah, these guys I was trying to find somebody to help me modify this thing for a while
*  I think when I was here last time I had the van
*  But it was empty and then I found these guys in in Jersey
*  They do like they do police modification stuff like gun racks and you know like seats
*  And I guess because the van life things started getting big they I did a Google search
*  I couldn't find anybody and life thing yeah van life man. What are you talking about? So on YouTube?
*  Vanlife was this big trend. I think it's kind of waning a little bit
*  But there was one woman who got like two million subscribers and one video
*  Because she lives in her van with her pet snake or something like that. Oh, she's probably hot is she hot
*  She's young at I think so I haven't actually seen the video
*  So I'm like making the assumption that you know that makes make a YouTube video
*  You're a single female in a van, you know, and I think the video was like here's how I shower so naturally
*  Oh, you get to know it's good move. Yeah, but they're
*  Masturbate four million views. Yeah. Yeah, these these guys over where I live
*  I guess I couldn't find anybody to do this the wait lists are crazy
*  Like they're pro companies that do van modification eight month wait period really
*  Yeah, so I went on Google Maps of all places just because I was like maybe maybe that's my problem
*  I typed in van modification and
*  Two miles from me. Boom. This guy pops up and he does him in his company
*  They did modifications for local police departments on like SWAT vans surveillance vans and things like that
*  I wonder if I'm supposed to be saying that probably not probably not but I didn't tell you to keep your mouth shut
*  No, actually he was like, yeah, let people know we do this work. You know, I mean, what's the name of the company?
*  Diversified vehicle systems, I think man if I got that name wrong, I feel so bad. Well, see if you find it Jamie
*  Yeah, diversified vehicle system sound or services
*  Yeah, and it's he's got cool photos of like SWAT vans and stuff
*  I'm stoked to do you know, he's he hooked me out that thing's amazing
*  It is interesting that you can power everything from the solar panels
*  You could power your monitors because you have it set up in there. We have monitors and lights you have cameras
*  What kind of do you have an internet connection?
*  I use my phones but but there is there is on the roof this thing called a wine guard and have
*  5g on your phone, right? You have the yep. Oh, yes. Here it is diversified vehicle services. That's him
*  That's that's that's the answer interior before the van heads to tie. Okay?
*  Yeah, you're making this guy's weak good. Good for him. He's cool, dude
*  Yeah, so how long did it take for them to trick it out?
*  I think it took like a maybe three weeks to a month and then felt super confident to drive that thing all the way across
*  Country totally was it weird at all?
*  No, it's pretty awesome. Was there any spots you stopped in you like what in the fuck like our barstow type type areas
*  There was just because like the pandemic and all that. Yeah. Well the pandemic and they're weird already
*  I've driven across this country too much. I've purposefully in the past have driven through really weird parts like off of interstate highways
*  I've been at some pretty crazy places
*  I went to I've been to one motel that once looked like used to be a prison or something
*  Used to be a prison they turn. No, no, I'm just saying it looked like
*  There's no windows. There's just like those block windows. You can't see through with like the weird wavy glass
*  I had no idea what the building used to be but it was a motel now
*  It looked like I was in a meat locker or something, but there was there's one town. I think it was in New Mexico
*  I don't want to say the name because I get it wrong
*  But they put up a sign saying no one's allowed in no but the whole town the whole town was because of the pandemic
*  Yep, no one's allowed. Can you do that? It said no visitors. No business something like that. It said it's like residents only
*  Is that legal I don't think it is that's where it's weird, right?
*  A lot of this stuff is like what what is legal as far as like as far as lockdowns
*  What's legal is it completely up to the there?
*  This is a debate right now, right whether or not it's completely up to the governor's whether it's the mayor's have individual liberty
*  Whatever town and I mean, I'll tell you what sounds like the Constitution doesn't exist right now
*  Well, I wouldn't go that far
*  Hyperbolic yeah, come on. There's definitely some
*  Protections, let's put it this way
*  Let's be as generous as possible protections that are in place to shield the vulnerable people from the pandemic
*  Yeah, but a lot of folks feel like there's some overstepping and there's a problem with power man
*  You give power to people they do not like to give it back. They always think it's better with me in charge
*  Yeah, that's what there was one documentary
*  I saw a long time ago some activists went to like the the CEO of shell and
*  He talked to him and he was like listen you got to understand. I'm trying my hardest with me at the helm
*  I'm doing such good things for the environment. They always think they're the benevolent dictator
*  That's why I think decentralization is so much more important in so many different aspects like yeah
*  That is a weird trait that human beings have when they get into a position like that, right?
*  Well the type of person who would want to be a governor to begin with type of person that would want to run the entire state
*  Yeah, I
*  Don't I don't trust any individual to have good intentions
*  I should say they do have good intentions, but I don't trust them to actually know what's best for everybody
*  There's no way you can I mean to be to be able to be accurate about all the different predictions in this in this regard
*  You know when you're talking about this pandemic thing
*  One of the biggest problems I'm looking at is who determines what's essential and what's not essential
*  Yeah, weed stores are essential. So we heard it like in in Michigan for instance
*  They were closing off certain parts of certain stores
*  Did you hear about this?
*  so a lot of people took it because there were photos of
*  Seeds at Walmart or something where there was like a tape saying you can't you know
*  This part of the store is closed and so the story went out that you weren't allowed to buy seeds anymore
*  the story actually was that
*  stores over 50,000 feet had to close off non-essential areas like flooring and gardening and things like that and
*  Who's to determine what isn't isn't essential about any of those services particularly gardening?
*  If there's a time where you want to have your own food readily available in your backyard now the time
*  Well even think about just general hardware if they're gonna shut that down
*  What if you what if a hole breaks open in your floor, you know, your kid falls through it or something?
*  You got that fixed. Yeah, I mean that's it. That's a serious safety issue
*  So you've got these governors determining what is essential and what isn't I heard a good argument for keeping liquor stores open?
*  Cuz I was like come on liquor stores
*  But someone said actually it is to prevent people from going into detox from having problems
*  Detoxing where they would take up a hospital bed that we need
*  Potentially need because of the virus. I that makes sense
*  I also think about the reality of you take away booze in a time of a crisis
*  Yeah, you're gonna see people's nerves snap real quick
*  Have you seen the video of this guy jogging down the street? He examines everybody's recyclables
*  No, it's all filled with vodka bottles and tequila and whiskey and wine and it's like
*  Goes from house to house. He's like, let's see what they've been up to. Oh, well people are so stressed out. They're just getting hammered
*  Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of liver damage when this is all a lot of horses, too
*  Yeah, I heard that's that's going up. Oh, yeah people and domestic abuse and things like that and suicide
*  Here's here's the prediction. I made you know, very early on I was talking to my friends. Actually, I think I said this
*  What they're gonna do they're gonna say we're only gonna keep things closed until April 12th
*  And that's what Trump said at first Easter
*  We're gonna come open up and I said about a week before they're gonna say well, we got to push it back
*  Sure enough April 30th then May 15th. Now, it's June 1st. They're gonna first for who?
*  We just said I think New York just announced this they said June 1st
*  Yeah, but I think they said they're gonna start May 15th with outside of New York City, right?
*  There's not a lot of said I'm not entirely sure but feel like he said
*  They're gonna start you know, a lot of jurisdictions have slowly entered
*  There was that Trump argument with with camp in in Georgia about going too fast and stuff like that
*  Yeah, so I guess you know people starting to realize if you don't open things up. There's nothing to save right? Right?
*  What's what's freaking to me about all of this is the tribalism behind whether or not we should reopen the economy or stay locked down
*  It's connected to everything right? What do you mean the tribalism? It's kind of totally totally
*  Yeah, it's it's it's so, you know, I had a friend messaging me saying
*  We're stupid people who want haircuts are gonna get us all killed and they're going out and protesting and and the first thing
*  I'm like you really don't think just because one guy was holding that dumb sign. That's what everyone is thinking, right?
*  No, that's not the case
*  But what's crazy to me is you had the UN a UN advisor come out and say we're looking at
*  130 million people are going to starve because of the economic shutdown and that's gonna be much worse
*  potentially than the actual pandemic itself and these kind of facts are ignored because of the tribalism of what's happening
*  You know Trump tweets it out. Therefore. It's an hour right left, you know conservative whatever
*  I don't think they know exactly what to do. I mean, I think there's some educated
*  Decisions that are being made by medical professionals and then they have to adjust those based on new statistics that come in and I don't
*  know if they have adjusted like the the initial idea was that there was an X amount of people that were infected in California
*  Yeah, it turns out there's many many many more and the most recent thought is that there's somewhere around
*  400,000 now there has been some dispute about these studies, you know
*  Whether or not these studies are accurate whether or not the tests are accurate whether or not you could get it again
*  Whether or not even matters if you've already had it you might be able to get it again
*  But there's no adjustments. No one's saying hey, this is way less deadly than we thought it was going to be
*  You know, there's this sounds like the problem of government. Yeah, I've never been one of these
*  Small government types I'm you know as much as people might want to argue with me
*  I lean a little bit left on a lot of issues like government programs
*  I think are good things it just seems like whenever the government enact something
*  It's so slow to fix it if it goes bad or when things change, right?
*  So so to adjust if they need to shift back they tend to just dump more money into it if it's not working properly
*  I want to know why some people just shake this off
*  That's to me the most for this. It almost seems like you're dealing with more than one virus
*  It's like you're dealing with a bunch of different versions of a virus. I think you are
*  I think they've they've said they found multiple strains like that. It's changed a little bit or something
*  Mm-hmm. I don't want to try over sure. I know they did say that about India
*  They said that the strain that they have in India is apparently very different than the strain. They're experiencing in Europe
*  Yeah, I think some I heard something similar about like Washington. They found two strains
*  Liberal and conservative strain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's the crazy thing to me is the people a lot of Trump supporters
*  I don't want to I'm not trying to blanket every single one
*  but there's some high-profile ones that are really acting like since the beginning they've doubted it every step of the way and
*  I'm like have you looked at the spike charts if you know, here's what I say if in New York City
*  We're seeing thousands more dead. What are they dying of if not some kind of you know?
*  Infection, I mean you can call whatever you want. You can act like nothing's going on
*  But we're seeing huge spikes and you can't pay attention to them. There's fools. No matter what you do
*  There's always gonna be fools. So, you know, it's obviously a real virus. It's obviously real dangerous. It's the tribalism
*  Yeah, it's foolish. Yeah, it's it. You know, you got to just dismiss that stuff. You can't even
*  Debate or dwell on it, but what's interesting to me is
*  Well, there's a bunch of parts that are interesting, but what's interesting to me is like who?
*  Like George has opened right and then parts of Montana have opened
*  Things that have opened in Texas
*  Yeah
*  like it's gonna be interesting to see what the response is going to be whether or not they come back online quicker and their
*  economy builds up quicker or whether or not they get a second surge and they have to shut down longer and it winds up being
*  That maybe you should have waited longer and would have had less infection like we just saw a city of 10 million in China
*  Enter lockdown again did to what degree I don't I'm not entirely sure but they've announced
*  You know re-upping all the social distancing measures and certain closures and stuff like that and they're saying it's because
*  Someone a student I think they're saying a student from the US came back. Of course. They're saying right right right reignited it
*  Yeah, but there's also a bunch of studies now about reinfection. Yeah, you know
*  It's a whole lot of we don't know and everyone's freaking out
*  Whenever there's a new disease and everybody's got a scramble in real time to try to figure out what the fuck to do about it
*  And man just weirded out everybody's weirded out, you know, no one knows like what is normal now
*  What is what is reality the reality we live in like you see movies now when people hug or shake hands and you're like, ah
*  What are you doing? I've been watching these commercials you see these commercials
*  They're all the same where it's like it's like we're all in this together
*  And then it shows people banging pots and pans and it's like we may not be able to hug anymore
*  But the love is there it's like no Christ all identical
*  But then all of a sudden an older commercial pops up and I was watching this the other day and it's like a guy walks
*  Up shakes his buddy's hand pats him on the back and then like gives his wife a kiss in the cheek
*  And I'm like that's an old commercial that is I can tell it's an old campaign
*  Yeah, because they would not do that most of them are old because you can't shoot anything anymore
*  Yeah, you know, I don't know how I'm curious how they're doing these commercials where they film New York
*  I guess they're going out in New York and filming people actually, you know cheer from their balconies and stuff
*  Yeah
*  Look, you know, I think
*  There's a real there's a real tough question. Nope that a lot of people want to ignore
*  I think there's a lot of Trump supporters who are pushing it because they're in favor of reopening the economy
*  But there's like that equation of at what point is having things shut down more damaging than you know
*  So at a certain point we have to recognize people are gonna die no matter what we do. Well, there's a Bloomberg
*  Not not the mayor but there's a Bloomberg statistic on
*  The economy that measures the downside like when when the economy goes down
*  How many people die because of it and it's you could kind of trace it. It's it's very disturbing and
*  When we're talking about deaths we're talking about there's something that we can immediately deal with it's right in front of us
*  It's a disease that's happening right now go after it stop it
*  but the
*  Secondary reaction to that in fact because you're closing the economy might wind up killing as many people as you're trying to avoid being
*  Killing in the long run or yeah or more. Yeah, so I don't know the the UN's the big story on the UN was that their advisor said
*  235 million starving, you know in the next year or so unless things kick back into gear
*  Well, hopefully they are gonna kick back in the year. California is supposed to open up on May 15th, but the governor has been I
*  Don't I don't know if he enjoys it, but it seems like he seems like they they
*  Definitely are comfortable with being the person they get to say. Yeah, this is shut down and we're gonna keep it shut down
*  Dude the the authoritarianism is scary
*  We're the rest and people for fucking going to the park with their kids
*  Yeah
*  You see that tweet from the UK where they posted the shadows of the two cops and it was like think going into a rural area
*  To have a picnic is you'll get away with it. We're gonna look out of the shadows and find you know, what I swear to God
*  Yeah, it went viral
*  You're in the middle of no having a picnic go for it. Here's the thing man. They told fucking China shit, you know
*  That is like fuck man
*  Well now there is another story Bill Gates apparently said, you know China did a bunch of things, right?
*  and now what they're doing is they're taking that quote and they're putting it next to pictures of them welding doors shut and
*  Barricading people hanging out with Epstein. Oh probably that's the latest thing is I've been getting really don't like that guy
*  Well, these people are sending me all these videos about Bill Gates and how he used to party with Epstein
*  You know a lot of people did yeah, I wonder how many of them knew
*  About a lot of them apparently traveled with Epstein after Epstein had been and convicted. Oh man
*  Yeah, apparently like a couple years after he'd been convicted. It wasn't like he didn't know about it. Right, right
*  Have you seen Bill Gates Instagram? No all the comments just flooded with people saying like
*  globalists and Illuminati kind of stuff
*  That's I heard about that. Yeah a lot of pedophile stuff, too, right there
*  I don't know
*  I don't want to I know this is gonna be really touchy because you got a lot large with really angry people
*  They're saying things like take your vaccines back. We don't want them. We won't wear the mark of the beast
*  You know man, he's talked about you know what China did there
*  They're giving you these codes on your phone and you've got if you want to leave if you leave the town it becomes void
*  And so if you're in the city, then you can go to a building
*  They scan it to see if you're clear and if you are then you're able to come in. Yeah, fuck all that
*  Seriously, I think I you know man the amount of people I've seen argue in favor of this executive
*  You know these like these executive orders is pretty scary. Yeah, I've been scared about that
*  We've been talking about that quite a bit lately where I've been saying you can't have
*  massive
*  Overreaching government surveillance as a response to a disease you can't because they're not gonna shut it off
*  Once the disease has a vaccine they're gonna keep that stuff in place
*  And you are giving up a massive part of what it means to be an American
*  We'll take it free take a look at the the social media what's going on with you know Twitter Facebook
*  They you the CEO of YouTube will start there said on on CNN
*  Basically anyone who says anything out of line with the World Health Organization is a bit. It's banable. It's against our community guidelines
*  The World Health Organization has flipped flat back and forth, you know, like several times
*  Well, they've they're clearly spouting out Chinese propaganda to protect particularly in January when they were saying that
*  According to China. There's no evidence that you can be transmitted from person to person
*  And did you know the AP reported at that time China knew and withheld the information for six days
*  So the day that the World Health Organization tweeted out no evidence according to China of human human transmission
*  We now know according to the AP that China did know and purposefully withheld that
*  What you've got going on with China right now
*  I question whether or not we're getting close to an act of war and I know that might be a little exaggerated
*  But they've got you know, this is the story was published in BuzzFeed News
*  Trolls working either for China or within China trying to slow down the response in other regions like Spain Italy Taiwan
*  I think I think that the buzzfeed was specifically about Taiwan
*  Sowing disinformation so it would slow their response things like that. Why?
*  Well, I think China wants Taiwan right? Well that they don't like their rogue province. So they consider it
*  Yeah
*  Well, that's why they had instructed the World Health Organization not even mentioned the name Taiwan
*  You saw that video videos crazy whether the head of the World Health Organization is being interviewed and in the interview the woman
*  Asked him about Taiwan's response and he says I think China's done a great job
*  Right and then at first he ignores us and then he hangs up on her
*  He hung up Wow
*  But he did say China and she said Taiwan in specific and yeah
*  I think that's when he hung up on her and then he came back said well and she goes well
*  Let's get back to the question. Well, I think we've already covered it China's done a great job
*  Like he's clearly avoiding but why does he think he can do that? Like what what what does China have on them?
*  Money, is it fun? Is it China funding them?
*  I mean you saw what happened with the NBA and like desert. Yeah people don't want to get that cold hard cash
*  They're making a bold bet. You know what I mean?
*  Do you know what?
*  Thucydides trap is no
*  So this is I was reading about this the Atlantic wrote about this in 2015
*  Are we headed for a war with China and
*  Thucydides trap says that whenever a growing power seeks to upset the dominant power
*  It results in war and out of 12 out of 16 times of the past 500 years. It has happened
*  so
*  People have been predicting a US-China war for a really long time because of this historical precedent
*  It's not absolute, but it looks like
*  I'm not gonna like I'm historical expert or anything like that, but it looks extremely probable to me
*  I thought a lot of people get mad at me saying that I was fear-mongering by bringing this up
*  But the US just sent two warships into the South China Sea, which China considers their own territory
*  When you look at what China's been doing in terms of misinformation clearly lying about the numbers that you know
*  They're I can't remember who did this
*  I think it may have been Germany removing China's numbers from the charts saying they're not real
*  So China's been misleading the rest of the world withholding information on how bad the infection is
*  They sent a strike group an aircraft carrier through the South China Sea near Taiwan putting Japan on alert
*  The US's aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt was disabled because of the coronavirus
*  They evacuated 80% of the personnel the US doesn't what they call an elephant walk in Guam where they have all these bombers
*  Then the US pulls them out because apparently China's got some kind of weapon that can just blanket Guam and wipe out our forces
*  Next thing I know we sent what kind of weapon they have they can do that. It's I'm not entirely sure
*  I'm you know, I'm getting my information from just reading peripheral stories
*  I'm not a military, you know guy anything like that, but it really does
*  You know, so the US just sent two warships into the South China Sea and I think they're doing this because
*  One of the things I read from a military website was that the strike force is testing US resolve
*  The last time that China has done this where they sent a strike force around Taiwan actually tried to you know
*  Take it in some fashion the US sent a couple super carriers and everything calmed down
*  Now our super carriers in the region were disabled by kovat. Well, didn't China
*  Didn't they go into a group exercise with Iran after we we killed that guy
*  Oh, I don't know. Yeah, there was a group exercise with China and Iran
*  In the sea that they did something like some sort of show of unity right after
*  Trump had that guy assassinated. Do you see what happened with those Iranian gunboats?
*  They were swarming us the US naval vessels and then Trump ordered them if they do it again
*  Sink them blow them up
*  Do you know that Venezuela tried commandeering a civilian yacht a couple weeks ago?
*  What Venezuelan naval ship crashed into a German owned private cruise liner?
*  They were trying to count as my understanding of the story because I know a lot of people are they're not gonna want to pride that
*  Analysis out they were trying to steal it. So they claim deal it
*  Yeah
*  they so I think the official word from Venezuela was they thought this was a
*  Fake cruise ship with assassins from Maduro or something
*  So they ordered it to come into their their waters because they weren't
*  Venezuela Venezuelan naval ships are ramming it sank itself. Yeah, I heard about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and so then sometime after
*  Donald Trump deploys to US naval vessels to near Venezuela near Venezuelan waters, which he says are for drug related operations
*  I'm not gonna like I know a lot of people are gonna get heated saying, you know, you're talking about
*  Yeah, yeah
*  All I know is that's what was reported who knows what that means or what it leads to but needless to say
*  With it, you know, look Russia is withholding wheat exports several European countries have have closed their borders within the Schengen area
*  They're withhold their their people are trying to hoard food and we just had a full page ad in in the New York Times Sunday edition
*  I think was from Tyson saying the food supply chain is breaking and we're getting ready for a major shortage of food
*  Yeah, they had to kill two million chickens. Wow, cuz they didn't have anybody to butcher them
*  Here's here's here's my concern when you have these nation-states shoring up their borders
*  Even within the European Union that was crazy to me when you see Germany and France and Austria closing their borders to each other
*  Then you get these warships making these movements you get people desperate for food. You see Venezuela ramming into a cruise ship
*  I say this it could be that we're hyper focused on it because we're bored
*  We don't only pay attention to this stuff. We normally pay attention to celebrity gossip and politics now that we're not doing anything
*  we're really focused on what's happening in international territory or
*  Perhaps it's that we're getting desperate and we're scared as the economy tanks
*  Well, if it wasn't for mutually assured destruction, I would say yeah, we're probably moving into a place of war
*  But you have two nuclear superpowers like China and the US
*  It's like what you know, what do they do? What are you gonna do?
*  You're gonna one guy gonna launch a missile the other guy's gonna launch a missile
*  Like what are they gonna do? Yeah, are they gonna go into a full-scale war and wipe out everyone on the planet?
*  Cuz that's what would happen. I think so
*  I do the thing is who would be more willing to wipe out a giant chunk of the population?
*  Would it be China or would it be the United States? I don't think it be the United States
*  I think it'd be China and I think it really depends on how strained they are for resources and whether or not they're really going to lose
*  the difficult
*  Look in China when this broke out what we saw videos of them barricading people in their homes welding their doors shut
*  Yeah, the doctor whistleblower. There's one story of viceran a journalist was calling out all of these things disappears for a month
*  Comes back a month later. I'll have be like governments great. We love them. Really? Yeah
*  We know we know what they do. We've seen we've seen videos now. This could be propaganda, you know, cuz I'm in America
*  So, of course, I'm getting this information
*  Maybe the US is trying to you know build this up
*  but I think you take a look at that kind of behavior the willingness to do anything by any means necessary and
*  At what point do you get one person who's in charge saying I will not be the captain of a ship that sinks
*  You know, I look to
*  Well, I don't want to get super political in American history
*  But I view it as you've got a leader of a country and as people are looking at him
*  He says this will be the year my country ceases to exist F that presses a button. I
*  Will not be the lead, you know, I will not be the person with it staying
*  It's hard to know though because it could be a leader saying I will not be the person who destroys the world
*  I would rather go down in history as the you know failure of my country
*  I I think you back somebody into a corner and you get fight-or-flight
*  I don't trust Trump's Trump's decision-making in that regard either. No, I don't you know
*  I just I don't trust anybody's decision-making but anybody who won't admit
*  That he said one thing when we saw it like this whole injecting disinfection
*  Maybe oh the fact that he said he was being sarcastic
*  That was so dumb and if you're that same person and then we want you to be in charge of this decision
*  Whether or not we go to war. I mean obviously you have to have the support of Congress, but this but you know this this you know
*  the disinfectant story is
*  The one of the weirdest and most difficult things to actually grasp. I think you just got caught rambling
*  That's it. You have to the episode of South Park where Cartman pretends like he has Tourette's
*  So so Cartman finds out that people with Tourette's just say all these things
*  So he's like if I pretend to have this I can say whatever I want and then eventually he loses his filter and starts saying
*  A bunch of ridiculous things like he starts admitting to like, you know touching his cousin or something camp and he's like
*  Why am I saying this? Oh, no, I've lost my filter
*  Donald Trump that's what he here's how I see it
*  He heard something from these experts he didn't understand it he has no filter and so he just asked this thing
*  Here's here's my challenge with it. Is there such thing as a stupid question
*  Yes, there is can you eat glass? Right? That's a stupid question. I don't some like performers eat glass
*  They don't really they don't really do they well, so they chew up candy glass. Yeah, here's here's here's here's the struggle. Here's a struggle
*  What is a disinfectant?
*  How do you interpret what he said and here's what Trump supporters immediately fired back with there is
*  H202 nebulization therapy and they they pulled up an article from it was posted msn.com
*  April 10th
*  One of the treatments they're looking at for kovat is to take hydrogen peroxide through a nebulizer into your lungs
*  That's a disinfectant into your body for a cleaning. I
*  Don't think Trump was going for that
*  I think the guy mentioned we have bleach and alcohol and Trump was like I wonder if you could you know
*  Possibly getting their body through an injection as a cleaning. Yeah, right. Look well
*  What's really interesting that came out of this was Twitter banned an account
*  That is a publicly traded biotech account that has a legitimate therapy
*  Yep, when someone has been incubated when they've been when they're on a respirator
*  They can send UV light through that tube and actually kill some of the bad bacteria in the lungs
*  The video that shows how they do it shows like the tube and this like some animated thing which shows the lungs
*  They banned them right they banned a publicly traded biotech company
*  Which is just I don't know if they banned them because they think that in some way this supports
*  What Trump was saying or if someone just pulled the trigger too quickly? I mean who's doing this over here?
*  I think you have a bunch of fucking kids that are making decisions whether or not something gets banned or not something gets reported
*  Like someone report. I'm just guessing some reports that says look these fucking idiots are saying that Donald Trump's right
*  You can get light in there ban it. They count nuke it. We sat here. Yes with Jack and Vidya Vidya and
*  I don't think we got a definitive answer necessarily. We got a you know, thank you for your feedback
*  I think we got an answer in terms of what Jack wants in terms of
*  He I think Jack is a legitimately honest guy
*  Who is trying to manage things at scale and I think that's almost impossible
*  I don't the sheer numbers that are coming in and he's trying to do a Wild West Twitter now
*  This is his concept of having a Twitter. That's just wide open
*  We could do anything and then having like a regular sort of moderated Twitter
*  There's a there's a name I can say right now a name if I say a name right now
*  Candyman this this video will be pulled from YouTube
*  I
*  Can say one guy's name Alex Jones no, I'm not don't don't say it if you know it is don't say it
*  I'm not gonna start with I
*  Don't think I should even do that really I've had my video taken down and I've been told to write it down here
*  Write it down for me. You sure? Yeah, right. Yeah, just write it down
*  If you say this name your video will be taken out. They take it out C-SPAN. They've taken down Fox News really
*  I
*  Said Hitler no
*  I'm warning you not to say this name the company's been
*  Unsuspended if you will unsuspend for that so yeah, so somebody probably fucked up. There's probably a kid that my handwriting is awful
*  That's okay. Do not say that name. I'm not kidding with you man. Do not say that name I
*  Don't even know who that is. He is the he's a I can I can describe him to you. He's a CIA
*  He worked he worked for the CIA guess
*  He is accused of being the whistleblower
*  The Ukraine whistleblower oh and if you say his name you will get taken down Wow
*  This is that so that seems like news
*  How come news will get you taken down?
*  Yeah, makes you wonder right how come a biotech company with a legitimate product gets taken down now you I guess it was restored
*  Yeah, I think that biotech company somebody fucked up
*  I think I think you have too many I think from what Adam Curry was explaining to me
*  Is that there's a bunch of kids that work for?
*  Twitter and they work for a lot of these other companies
*  And they're they're the ones responsible for whether or not something gets banned or something gets taken down
*  You know the Zuby story the okay, dude story right right right which is just bonkers. Let's let's for people so this can be standalone
*  Zuby who is a British guy we've talked about this on the podcast where he's been a guest in the podcast. He's a rapper
*  very very
*  Intelligent interesting guy doesn't even swear. He's very polite. He's a really nice guy
*  So he gets in some sort of an interaction with someone on Twitter and this person says I bet I sleep with more women
*  Than you he says okay, dude. That's it. He got a new band
*  Band he got suspended for a long period of time like weeks or whatever the fuck it is
*  I don't know how long you get suspended for something like that
*  But then he asked for it to be reviewed and they upheld it
*  Yeah, they said yes, you can't say oh, okay, dude now
*  I don't know if he was talking to a trans woman didn't either yeah, he didn't either yeah
*  He didn't know is that what it is is that what the case was I?
*  That's my understanding of the story. Yeah, well he didn't even know right. He just saw someone and said okay, dude
*  You know the problem is this idea of approved truth what YouTube calls authoritative sources, so I know I'm pretty hard on YouTube
*  But this doesn't involve Facebook as well that name
*  I sent you Facebook will delete your post without notice if you type it Wow so here's what I did tried it
*  I typed I just I said something like I heard of a man from Dubuque an orthodontist name
*  Who has five kids and he's in his mid-50s
*  I did that because that in no way describes who that person is right not not only to Facebook delete it
*  They deleted it without telling me it was just erased from the site gone
*  So it's some sort of filter that's in place no no somebody manually did it it was there for a while
*  And then somebody came in or somehow so so do you know what happened with CNN Chris Cuomo getting getting kovat?
*  You know they faked that whole thing right what do you mean they faked it?
*  So Chris Cuomo was spotted 30 minutes from his house on a property with a new cop with a new construction being built
*  Yes, a steel frame a guy on a bike saw him Chris Cuomo
*  They got into it Chris Cuomo goes on his radio show and says I don't want this jackass on a fat tire bike coming up
*  To me I should tell him what I want the guy on the bike says he called the cops and said he threatened me
*  So this basically confirms the encounter
*  Chris Cuomo then then shot a segment for CNN of him emerging from his basement like this is what I've been dreaming of finally
*  Getting out of my basement my kids, but he was witnessed seeing his kids somewhere else with his kids
*  Yeah, so you even had that you even had Ben Smith the New York Times
*  Called this out saying Ben Smith used to be the editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed news now
*  He's a media columnist for New York Times said something the effect of it's it's like shocking how CNN is aligning this whole controversy
*  They're they're kind of like it didn't happen everybody knows Cuomo faked it. Yeah, he wasn't in quarantine
*  He was out presumably he was he was with two women and three kids so we can we can assume it was his wife and his kids
*  Whatever I bring that up because you've got a couple other moments right you've got Brian Stelter on
*  On his show saying that we got to channel the anger for the people
*  Yeah, that he was saying that journalists need to do that. Yep, which is which is you know, I basically said so you're admitting your rage bait
*  Well, yes, I saw you did that and I was glad that you said that like finally they're admitting it right right right
*  I mean look, it's no secret. I'm gonna rag on the media
*  I worked for these companies and I've seen them slowly getting worse and worse with everything. I want to see Brian scream
*  You want to see Brian scream? Yeah, I think like him enraged would be adorable
*  Like I don't I wonder how much anger he can muster. I can't I can't so what so here's here's a point
*  I was getting to
*  CNN's called an authoritative source. Yeah, they're lying in our faces
*  I mean you just had the Joe Biden thing for I don't know if you've talked about this yet
*  But if you go to Google Play and look up Larry King's show from 1993 you will see there
*  So actually I checked many of the different months
*  What people noticed was that one episode was missing August 11th 1993 the episode
*  Where Joe Biden's accuser called in saying my daughter had a problem with a prominent senator. No, it was Joe Biden's
*  Accusers mom the accuser. Yeah. Yeah, what did I say? I said accuser. All right. Yeah, he's accused. He's his mom, right?
*  That episode's gone. Yes
*  So I went through Google Play and there certainly were other episodes that were presumably missing
*  Typically Mondays where I was soon
*  I would assume that you know Larry King had a day off or something. The 11th was a Wednesday. Why was this missing?
*  Why did CNN why were they scooped on their own story? They had this evidence apparently this was this was news
*  So when you look at what CNN's been doing admitting that they're doing rage journalism you get people like Jim Acosta
*  But isn't that like what's what Brian said what's Brian Seltzer?
*  So doesn't Lester Stelter isn't he just that is that that's his own opinion, you know
*  I mean, it's not that they're admitting that they're doing rage journalism
*  It's he's saying that they should do that. Right? Isn't that what it was? He said it on Twitter, right? Yeah
*  Yeah, I think it was a quote from his show was it I think it was reliable sources tweeting it out
*  Yeah, and you know, look I may be hyperbolic or whatever because I got my opinions on on CNN and all that
*  But take a look at someone like Jim Acosta
*  He stands up. He argues with the president. That's not what journalists are supposed to do
*  You know if you want to ask the president a question
*  He gives you an answer if he if you have the opportunity for a follow-up you do and then you write your story
*  And you fact-check him you write your story and say Donald Trump. Here's what he told us. Here's the truth
*  That's what journalists used to do now
*  You've got this idea of channeling the rage for the people what that means is it's something I've seen in activist circles
*  Where I was explained to me that what people are looking for is someone to strike down a symbol of what they view as
*  Their enemy or the cause of their problems. So the reasons why someone like Jim Acosta would do so well
*  He would get so many followers constantly doing this
*  It's not that he's asking any real questions or actually challenging the president
*  It's that the people who don't like Trump see him as striking a symbol down
*  It doesn't matter if he's telling you the truth or not
*  Now you get performative journalism where Chris Cuomo pretends to come out of his basement
*  Where you know you get people standing up at the White House correspondents
*  At the press conferences just arguing instead of actually asking questions and then YouTube Facebook and Twitter say this is the truth
*  We deem it so YouTube now puts them among other outlets on the front page of the website guaranteeing hundreds of millions of views
*  meanwhile
*  Independent commentators like myself. We actually get hurt in the algorithm if you go to my channel
*  They only show you Fox News if you want to watch me
*  Then you are guaranteed in the sidebar. The next video will be Fox News
*  They prop up all of these channels David Pakman for instance. You get MSNBC Jimmy Dore Fox News. I
*  Don't understand why they're gonna send Jimmy's, you know lefty followers to Fox News
*  But they're doing seemingly everything their power to make sure
*  Individuals like myself and other commentators are struck down while channels like CNN Fox and MSNBC are propped up
*  Even though we know that they put out fake news
*  But isn't that but because of the algorithm though and do you think that algorithm is engineered in order?
*  It was engineered towards those mainstream side. Absolutely. We can see we can see when it happened. It was May of last year
*  You I've looked at my analytics around the time these smear pieces came out arguing that there was a rabbit hole
*  where if you watch one kind of contents all you get it's a very very misleading way of framing what was really going on and
*  So I I'm surprised that YouTube just bent over for this
*  You basically have YouTube's competition these media outlets using their media weight to hurt YouTube in ad sales
*  So YouTube says you got it will give you front page access will guarantee you, you know
*  People watch your content right but they're doing that because that content is very popular and that generates ad revenue
*  Well, I would I would I would say no actually I would argue against that well, okay
*  But listen like Tucker Carlson, for example, you gotta know he's hugely popular
*  Absolutely, if you have a Tucker Carlson video it's gonna generate millions of you. Absolutely. So you do within their best interests
*  I'm talking about Allison Camerota. Is anybody really Google searching you on YouTube Allison Camerota's opinion on this day
*  I don't think so. I think I don't know who that is. All right, exactly. And so you wouldn't be searching for it Tucker
*  Of course, we know
*  You're saying it's the channel in general not just someone who's popular like Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson
*  They as as very famous personalities very obviously do get you know more get more naturally
*  Yeah, so people are searching for Tucker all day and night Hannity and Rachel Maddow things like that, right?
*  But if you if you look at how what YouTube has even said to CNN, they prop up authoritative sources
*  Yes, if you search for a news story, guess who you're gonna get if you Google search, you know, Tara Reid Joe Biden
*  You're gonna get CNN. Do you think that they're doing that though because they're trying to get rid of
*  Conspiracy theories. Yes. Yeah, they're trying reason. Yeah, they're trying to get like I understand what they're saying in terms of
*  So like the CEO of YouTube when she said that they're gonna go with the World Health Organization
*  I don't think it's a good idea to go with the World Health Organization because it seems like it's a very corrupt organization
*  But I do understand this desire to go towards
*  respected and established medical professionals
*  I agree for step respected and established medical professionals have a protocol for dealing with coronavirus
*  We should listen to them. Right? Yeah, absolutely
*  And there's a lot of wacky fucks online that are trying to say that it's not a real virus and that it's 5g
*  And there's all like all that kind of stuff is dangerous. You know what they told me don't you think absolutely? Absolutely
*  But they told me
*  They published editorial guidelines very early on I did a video about this January 23rd when they first started locking down
*  I did a segment talking about what's going on and I actually didn't think it was a big deal
*  This was before anybody was really covering it. I mean, this is you know impeachment was happening and
*  YouTube fully monetized it can so I have a thing on YouTube called self certification
*  Where when I upload a video they ask me do your does your video contain any of the following?
*  My videos are always clean family-friendly. I don't swear and
*  I was approved video monetized a week later. They implemented a new change without telling anyone
*  Anything anyone talking about coronavirus was instantly demonetized D ranked
*  Possibly had your videos harder to find things like that and it wasn't until about a couple weeks ago
*  They overturned these D rankings on my channel
*  They told me before they published the guidelines
*  You cannot say these things one of which was that it may have emerged from a biolab
*  Now we have on April I think I think it was the 16th a former Clinton administration
*  NSC staffer saying that Occam's razor suggests the most likely place that this came from was breaking out of a Wuhan biolab
*  There was a story by Brett Bayer over at Fox News where he said according to sources
*  He has who've overseen the documents
*  They believe that China was trying to essentially prove their their their worth with American bio research
*  By racing to do this development and there was a breach and this resulted in in the covert outbreak
*  That's that's Fox News and CNN CNN's run multiple segments saying this when I talk about it
*  I get D ranked demonetized confirmed. They say you can't talk about this Tim CNN can they're authoritative
*  You can't even if I use them as a source
*  Even if I say like so if I what I try to do is you know, weigh the sources. How good are they?
*  Brett Bayer, that's a good source
*  I mean Brett Bayer is one of the last true news people
*  I don't I'm not somebody who follows him too much, but he's a straight news guy
*  He put his name on this and that that says a lot to me
*  You don't gotta like the guy you got like Fox News
*  But CNN also ran the story saying US intelligence now believes or I'm sorry
*  They're investigating whether this claim is it has merit
*  We also had a story from the Washington Post that asked the same question
*  Even got a professor from Rutgers University to say it's very possible
*  The story actually emerged because at South China University
*  Was it I think South China University in Beijing released a paper saying that somebody was doing experiments on bat bats with coronavirus
*  And one of the bats spilled blood on him and peed on him and he had a self quarantine for 14 days
*  Being that the Wuhan CDC. I think it's a CDC is about you know, 300 meters away from the from the food market
*  It seems like that was a likely scenario. They eventually retract that retracted that paper. It's a fucking movie scene. Totally. So look
*  It's not it's not me saying it. I understand what you're saying, but you know, but I get I get knocked down for this
*  I understand about it. I understand but I think in their defense
*  Some of this has to be that they're managing at scale
*  I agree some of this has to be the fact that millions of videos are uploaded every day and they have to keep this dense
*  Disinformation from spreading out of control when you have all these fucking nutjobs are saying this is 5g
*  It's not even a virus. It's radiation sickness
*  Someone sent me a guy that I really like sent me this video of this doctor that seems like he's got schizophrenia or something
*  He's talking about this is a plasma disease caused by radiation and I'm like, oh fucking Christ. You imagine
*  I've gotten so many people hitting me up Tim. You got to talk about 5g. Oh god
*  You know how many people hit me up when 4g came out? Listen 5g is a thing, right? It's a it's a new
*  bandwidth for cell phones, it's going to be
*  Really fast it's going to be in your phone. So the question is like, okay all this stuff's flying through the air
*  There's all these signals to the air. What effect do they have on the human body? That's a good question
*  That's a good question
*  But to say that that's responsible for this coronavirus thing. It's fucking crazy. Totally if you're saying
*  They don't have any effect and here's why I go. Okay, this is why you don't need to be worried about
*  UHF or V or
*  Whatever different waves that are flying around through the air Wi-Fi and people are worried about all that kind of shit
*  They're really concerned that this does have some sort of effect on human beings
*  They think that in fact cell phone signals have an effect on bees
*  Right and that was one of the primary theories about the drop and bee populations. Yeah, colony collapse
*  Yeah, these cell phone signals are interfering with these bees ability to communicate but to say that it's the fucking coronavirus
*  Like Jesus Christ and then someone had a meme little little Duvall had a meme that he put up on his Instagram and I retweeted it
*  5g is only in five countries you fucks right this goddamn shit is spread across the whole world. Do you really think it's 5g?
*  It's they I believe YouTube has to step in and they have to do something when shit like that is so egregious
*  It's so preposterous
*  So the question is where do they draw that line if it would be nice if they could watch all your videos and say oh
*  Well, Tim Poole is a really reasonable guy. They do. Okay, but do they?
*  Really know that yeah, they do they really they really guy who's doing that?
*  Yes, who is a hundred percent dedicated to watching everything you do you put out a lot of fucking content?
*  I do I'm content you put out every day
*  So if you had a guess ran average right now as of the past few months up to about
*  Three three hours and 40 minutes per day. So you got a guy it's dedicated at YouTube. His job is what do you do?
*  I'm the Tim Poole guy. I just so first probably not like that specific, but I do have a partner manager. I
*  Do have every single video I put out on my for my my main channel is
*  Reviewed 100% of them on they just recently introduced my my other two channels
*  So I have I have a total of three channels under my name
*  Where I put out around 10 to 12 separate videos per day for a total about three hours and 40 minutes
*  They what they do. So if I upload a video it gets reviewed through something
*  So I first self-certify I say this video has no swearing it has no, you know extreme imagery or anything like that
*  If someone watches it and demonetizes it I then contact Google and they reverse it for me
*  So I actually have someone in who fixes this if there's an issue
*  They watch they watch every episode they do watch every episode every episode. That's bonkers
*  So you got a guy who that's their job?
*  I don't think I don't think it's necessarily one person
*  but I team of freaks my understanding is it is California based and
*  So so here's what I look I'm I think YouTube's a very very awesome thing I wouldn't have a show I'd be working
*  I was working for a Disney company and I did not like it and I was able to leave and start my own business
*  And I'm rather successful with it and it's because of YouTube and it's because they view me as trustworthy
*  They they you know, I've known them for a long time. They've worked with me. It's not perfect. The challenge is
*  Fundamental human rights and the and the and the collapse of the media industry when we have news outlets that
*  So I'll give you an example you posted this on Instagram that
*  people were
*  Calls for poison and you know, disinfectant ingestion had gone up after Trump's comments, right? That's not true
*  It's fake news. I fell for it too. I tweeted out. I tweeted the George George Carlin quote
*  The one that's a think about how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
*  Sure enough. It turns out they faked the story. The real story is that
*  Since the start of the pandemic people have been buying more cleaner than normal
*  so statistically with more people having cleaner they're more likely now to
*  Accidentally ingest it and since March the calls have been going up the New York Daily News
*  One of the main purveyors of the story tacked on after Donald Trump's comments
*  Unrelated unrelated unrelated dirty. So here's the problem if the Daily News if CNN if
*  Fox if MSNBC if these outlets are gonna do these things in a desperate bid to stay alive as their as their methodology fails and
*  YouTube is gonna give them preferential access which is what they've done
*  Then we're in serious trouble, but they don't give the Daily News preferential
*  No, no, but like a channel the main network do that. I don't think I'm sure that agree just right
*  Here's here's one that really grossed me out was CNN. I believe they tweeted one of the reporters at CNN tweeted that
*  Elon Musk has not supplied all the ventilators that he promised and then Elon said
*  Are you aware that Twitter has a search feature and then he starts retweeting all of these different hospitals?
*  Showing the ventilators people thanking him. It has a Tesla logo on it and and and
*  It was the hospitals requested them specifically and had they were specific parameters. So, you know what CNN did argued semantics
*  The article that was written to do to prove they were right was that those aren't ventilators
*  Real ventilators are invasive ventilators that go in your body and see pap see pap is a ventilator is a ventilator as is a bi pap
*  No, they're called non-invasive or non-intrusive. That's such a fucking gross way to justify what you tweeted and so
*  Journalists are supposed to help you understand what's going on in the yes not confuse it. They're the goal of making money
*  Right, that's what that's what it is, right?
*  It's about clickbait absolutely you can click bait that the smartest man in the world fucked up and didn't give the ventilators. Oh
*  You want to know what the scariest thing is?
*  CNN any of these network any of the any of these networks can make a fake story
*  Get a million views a day later apologize retract and they keep all the money they made they don't got to give it back
*  So they're actually actively incentivized. I'm not saying they're sitting there, you know twirling a mustache being like let's write a fake story
*  But they know that if they do they get paid and they so what you know what the fake news?
*  It's a million hits the retraction gets 30k. We get paid for both
*  so this is an editorial review fail where
*  Editors are not reviewing these articles that are being written by journalists
*  I think they're all swimming in a toilet circling, you know down to the drain because what happens is
*  Somebody so I saw a story written. I think it was an op-ed for the Washington Post or something about Trump's alligator moat
*  That's fake news that was never real
*  Alligator moat right right so the story from 2017 that Trump talked about putting alligators in a moat around the southern border or something
*  Was like it's ridiculous
*  But here's what happens you write a fake story. They wrote that yeah, so that was his idea to do that
*  It's been a while my understanding of the story was that a source familiar with you know Trump's thinking
*  Said that Trump had discussed an alligator moat, and I'm like even if Trump did isn't it obvious it was a joke
*  They take they run. They're making a lot of alligators would it take to guard the southern border thousand miles or whatever
*  But now now we see this pop up again, and so I'll tell you what man the scariest thing is how these social the social networks
*  remove
*  Like we talked about last year. They remove a certain point of view like this biotech company
*  They default on what is authoritative and the authoritative falls in one direction almost every single time
*  Falls left right yes, so you know I can't tell you how many how many stories
*  I've gone through where it's like you know that Peter Navarro story where Trump said to the journalist
*  You're a nasty nasty reporter and everything yes
*  What you don't see was the full context where the guy kept goading Trump for like 10 15 minutes
*  And then finally Trump snaps at him, and they take that one soundbite and say look at Trump just being a dick
*  It's like well yes Trump's got no filter
*  And he gets mad
*  but they cut out the entire exchange where this dude was poking and prodding and like really just
*  Insulting the guy so this guy Peter Navarro. He's saying things like why are you trying to give people hope?
*  Don't you think that offering up false hope is wrong and Trump's like no. I don't think so I think this was in chloroquine
*  Yeah, yeah
*  So you get it you get a guy that keeps you know goading him and arguing with him
*  And that's what the point was making earlier. It's these these people for CNN and whatever network have realized
*  Hey, we're gonna get ratings, but let me tell you this first of all that way of communicating is fucking terrible
*  It's second only to the terribleness that in those late night
*  New shows where they have three different people like with three the screen separated into three chunks
*  And this person on the right is arguing with this person left the moderator is trying to keep everybody in order
*  right everyone's talking over everybody and everyone's looking for a soundbite and everyone's looking to get their shots in before the buzzer because
*  Like a bell coming right the commercial runs
*  It is the dumbest way to really explore a complicated idea right and second only to that is
*  These fucking things where this the president stands at the podium and people yell things out
*  Someone called it the kung flu
*  Someone called it the kung flu do you do not denounce that this racist word kung flu and Trump said who said it yeah
*  I don't know. I heard I don't know you know I loved when
*  One of the journalists asked Trump about the price of oil he goes where's it at and the guy says oh, I don't know
*  But I know no no no where's the price of oil the reporter says I don't know then why are you asking next question?
*  Yeah, these people are don't they don't know what they're look I've sat in these rooms at press conferences
*  I have stood in front of public officials as they prepared an announcement
*  And I know exactly I've talked to these producers I've talked to the journalists. They're like ask a question
*  What should I ask just just ask anything?
*  So they've I've been thrown in front of people like ask them something
*  I'm like what am I supposed to ask them ask them anything make something up
*  Because they want you get that screen time so they can say it's theirs well
*  It's also someone like Jim Acosta for example
*  Don't you think there's an inclination when someone gets a certain amount of attention to lean towards that attention?
*  This is your base now
*  These are the people that are supporting you and you find it with like online
*  Commentators and where what's really weird is one like a person used to be left
*  and then you see they get them getting a little bit of love from the right and they start kind of like entering over there and
*  Their comments and they get more and more attention, then and then they just jump ship and the inverse like people who were
*  Leaning towards more right-wing talking points got attacked for it and then immediately came out in support of certain politicians
*  Yes, yeah, yes you see people leaning towards
*  What gets them the most amount of love right and for Jim Acosta like it seems like he gets a lot of love
*  For attacking this guy because he's talking for them for the people at home
*  I wish I could ask the president what the fuck are you doing this kind you get him Jim and then this is the
*  It's it's and it's scary when I go on reddit for instance, and they've basically purged
*  90% of any pro-trump point of view really it's gone man
*  I pull up I pull up reddit and what do I get?
*  It's it's it's all lefty commentary if you go to like r slash politics
*  Which has I think you know five to six million subs they use left-wing activist websites as new sources
*  So it's not a place for real political discussion
*  It's a place to get your your biases confirmed the same the same is true for the Donald Trump subreddit
*  Which has been basically purged, you know, they well they used to have a real subreddit called the Donald and yeah
*  They killed it they killed it because they thought that it was filled with trolls, right?
*  They killed it because they claimed the Trump supporters were threatening cops
*  I'm not joking. That's this that's the story
*  Does that sound a little strange to you that Trump supporters would be anti cop to me any sense?
*  No way that doesn't make any sense that you would use that as an example
*  for a
*  necessity
*  Necessary move to ban the entire subreddit. It seems like so it's not banned. What is it? It was quarantined quarantine
*  So you can no longer you can no longer search for it
*  The only way to access it is to be subscribed and to like give your email
*  They've since abandoned that and created a new website the Donald dot win you go there
*  You're gonna hear only good things about the president
*  And while there are certainly things you'll just like an irrational person would disagree with I think a healthy
*  Discourse tries, you know, you want to you want to see the counterpoints you want to see the positive points
*  You want to better understand, you know
*  Is there a real reason why Donald Trump did something or is he just an idiot?
*  And if you're only getting one side of it Europe Europe Europe Europe your view of the world is just
*  Totally it used to be like the Wild West right used it was pretty wild until like 2016 is very little moderating
*  Reddit is so incredibly easy to manipulate and control at ridiculously easy that
*  You know, I remember and what year was maybe 2015 political operatives were seeking ways to prop up politicians
*  Manipulating read its algorithms because users have direct control of it. I
*  Just tell you it's ridiculously easy to do like insanely easy
*  They've since made it more difficult
*  But one person with a hand with it with ten cell phones and you could own the front page of reddit very very easily
*  That's crazy since then we've seen
*  Accusations of and I think it's fair to say, you know in my experience
*  I know that this you know tends to exist the sock puppetry when someone runs multiple accounts pretending to be different people to create the perception
*  Consensus yes, and that's what they do. That's really really common super
*  I know a guy who is a moderator at reddit and told me this one account had nine different people
*  Or a nine what one person had nine different accounts
*  They were using to attack this guy and you can can so the way right it works
*  I don't know is you up vote and down vote something if it has more up votes
*  It moves up if it has more down votes. It does it slowly disappears
*  So if you create a bunch of different accounts using proxy servers or you know other IP manipulation
*  You can make sure your post is always in front now
*  Was there a concern that the Donald's that the Donald reddit site was being manipulated that someone that they were basically just using it
*  Early on yeah. Yeah, there was a so the Donald post would frequently hit the front page of all
*  So if you go to reddit and you want to see every subreddit the Donald is always on top
*  So it was so active it depends on who you ask right or because people were manipulating it one or the other I
*  It's there's a good argument for both. I don't have the evidence to give you a definitive answer
*  I think it's fair to say that Trump supporters will smash the upvote button make sure those posts always fly to the top because they're
*  Very enthusiastic very enthusiastic. It's also possible that somebody had a bot, you know botnet that was you know
*  Yeah, yeah, but one of the things that the Donald got in trouble for I think was they would they would do what's called a sticky
*  Post so that means if you went there one post was always on top of their page
*  So the supporters knew to upvote it guaranteeing it would get a lot of traction. Oh
*  But we actually saw this is the craziest thing the CEO of reddit
*  Manipulated in the database someone's comment who was a Trump supporter. It's actually this is like could you imagine the CEO did this?
*  They edited it. He went into the database the hard database for someone's comment and changed what they said what yeah
*  He apologized for it saying I got new I got angry
*  Someone called him a pedo. So he was like, oh, yeah, and he went in. Oh
*  That's right. I remember this
*  He actually edited the words to make that person look like a piece of shit like anti Trump or something. Yes
*  So I'll tell you what man
*  Look, there's there's a lot of arguments you can make about policy and the right way to solve these problems
*  But I go on the front I go I open reddit and I'm browsing through it and I see these comments from people that clearly
*  Do not understand what's going out these protests of people want the economy to reopen and I try and talk to my friends about it
*  and it seems like they're trapped because I
*  Think you know, it's like you were mentioning how people drift towards what gets them the most love
*  But now it's not just famous people. It's not just people on social media
*  It's everybody who does that and they don't want that worldview broken
*  Well, they also don't want to lose the respect of their friends who are also subscribing to that same ideology
*  Yeah, yeah, that's a big part of it man politics over here in California
*  if you're if you're not left-wing if you don't you know, just
*  Instantaneously when when there's an issue
*  Instantaneously side with the left you get chastised and you get called a racist or you call the Nazi or you call the
*  Trump supporter. Yeah, you can't even have a rational perspective on things
*  You can't say something like in hindsight it was a good idea that Donald Trump closed off
*  Travel from China because it was coming from there and a lot of people were calling him racist
*  It turned out to be a good move and then they've shut it down from a lot of different places as well
*  You can't say that so so yeah, right
*  so the first thing Trump does is
*  The task force two days later the travel ban Joe Biden says the last thing we need is Trump's xenophobia
*  Then on March I think 12th Trump suspends travel from Europe Joe Biden says a travel ban won't stop this
*  April 3rd Biden says actually Trump was right about that now Joe Biden's launching ads saying Trump didn't go far enough now
*  Nancy Pelosi is saying Trump should have banned Americans from coming back in
*  Did you ever see that video where Nancy Pelosi is talking about telling people to go to Chinatown?
*  Oh, yeah, of course that video is fucking insane and when they confront her on it on Fox News
*  I think was Chris Wallace on Fox News was talking to her about it
*  She's saying well the record will show that I was saying don't be rude to Chinese people now you were down there encouraging it
*  Yes, and the record will show she's such an ineffective speaker
*  It's so bizarre that she got to a position of power because she's right
*  She's so disingenuous and so fake in the way she communicates especially on those shows. Maybe she's just old
*  Maybe she was better before I don't know maybe right that's the question this oh man
*  Yeah, the Biden question that dude's not even he's not even here anymore. He is so weird
*  It's so weird that they're pretending that it's okay that this is gonna be fine
*  But the way they're defending him over these allegations is this the creepiest thing I'm worrying the allegations
*  You see you see you see Alyssa Milano when she has what what is this? Yeah, she said he deserves due process
*  Yeah, please other times. What about all the other people? This is it's it's you know, I
*  Can't predict what's gonna happen. There's a lot of things that are changing, you know right now
*  That's gonna affect whether or not Trump wins the Republicans win or lose
*  But what about is this weird thing that he wants to do where he wants to insist on a woman of color as a vice
*  Presidential nom not not Biden wants to I think he said I'm not sure if he said woman of color
*  I think he said he's he's guaranteeing it's gonna be a woman and he's looking at a woman of color
*  I'm not entirely sure to me. That's
*  That's absurd. I mean absurd if you've if you've got a good candidate
*  I think you know, I don't care what they look like what their skin color is their race gender
*  I know a lot of people on the left view that as like short-sighted
*  Because and and I think there's there's decent reasons to talk about how identity plays
*  You know into how you view the world and the policies you want to implement. I just think it's dangerous to create that kind of
*  Yeah, we're not talking about prom queen. We're talking about someone who actually has a real important job
*  I shouldn't pick them based on what part of the world their ancestors are from or what gender they are
*  I would actually say on a scale of one to a hundred that's not near like the top 50
*  But I think it is fair to say that there's a real reason why that would play a factor play a role
*  like you you've got a lot of people who have never experienced certain things and that includes the left and
*  one of the big problems in politics is
*  What we see coming from the left is really based on urban living and from conservatives on more likely to be rural living
*  So when you see people on the left argue for like rent strikes and things like that
*  Well, yeah, you're in it. You're in cities where you're predominantly renters. So that's your big issue
*  It doesn't resonate the same with people who live in areas where they primarily own their homes
*  Or if you're talking about the Second Amendment like obviously people in cities they tend to be liberal. They want gun control
*  Yeah, because you've got a very very dense
*  Population gun accidents probably are an issue and you've got cops within a minute's notice you live in a rural area
*  The cops are 40 minutes away. You need to protect yourself
*  So this this divide creates a difficulty in creating policy for the entirety of the country. I
*  Good point. I personally would never
*  Play someone's like racial identity or gender in the top priorities
*  But I do think it's it is fair to point out that you know
*  A black woman is gonna understand things about life in the black community that a white man's not going to
*  That doesn't mean you give them a job because of it. You can point out the perspectives will be different
*  I agree with both those things. Right, right. That's a good point too in terms of
*  The overall country is so enormous and it's so different and varied like to find some common ground
*  Amongst everyone is so incredibly difficult. So it's a contest of who's got the bigger bigger bucket
*  Yeah, bigger electoral bucket. Yeah, that's a good way of putting it too. Yeah. Yeah, it seems like
*  But either way, there's so many people that are just gonna vote left to get Trump out of office
*  They don't care. You're gonna elect a guy with dementia. You got to pull up this article stay alive Joe Biden
*  by the Atlantic
*  No, I'm not kidding. When did they put this in? Oh man was a couple weeks ago. Maybe it's called stay alive
*  Joe Biden all something and then she says something like all we need is your corporeal form and it's
*  It's not not only
*  Arguing that we just need Joe Biden's body
*  But it actually kind of argues is a bad candidate and it's like it doesn't matter though
*  It doesn't because we just don't like Trump. Well, they're right about that. He's a bad candidate
*  Biden yeah, they could have done so much better with the booted judge with Klobuchar with
*  They're terrified. So gabbert and they're terrified of Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang
*  I think probably freaks him out a little bit too. I was uh
*  I'm a big fan of Tulsi and
*  Followed by Yang and a lot of people didn't like that because you know, I rag on Democrats all the time
*  It's like more I'll fully admit you can criticize me all day and night
*  I'm I very you know much see Pelosi and Schiff Nadler and like, you know the problems we have with them
*  And I'm not a fan of their policies. I think they go, you know, they either do nothing
*  But you know within that I saw Andrew Yang and his website the list of things he's gone through for what he's thought about was
*  Was insane. I mean the dude had a policy for everything. Well, he's a brilliant guy
*  Absolutely, and he's also not a politician
*  So his approach is going to be from a guy who's an entrepreneur
*  Right a guy who looks at it in terms of problems to fix you could you can argue there's a similar thing there with Trump
*  Being a businessman but Yang's list of his he's a comprehensive list of policy positions was it was to me
*  I was like I like it. I do
*  Tulsi not that guy the thing about Trump is a giant personality, right? Whereas Yang is a really reasonable person. Yeah
*  For me, you know Tulsi's anti-war stance was paramount. I think the US has wasted too much money
*  We've got people arguing for you know, fix the pipes in Flint and I'm like right on let's stop building weapons and doing deployments
*  and trying to control these foreign countries and start working within America and I think that there's a reason why a lot of
*  Moderates and conservatives like Tulsi and it's that it's it's kind of America first, right? Yeah
*  And why are we applying so much of our resources and time and energy to these foreign countries? We shouldn't be doing that
*  Well, also she's earned that perspective with two tours of duty overseas
*  She served in you know, the armed forces she's been a congresswoman for six years
*  She understands a lot about how this works. I disagree. I disagree with her on some of her domestic policy issues nuclear energy and
*  Well, what is her stance on nuclear she opposes it well
*  I don't want to speak for her because I'm trying to be very careful but negative view on nuclear energy
*  And nuclear energy is different than Three Mile Island, you know or Fukushima. We need to understand that
*  When you're looking at some of these issues that they have with Fukushima in particular
*  Which is a kind of an antiquated system that they had set up that they can't really shut off
*  Which I had a whole bit about how crazy that is
*  Yeah, what when you're talking about the nuclear power that they could implement today
*  It would be a very different system, right? That would be fairly clean
*  Extremely high return on energy investment. Yeah and zero emissions. Yes, but there's a fear because of the past
*  Let's put it somewhere that sucks
*  It's put somewhere that sucks put a big one somewhere that sucks and juice up the whole country with it
*  You know when it when it when it came to Yang, I felt like here
*  We had a guy who I'm not a big fan of UBI and but it's a weird one, right?
*  They I think the way he put it spoke more to me than the way anyone else ever framed it and I actually
*  Felt like he shouldn't have called it universal basic income. Hmm. Well, didn't he call it the freedom dividend, right?
*  Yeah, but it became you be I to so many people that's right. I went with it
*  Yeah, when you see, you know Amazon Google these big companies becoming just insane
*  Behemoths that can't you know, they can't be broken up
*  They just absorb and absorb and absorb
*  Then there's an argument for some kind of dividend to the American people for potentially what they do outside of the United States. It's it's
*  Very complicated up and economics. I guess I'm not smart enough to you know, pretend like I know anything about
*  But you look at he brought the example of Alaska
*  They have the oil drilling the people who live in Alaska get a portion of that revenue and those profits
*  That makes sense
*  UBI the way it's framed in general makes very little sense and eventually I think we're actually seeing now with the government stimulus
*  One of the biggest pitfalls to it. Do you hear there's a there was a story
*  They ran an NBC a woman her employees were like in revolt
*  Because she acquired a loan from the paycheck protection program that insured their jobs meaning they would receive less money
*  Because under the cares act they would have received a bonus of six hundred dollars per week on top of the salary
*  They'd normally get they actually preferred to have lost their jobs
*  So you have people who are complaining that they're keeping their jobs now, so there's that's one instance though
*  There's a there's a couple stories like that
*  but the challenge with
*  Just giving people cash cash is the assumption that the cash has inherent value when the value of it is based upon what you can
*  Get for it. So one of the lessons I think we learn now with the economy being shut down is
*  Doctors and nurses got to work, you know that we need them on the front line. They're also getting paid
*  What do they use that money for pay their rent buy food things like that?
*  We're having we're facing food shortages if you can't buy anything with the money. What's the point to take in the money? I
*  Mean like if you were given a choice
*  You're gonna work you're gonna go work your job at a grocery store. You're an essential worker
*  We're gonna pay you 400 bucks your buddy
*  Who isn't let me stop you right there because the universal basic income was not designed to deal with the pandemic
*  Automation which would have not stopped the supply chain, which is not stopped which wouldn't have created food shortages
*  This is a sort of a unique situation. So you're comparing apples oranges
*  You're applying universal basic income to our current situation
*  Which has nothing to do with the reason why he wanted to implement it in the first place
*  He's worried that automation is gonna take away jobs. He's right. It will it probably will now consider this problem though
*  There will always be some kind of essential work, right?
*  Yes, what do you tell the essential worker when other people are working?
*  What do you tell the essential worker when other people are getting money and don't work that you have no choice because you're essential
*  Even in an automation system. So let's say every job but groceries, but hold on a second
*  They're only getting a small amount of money to stay alive
*  You would rather have a good job where you getting paid well and have benefits and all that other stuff
*  I think that's an assumption. It is an assumption
*  But the thing is universal basic income the real problem is a psychology issue
*  The real problem is the way human beings work. We need incentives
*  Yeah, people don't just want to survive and get a little check from the government will be people be despondent
*  You know, you you don't want to create any United States of welfare like an
*  all-encompassing thing where
*  some you know these
*  Programs that are in place that automate all of the goods and services
*  They take some of that money and give it back to the people because no one can work like that's a that's a depressing
*  Dystopian future. I mean that's a terrible place to live. You ever watch Battlestar Galactica. Yes loved it
*  You ever see snowpiercer was that then you talking about a new Battlestar Galactica?
*  Yeah, the new one what was snow piercer? Which one was that?
*  That's where Chris Evans is on a train that travels around the world because the world is frozen and only that train has like it's a kind
*  Of a weird premise, but there's an episode of no no no no, it's a movie
*  Oh, I'm just bringing up two different bits of fiction to you know, make a point. Oh, yeah, it's a futuristic movie
*  It's real weird. Who else is in it Chris?
*  Isn't it? Yeah, I think I did see that it's real weird. Yeah, it's kind of cool
*  So they take kids from the back from the poor cart and have them work internally in the engine
*  Because they have to move things around because parts are missing if they don't everyone all human life dies
*  So they literally go in the back and they take children away from their families who scream and reject this in Battlestar
*  They had children who were also taken for a similar reason to work
*  You had people who had no choice but to work on the fuel processing ship. Otherwise all of humanity we wiped out
*  One of I've often thought about you know, I'm a huge fan of Star Trek the next generation
*  How do we get to a post capitalism world where we still have incentives, but we're post, you know post scarcity
*  The problem is in it as we're in transition. There will be jobs that are essential
*  Which means one of the one of the glimpses we get I understand a pandemic is different
*  But we still see a glimpse of people who have to work
*  You know kind of low-skilled boring tedious jobs like at a grocery store
*  While other people who have higher skilled jobs are getting their their needs met by the government at least in terms of the cash
*  So we're we're here telling you know, these people talking about right now, right? Right. So again, I understand it's a pandemic
*  It's very specific
*  But we're getting a glimpse of what happens when some people are told your job is not essential
*  So we're gonna guarantee your food and resources for the time being you are barely doing that though
*  It's not as effective. I'm just I'm just saying that as we move towards automation, there will still be jobs that are essential
*  What do we do?
*  How do we you know?
*  Incentivize and compensate make that worth the people who have no choice but to keep working while the rest of us don't I don't know
*  If it's a keep working why the rest of us don't issue. I think it's a problem of jobs being phased out
*  I think the real problem is automation is gonna phase out jobs. It's not gonna be about what's essential. What's not essential
*  I think you're sort of applying pandemic
*  Vernacular to let's let's let's remove the pandemic from it and let's say, you know right now
*  One of the things I looked at and we talked about this a little bit before I met a homeless guy in Chicago
*  And he worked at a job that became obsolete. I I'll set back a little bit
*  Yes, I asked a homeless guy how he became homeless when I was like 19 and he told me that
*  He had a job
*  He worked there for 20 30 years as he got older his family, you know moved away lost contact
*  These are different times some friends and family had died when his company became obsolete
*  Technology didn't matter anymore. He was cast out, you know, he had nowhere to work anymore and his expertise was very specific
*  So he got a severance package that ran out. He got unemployment that ran out. He got kicked out now
*  He's homeless. I look at that and I say how do we make sure that doesn't happen?
*  This guy should not be punished simply because times have changed
*  But if you scale that up, you know and say it keeps happening in every different sector
*  Eventually, you'll end up with 90% of the population
*  Saying my needs will be taken care of and 10% saying I still have to work whatever the industry may be
*  Like that's that's a transitional period. It's gonna be very difficult. We automate most jobs except for some
*  Some people will still have to work. Does anybody really think you're gonna automate most jobs though?
*  I mean, there's so many jobs that can't be motivated automated
*  I don't think that's gonna be the I mean where you're talking about some weird sort of futuristic version. Yeah
*  I don't think that's what we need to be concerned with
*  I think I think the idea of universal basic income is wonderful the idea that your your needs are taken care of in terms
*  Of food and housing and then everything else you got to do on your own
*  If we're looking at when we look at struggle, right we look at struggle like across the board
*  Can't feed yourself can't put a roof over your head can't that would have the this is what was attractive
*  But universal basic income to me. What if we all agreed that some
*  semblance of
*  Dignity is a part of being an American and then we will provide you with food
*  we will provide you with housing everything else you have to fucking earn and
*  That's interesting. I that's interesting. I like that. I like it, but I don't know
*  Is it people don't work well when they don't have to exactly when people don't have an incentive and the
*  Competition is important and when you look at people that are anti-capitalist
*  And they're really into socialism one of things you find is a lot of rich kids
*  So that's it's weird, right? It's fucking very real weird
*  It's because they don't understand real struggle because they've grown up without it and they have these ideals like they feel guilty because they've grown
*  Up without struggle and they want to help the world and they think capitalism is evil and I never saw my dad
*  So we need to we need to get all these rich people need to give that money to all these poor people
*  We get balance out income. You know what else they notice the people around them were all white
*  If people that are into socialism the the people that are into socialism tend to be upper-class upper middle-class white generalizing in a big way
*  Right, right, right a lot of but there there's there's some studies some research that came out and it finds the overwhelming majority of
*  Socialists in the United States. Yeah, you know they came from
*  Upper middle class to upper class families that tended to be white
*  Yeah
*  And those are the ones that focus so hard on these social justice warrior issues you you take a person who's been surrounded by rich white
*  People yes, it probably got a reason to not like them
*  But then they assume all white people are the same and you end up seeing this
*  racialization of politics also they find themselves in a position of
*  Affluence that they didn't earn they want to burn it all to the ground. Yep
*  You know, it's and they assume you know, I think there's some
*  Truth in that you know that there's people who have money they didn't earn and there are leeches on the system
*  They make money from money. They've never done anything in their lives. Sure. They're arrogant. Sure
*  There's a lot of people like that, right?
*  But you know when you don't take that generalization and apply it to anyone who has money or everyone and you take it to a dark
*  Place exactly when I when I first started, you know entering the public space in terms of news and politics
*  I was at Occupy Wall Street and
*  before I had any notoriety I was being
*  Heralded they called me a good example of what's wrong with the system
*  Here's Tim pool a high school dropout mixed-race guy and here he is just sleeping in a dirt park using his phone to tell
*  The real stories of the world after I got featured in Time magazine
*  What did they say Tim pool is white and he was born with a silver spoon, which is not true
*  It's absolutely not true
*  But the the the socialist types the activists couldn't accept that I had you know jumped the the class system
*  I guess their view of the world is rigid that the rich people keep the poor down
*  There's no chance for upward mobility and that's not the case
*  You know, you absolutely can become successful from you know humble me one of my favorite AOC quotes was her talking about it's literally
*  Impossible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when she used to be a waitress
*  I know she's a congresswoman like you can't look it's not impossible, but it's not even that's what we need to address
*  It's not even the reality is some people have a far easier path
*  Absolutely, and some people have a far more difficult path
*  It's just dizzy. This is just but you have to deal with the hand you're given if life is a game
*  And why I'm not saying it's a game it is life
*  But it's similar to a game in that you're dealt a set of cards. You're dealt a set of circumstances and
*  Yes, some people just get four aces from birth your dad's a multi
*  billionaire and your whole family's always been rich and you never have to worry about a goddamn thing for the rest of your life
*  Well, guess what those people turn out to be fucking miserable and crazy
*  There's some benefit in being born with a shitty hand of cards. Absolutely there really is a motivational benefit for sure
*  Gumption yeah, you know there's a TED talk
*  There's one one trait one personality trait that guarantees success of all of all it's not intelligence
*  It's not class not race not gender unit is what perseverance. That's it. I believe that as a TED talk on it
*  it's it's interesting and
*  It's true now
*  I think there's there's always going to be certain limits based on your ability like I'm never gonna play in the NBA right tall enough
*  Right nowhere near as fast or can jump high enough. Actually, that's not tracking jump pretty high skateboard, but
*  you take people
*  who
*  Don't have top-tier intelligence
*  Not the strongest but if they work hard enough, they can find their their apex
*  They can find that point where they are successful and they can make it right. It's not true for everybody
*  Some people are below that that threshold no matter how hard they try they're gonna need help
*  Well, I think that the problem is with any sort of generalization, you know perseverance is the most important thing
*  Yes, sure, but you also have to be intelligent. You can't be doing the same thing over and over again
*  No, I'm not gonna quit because no you have to be able to figure out what you're doing wrong as well as have perseverance
*  Perseverance is a necessary part of the equation, but there's many pieces to that question
*  Define success in that regard right if success is well depends on the field that you're choosing right if you're not smart enough to be an
*  Astrophysicist you shouldn't be an astrophysicist, right? You're not tall enough to play in the NBA
*  You probably can't play in do you think that's not necessarily true though Muggsy bows that dude was amazing
*  He was amazing. Yes, five seven was he yeah, 360 dump. Yeah, amazing. Was he five five five three?
*  Three spud web. That's right. Wow, you're shorter than I thought. Yeah, but you can do it. Yeah, that's amazing
*  It's very rare right we talked about two guys, right?
*  Yeah, I think the average person has the potential and the capabilities of being
*  successful wealthy
*  If they want famous, I think one of the one of the challenges we have in our culture is how we're raising kids and what?
*  We're what the values we're giving them. Well, it's also what are you trying to do? Like what do you look? There's a thing
*  There's a bunch of different things that you could just you just don't have like some people can't sing
*  They don't have any fucking talent. They just don't have it. Their voice sounds like shit
*  But guess who else's voice sound like shit Bob Dylan
*  Terrible voice. Yeah, how does it feel?
*  Man people love it because there's like authenticity and passion and there's something to it, right?
*  But he found out a way to make it work. He wouldn't win American Idol fuck
*  No, imagine music one of the greatest musicians ever. Yeah, I'm going like
*  Someone saying what do you want to do man? I want to be a singer songwriter. Okay, just without any music
*  What any interest me sing me a song?
*  Probably probably well, you know
*  There's there there are a lot of people especially in the internet day and age that you would not expect to have made it who made it
*  Yes, you know, that's well, you know, there's a lot. Yeah, I mean this and then there's rules today that I don't think really hold
*  True, you know people say oh, you know, you have to be good-looking. You have to be thin
*  Adele's not thin she is now she's thin now people are mad at her for being thin. Yeah
*  She just was talented. She said a powerful voice or that woman Susan. What was her name that was on?
*  America's Got Talent. No, I don't know. No, it wasn't America's Got Talent X Factor X Factor
*  I was in Boyle that look fucking wizard over here Susan Boyle
*  She looked like someone's Grammy, right?
*  And but she belted out this song that made Simon Cowell almost cry Wow, but she was just fucking talented
*  Just really good you you can find a thing
*  But you know if you're Susan Boyle and you want to be a comedian, maybe her jokes are fucking terrible
*  Maybe she would show up at open mic night
*  It's a Sunday night at the Comedy Store over and over again and keep bombing and then you know, she never would have made it
*  Yeah, I can't learn some people said I think I think if you can if you can learn right if you can you know
*  What one of the problems those people refuse to accept when they're wrong, they rise up to be self-critical
*  Yeah, they're not
*  They don't have an analytical perspective in terms of their own issues
*  They can't analyze themselves and see the flaws and be objective and introspective
*  Some people just don't have that because they've been protecting themselves
*  They have these sort of personality traits that protect themselves from self deprecation from
*  Understanding where they're flawed when I was a teenager
*  I remember reading that Michael Jordan would watch tapes of himself playing to figure out what he did wrong
*  I don't know if that's true. But to me that was like
*  If you want to be the best like yes, you need to actively look for what you're screwing up. Yeah call out immediately
*  Well, that's imperative for sparring. Yeah when you're sparring like we used to film a lot of back when I was competing
*  We would film sparring sessions and fights particular fights
*  But sparring sessions it was critical because you could see how you were telegraphing something and then you got countered
*  You could see how and sometimes you don't think you're doing it
*  Then you realize like oh my god, I'm dropping my hand every time I do this and then you get caught crazy
*  Yeah, it's like that's with everything though like poker. Yeah. Yeah giving your tells away. Mm-hmm
*  That's nuts, but I think most things
*  You'd be better off seeing like with comedy. It's massive. It's gigantic being able to
*  Visually see yourself is like primary. That's number one
*  Little bit a little bit less good is listening to yourself and at a certain point in time in your career
*  You can get away with just listening in terms of like but there's a big difference between people who?
*  Monitor their stuff and go over it and analyze it versus people who don't and it's just it's it's accelerated learning
*  It's like taking advantage of all the tools that you're given and you can apply that
*  To anything that you're trying to do good in life if you have the time and the energy
*  If you're doing a job and during this job, you know
*  You just show up at work and you try to do your best then you go home you fuck off and you do your stuff
*  You'll get better at whatever you do exactly
*  But if you go and do your job and then afterwards analyze what you did
*  Pay attention to it write things down make a diary perhaps or review your work and really you'll get better faster
*  It's a matter of how much time as long as you don't burn out. I don't take days off ever. Yeah, that's weird
*  I took a day off yesterday had some bad sushi. I
*  Here's a lesson everybody if if I don't want to be mean to the sushi people
*  They're really nice to me
*  But you know maybe maybe lay off sushi if they've been closed for a month because of pandemic and well you're driving
*  From the other side of the country text me. I'll tell you the places
*  There's only I go to like four places out here for sushi and everywhere else. I'm like, ooh
*  Yeah, no. Well, so here's what I wanted to say, right?
*  I don't take a day off and a lot of people say I'm crazy and I've actually in my Monday through Friday is now double
*  Shifts every day then Saturday and Sunday are single shifts in terms of production
*  so I do Monday through Friday three hours and 40 minutes about Saturday and Sunday is about an hour and 40 minutes and
*  And what would I do if I wasn't working? I'd be playing video games, but listen to the numbers you just said
*  Yeah, three hours and 40 Monday through Friday. Yeah, and then an hour and a half per weekend day
*  Yeah, that's still not a full day's work. That's not a full week's work
*  So average person an hour and a half of recording is like 10 hours of research. Oh, okay. Yeah
*  Well, so working more so it's like eight hours
*  So I'm doing constant research in between fact-checking and then I record like once I get everything in line and I think I'm confident
*  I'm what I'm what you know what I have and of course I'm aren't I'm not perfect
*  Then I record for about 20 minutes then I get back to researching reading and I you know
*  So it's it's there's another benefit though. You work for yourself. Absolutely
*  You don't have some dickhead over your shoulder telling you what do I chose this though, right?
*  So so there's a couple things when you brought up you get good at whatever you
*  Whatever is you do I tell my friends every second you spend doing something as an investment to be into being better than better at that
*  So if you want to come home from work and play video games all day, you'll be really good at video games, man
*  Maybe start a stream you twitch channel
*  Maybe you maybe you can make you know some money being a good personality
*  But you got to earn it or maybe there's something you want to do that instead of playing video games you do that instead
*  For me when I'm not working. I'm just sitting around like why am I not working? What am I doing?
*  You know, I'm it's I ended up taking yesterday off
*  I didn't work today because we're doing the show and so I'm sitting, you know sitting around watching TV shows
*  Like this is awful. I can't stand I gotta read the news man. I gotta I gotta be I gotta be into it
*  Well, you're driven
*  You know that but also you're enjoying it
*  That's the difference between someone who's working in a fucking coal mine or someone who's working in a field all day picking strawberries
*  Yeah, but I hate the job. Yeah, I hear you but you know, you know many people have hit me up
*  You probably get something similar like how do I do what you do, you know
*  When I was working for vice and I was traveling around the world
*  1020 emails every week from young people saying I really want to do what you do
*  And you know what I you know what they would say to me when I would tell them how to do it
*  They would say I will never do that. I
*  Would tell them here's what you do
*  Do you have any money saved up? No, okay. Where do you work?
*  You don't work get a job Starbucks McDonald's whatever you can get maybe you can do better than that save your money
*  Once you've saved enough
*  Find a store you want fly there cover it you know what they would say
*  No, I had one. I there's one person who said to me. I want to travel around the world and do what you do
*  How do I do it? I say do you have money saved up? Yes excellent
*  There's a story right now going on in Turkey. All right, you got to be secure. You got to be safe, but it's in bowls fairly
*  Okay, fly there right now film it and you know
*  I'll see if I can make any connections on what you find
*  You know, they said well the money I saved is for my apartment in Brooklyn and I'm like, right
*  What's more important to you having your nice Williamsburg apartment or being a journalist traveling around the world? Well, I like my apartment
*  I'm like, okay listen
*  When I worked for vice I was sleeping on a couch
*  Every time they paid me I put in the bank. I didn't touch it
*  I got a job working for a Disney an ABC News joint venture company after that
*  They paid me a bunch of money. I put 70% in the bank. I didn't touch it when I left
*  I went to a bunch of these New York digital companies
*  You know, I'll spare them their names for any embarrassment many of them who have become rather worthless
*  This will exist and they're big and I decided after seeing what they had to offer the bias the deception
*  The the clickbait driven nature of it
*  I'm do myself and because I saved my money I was up of the way I was able to do so
*  So then I had an apartment then I could pay for my plane ticket
*  You know to to Sweden to France to Germany to do these stories and started building up a base
*  Within about seven or eight months. I had gone from red to black. So now all of a sudden I was no longer losing money
*  I was making money and I'm like there it is a couple of years on ridiculous ridiculous is ridiculously successful
*  For myself, I guess I could you know, it's relative but I've got some several employees launching new companies
*  Well, one of the companies shattered a fundraising record of a million bucks in a single day
*  So that's that that's look the path for me isn't the path for everybody but sacrifice, you know
*  Well, you're basically saying exactly what they're saying in TED talk perseverance
*  And you you embrace the grind but it's also what do you really prioritize? Yeah for me, what are you trying to do?
*  I don't care about having an apartment. I want to I want to I want to see what was going on the ground in Istanbul
*  So, you know, it's also like who who is the type of person that would chase down the stories?
*  The type of person that's really gonna chase down the stories is a person is driven to chase down stories
*  What you're getting is questions from idiots you're getting questions from people that like how do I do it?
*  And then when you offer the answer I'm not gonna do that right those are the people that are never gonna make it
*  Like there's a conversation I had with Ari Shafir where he and Robert Kelly
*  Apparently they they thought about sponsoring a comic who's up and coming taking care of their financial needs and you know for like a year
*  And a lot trying to see how far they could get in their career if they didn't have to deal with money
*  And I said that's the problem is the type of person who's going to make it is going to make it not just
*  In spite of the fact that they don't have any money, but because of the fact they don't have any money
*  Those day jobs those sucky jobs that you need to have when you're struggling those these they fucking motivate you
*  They're important if somebody just comes along gives you all the money you need for food
*  You're gonna half-ass it and some hungry guy on the other side of town is gonna take all the gigs that you would get
*  They're gonna write better jokes. They're gonna be more motivated to go to open mics. They're gonna pound the pavement harder
*  Well, I got a story for you. I'll try to get the details right to my buddy's company
*  So forgive me if I'm if I'm getting the details wrong, but he had a social media management company
*  He started himself. He knew everything about social media Instagram and all that and he started building up a client base where I'm gonna run
*  Your social media for you
*  Worked like a charm start making ton of money get new contracts these companies know what they were doing
*  He got to a point where I had to hire people
*  He ended up hiring a couple college grads and he put up the ad saying, you know college degree required
*  They couldn't figure anything out they kept calling him having problems couldn't manage anything. So he fires him
*  Rehires again more college grads same problem
*  Eventually has to fire him then he hires because he's running out of money
*  He hires to high school
*  I think they were high school dropouts and he was like they wanted substantially less money and at this point
*  I just couldn't find good people they worked swimmingly. It was amazing. No phone calls. No problems
*  These were people who had worked hard saved up money in their small bumpkin hometown
*  Moved to Los Angeles to make it big they knew what they wanted
*  They knew what they had to do and they said I will find a way to do it
*  He said the other people are hiring were just like drones. They just wanted a job
*  They didn't know or care what they were doing
*  They didn't bother so they don't want to learn but these people who are driven viewed this as
*  Just another problem to be solved on my path to success
*  Yeah, that's that's the mindset and that's the difference the mindset of success is the mindset of I will figure it out
*  So I think the problem is how we're raising people in this country we're raising them to in certain areas
*  To expect things to be given to you. You get a participation trophy. No matter what you do your congratulations
*  This is the problem with socialism and this is the problem with universal basic income what we're talking about. Yeah. Yeah
*  Expecting something from the government particularly without any financial feasibility
*  There's no there's no real logic to where that money comes from like show me your work is right, right? What is money?
*  You know, so so one of the arguments I keep seeing from a lot of people who have more I don't want to call them
*  Socialists, I think they're just regular urban dwelling like liberal left-tie people. Mm-hmm
*  There's one viral post on on reddit on reddit
*  It said you've got these conservatives or you've got these people out protesting so they can enrich their landlords and these billionaires
*  When they should be demanding that rent be waived that mortgages
*  you know in evictions be canceled and at the government take care of their needs and provide them with stimulus or something like that and
*  And I look at that like you're very clearly living in a city
*  But what they don't understand is they say things like, you know landlord isn't a job
*  Like I argue that there's a lot of very successful landlords who make a ton of money and do very little but it's a fucking job
*  Right. It's so stupid to say it's not a job. It's not just that
*  It's the money you pay in rent can't just be wiped out because there's groundskeepers. There's maintenance. There's
*  Administrative assistance there's taxes that be filed rent doesn't just go into their pocket so they can buy a boat
*  But they view it this way and they think that money is is what you want that
*  What when they say these people who want the government to be reopened, you know are simply trying to enrich the wealthy
*  It's like I think maybe they make things and they want to keep making things they want
*  They want their economy not the government the economy. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you know mixing that up
*  but there's there there there are a lot of people that don't seem to understand I
*  think it's because
*  When you live in a city everything's already there for you when I lived in New York the Williamsburg Bridge boom
*  There it is. I didn't see it built. I didn't pay a dime for it and I can just use it
*  I can cross over it's just there and I've never had to you know, you never had to fight for it
*  So you just say why can't I just have it you see you walk in any store and there's food
*  Hey, there's food easy
*  What they don't see is the supply chain where the food is made the work that goes into it
*  So they assume that money
*  guarantees access to it
*  Which it doesn't if the economy is shut down
*  The money can't buy you things the value of that money starts going down if the farms can't sell any of this to anybody and start
*  Dumping and I think it's called fallowing fields no longer farming then there's nothing to buy
*  So if products aren't being made and services aren't being rendered because the economy is closed
*  What is your money gonna get you at a certain point when the economy is shut down for too long?
*  And we're seeing all of these businesses close family businesses. I heard a story terrible tragedy
*  Somebody killed themselves because there's their family business of 70 years was shut down
*  That that product is gone
*  So eventually there's no food to buy and only then will people realize the government stimulus money has no inherent value
*  It's it's the work we do for each other
*  That's the argument being left out when you when you get a biased view on social media or when these people don't quite understand
*  You know, that's the problem
*  There's a lot of noise people that don't quite understand people that aren't a part of the supply chain that really don't know what it's like
*  To like the people that raise food they're freaking out right now
*  Yeah
*  People that raise cattle and the people that grow food and the fact that they have to deal with being shut down and
*  Trying to figure out how to restart things and when is it gonna be okay to restart things?
*  When is it okay? And what if it happens again with there's another flare-up two months from now?
*  I mean they're hurting right now and they might might take years to recover from these past couple months
*  Well, there was I think some
*  Health official in California saying they might not not be able to fully reopen until there's a vaccine which could take 18 months
*  Fully reopen what like to go back to normal right? So I think there was an MIT technology review article
*  Talking about how we may have to do intermittent lockdowns, you know, like two months locked down one month off
*  Until the vaccine is available. Then there was another another study came out saying something similar about herd immunity
*  I mean Sweden they think they're they're on target for the end of May to have herd immunity, which is like 60%
*  I think yeah, I the information keeps changing
*  You know, we're learning more. So maybe these statements are at this point. I don't know obsolete
*  Yeah, Sweden's a weird place too because it's a it's consists mostly of little villages
*  Why Sweden? Yes, I mean they're big cities. Well, you have Stockholm, but
*  primarily the population is sort of
*  It's
*  It's separated by these smaller towns. It's not you're right over there
*  Is you already been tested for the co vid
*  Really worried about you right now. People are weird about coughs now. You know, totally I inhaled water. Yeah
*  Coughs are nerve-racking for folks. Oh, that's brutal
*  Right. Yeah, you gave me this bottle of water and I held it
*  Just mess me up. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. You know, give me it. Yeah relax
*  No, it's okay I got to Joe gave me the test
*  Do we know no co vid 19? Yeah, you're your voice sounds terrible right now. I just inhaled water. How did you inhale it?
*  I don't know. I was trying to drink it and I nailed it
*  That happens now. I sound weird, right? Yeah, you sound like a different person
*  Did the luminosity greatest judge just replaced me with somebody else? Yeah, you're too controversial all that shit
*  You were saying is to ride people up. All right, I think I'm better. I won't I won't inhale the water
*  Oh, that's it feels weird. Um
*  Kyle Kalinskis something today. I wanted you to see Jamie
*  It's some thing there's some shit going down with UFO sightings. Oh, yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, but they were new here I'll send it I'll send it to you. I've been following this stuff. Yeah, it's
*  Hold on a second, Jamie
*  All right, I just texted it to you
*  Pentagon
*  Officially releases UFO this is the tweet it says new Pentagon formally released three mysterious UFO videos captured by Navy pilots
*  The already leaked videos showed what DOD insists on calling unidentified aerial phenomenon
*  Moving at incredible speeds and performing near impossible maneuvers. This is a weird subject because
*  It's one of those subjects where people automatically dismiss it because it's been it's been so
*  Touted by kooks. There's so many wacky fucks that have talked about UFOs that
*  Anybody talking about UFOs has to be out of their fucking mind. But then when you see these videos and you see them performing these
*  Impossible tasks like these things are moving in a way that we've never seen anything move before
*  Flipping upside down and sideways moving at insane rates of speed
*  Like they don't know what these are
*  Yeah, you know phenomena what's interesting though is I was reading one of these stories and
*  They passively mentioned that the siding was near a technology a US naval like technology station of some sort
*  Mm-hmm, like a top secret development and I'm like that could be one of two things either right
*  It's developed by the people that are at that base or they're monitoring the people that are at that base
*  These aircraft we call them aircraft are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the US inventory nor any
*  Foreign inventory that we are aware of
*  Maybe they see this shit that's going down with China and all the ships being moved and like listen you fuck heads the aliens
*  Yeah, maybe they're like listen you fucking morons you
*  Territorial apes I'd like to think that but you don't think so Manhattan Project man
*  I mean the US has probably got some crazy motherfucking weapons
*  Could be but the Manhattan Project was also coincidentally right after they started detonating bombs and the aliens started showing up
*  That's what they think right? Yeah. Well that was when the bulk of US sightings started jumping and worldwide
*  I believe too, you know, maybe
*  We've slowly been getting more and more information about this. I've been actually reading a lot of these stories of the past several months
*  More admissions from government more release of documents and more sightings. So there's been a big I
*  Don't want to call it
*  Well a lot of people murmuring that April was gonna be the month when we finally learned the truth April's almost up
*  It's almost almost up. We got like a few days. I'm and 27th, you know what I use more days
*  Do you know 30 you know about happened? Yeah, do you know about the O'Hare airport sighting? Which one's that?
*  So this was I think in like oh six
*  At Chicago's International O'Hare a UFO came down and hovered above
*  I think I can't remember which terminal it was
*  Hovered for a few minutes. I think and then shot straight punched a hole in the clouds. Everybody saw it happen
*  Now I had just quit working at O'Hare around this time when the sighting happened. So I had friends who were still there
*  I had a friend telling me that when this UFO came down
*  People on Mannheim Road where which is the road on the side of O'Hare got out of their cars
*  like just stopped the light got up and we're looking and staring at it and
*  That the people who are working where we worked we worked for American Eagle Airlines
*  Walked out of the rooms and we're just staring at it float and then shoot up and punch a hole in the clouds
*  You know what they said weather phenomenon
*  So there's a photo of it a pilot took a photo of it. This is back when like very early phone cameras
*  It's a very grainy awful picture. There it is right there. That's that's not it. No, no, that's super fake. I think
*  No, these are all people trying to fake
*  It's really hard to find that one is not that one might be it but I don't think so it it barely looks like
*  Here UFO sighting 2006. Is that it right there? I do not believe those are it. No, so this will click on that
*  Article to what it says Jamie
*  That one might be on the left
*  but so many people try exploiting this stuff for for clicks and for reviews and they make these fake photos and
*  It was links not working
*  It was a very very faint photo from the from the cockpit it might be that one right there in the middle
*  On the no no so on the left side far left. It might be that one. No, no, that's not it. That's not it
*  well, there was a really crappy photo of it and
*  That might be it. That might be it was a really it was out of the cockpit of a window a pilot took a photo and
*  You know, I wonder where have all the sightings gone since phones became ubiquitous. I mean, there's a simple, you know
*  I guess excuse the aliens. They're sentient. They know we have phones. They're like, okay stop, you know decloaking or whatever
*  But I want or I wonder if you know, why is it there were so many UFOs and then around the time?
*  Cellphone cameras come out. They're gone. Well, I think most people are full of shit. Yeah
*  Yeah, I think most people like to pretend they see things that don't really see things but you know, I don't think that
*  excludes the possibility it's not like
*  It's it's not like it's these things are mutually exclusive like people are full of shit therefore aliens don't exist
*  I think aliens could be real and people are full of shit
*  And I think that it could be it's very rare that they visit us
*  But if they do like well, how often do scientists go to the Congo to study chimps?
*  I mean, how many people do they send let me let me the bottom of the ocean to look for new life forms
*  How rare is it? Let me trip you out. Okay on that idea. We put decoys up for animals
*  Animals can't tell the difference. What if you've actually met a decoy person you couldn't tell the difference. Maybe it's you bro
*  Maybe it's me. That's right. That's why you're able to work so much. Oh, yeah, we're all but you don't get tired
*  No, so you're interested in news and disseminating factual evidence because we're actually doing this collecting a database for the for the aliens
*  No, but I thought about this because I saw a photo on reddit of a puffin
*  I think it's called the bird and they put up a fake puffin and it's because I think they're called puffins
*  It's because the birds don't like, you know nesting in places where they're alone
*  And so I put in the decoy there the other birds would start coming and like one bird showed up and was hanging out with
*  The decoy and I'm like, could you imagine like you see like we put duck decoys in the water
*  We do duck calls and the ducks like oh wait fly honey. I'm gonna come over and check this out
*  And it's like a woodblock
*  Could you imagine like seeing like a beautiful woman or someone you're attracted to and being like, oh look at that
*  It's really like an alien decoy just to like probe you and like better understand you or something. Well the decoy
*  Just the term decoys weird because decoys are used for hunting like
*  Turkeys turkey season right now. Yeah, and the way the hunt most guys hunt for turkeys
*  They take a rubber turkey you put that fucker out in the middle of the field and then you hide behind a bush with a shotgun
*  And then right turkeys like hear it
*  And they come over and they try to get some pussy and then they get shot
*  So what if you know you see some dude and or it's like you see it for you
*  I'd be a beautiful woman. You want to get that pussy and you know, and then she's going like hey
*  Hey, come over here and you're like, oh, hey me and then I get eaten
*  No, no, they just you know, take it from the ship probe you and learn about your buddy
*  This is the thing about putting things up your butt
*  Don't even do that. Like they have MRIs now then aliens need to probe you in your ass
*  I think it's just what everyone's afraid of they're afraid of things go in their ass
*  So that's what they they think is gonna happen if the aliens get them. They're gonna freeze me
*  Somebody told the dumb story back in the day and it was the most sensational version everybody had to have it
*  So they were like that's what they went with, you know
*  Maybe or maybe they do that to keep you keep your mouth shut
*  They fuck you in the ass to see keep your mouth shut or some dude actually got abducted, right?
*  Yeah, and he comes back and he's like they think they won against me. They think they beat me. They put stuff up my butt
*  They're weirdos. Do you ever hear the story of Betty and Barney Hill? No, it's the very first UFO abduction story
*  It's an ancient story and what's crazy is Angela Hill who's a UFC fighter
*  I had her on the podcast and after the show she told me her grandpa was Barney Hill
*  Whoa, and I was like, holy fuck like we forgot to we didn't talk about it during the show
*  But she wanted to bring it up because she knows I'm kind of obsessed with UFOs
*  But the account that they have like they get hypnotized and he's recalling the abduction and they have like the same story
*  It's very terrifying you hear him crying and screaming and you know
*  They that he was taken aboard this craft and examined then brought back and they have missing time
*  But here's the thing if they only did that occasionally
*  They only came down once every few years and just scooped some person up in the middle of some
*  Rural place like if you're flying over, you know, I think their instance was in I believe it was in Maine
*  If you're flying over somewhere like Maine, which is a very low population state and you see a lone car
*  And it's just traveling along the highway and there's places in Maine where you go from like Portland to Bangor
*  When you're traveling on that road, it's like 60 miles with nothing not a gas station
*  Nothing if you were an alien you saw a car by itself like no other cars move in we got one
*  Isn't it just easier to think it's the US government?
*  No, why not? Because we don't have the capability doing something like that
*  I don't think I don't think the capability of the scientists working for the government is any different than the capability the science
*  scientists that are working for
*  You know project X or you know
*  fill in the blanks in terms of like what
*  Raytheon
*  publicly traded companies
*  How long look?
*  Quad copters don't seem all that complicated to me quad copters. Yeah, like a helicopter like drones, you know
*  We've seen a little toys you buy they got four propellers
*  Take take that concept use thinner, you know jets and surround it in a disc so that it's you know
*  universally like it can move in any direction because it's
*  Gotten, you know, it's what power source. Where's the gas tank? Well
*  lithium-ion battery or
*  Come on, man. You're talking space shit like this is this that hasn't even been invented yet
*  Think about how little mileage you can get out of a Tesla, you know, they had
*  Advances Tesla's you know still when it's going full out it can only go for I mean you get
*  307 miles if you drive like a grandma, but if you drive like a maniac you don't even get half that
*  You know that they I could be wrong with this
*  But I'm pretty sure that they had this flying platform in the 70s that uses gas power and they've also had jet
*  Yeah, for a long time. No, they've had sort of they've had jet packs that are capable of going for like 30 seconds
*  They don't I've experienced
*  I'm pretty sure the jet packs back in the day went for a long time. No, no, they definitely didn't we can lay it up
*  Yeah, let's look it up because I definitely didn't the whole thing was the fact they were burning gas and to propel you in the air
*  They only had a certain amount. I thought it was like 20 minutes 20 30 minutes
*  Maybe now my understanding of why we abandoned jetpack technology was that it was inefficient and heavy and you couldn't carry it without it
*  Being turned on so they opted for
*  Larger like, you know, like what are they called?
*  Chinooks helicopters that can carry multiple people multiple people at once when you're wearing a jet pack. It has to be on idle
*  Negating its own weight, which means it's burning as you're walking around which means you get a good 20 minute jump
*  And you got to abandon the tech and then you don't want your enemies to get it
*  Have you ever seen a guy fly a jet pack? Yeah, there's a video on YouTube. No, I mean in real life
*  Oh, I've seen that one guy the Iron Man dude. Well, I've been there in real life
*  My friend Willie B from in Denver on the radio. Yeah, he had a radio show in the morning
*  He's radio show. He still has a radio show shout out to Willie and
*  He had this guy who was a
*  Jetpack pilot who came in and in the parking lot of the radio studio and you know
*  Fans of the radio show came and did it too and watched it rather and this guy flew in the air for about 15 20 seconds
*  And then landed this guy was so banged up. He both of his legs were blown apart. He had
*  He had big braces on both of his knees. I'm like what happened your knees
*  He's like just crash landing both my knees are blown to shit had no ACLs and either one of his knees
*  But what I'm saying, it's good
*  This is back then it was good for about 30 seconds 30 seconds of flying
*  Well, so the point I was trying to get to is if you take something like a quadcopter
*  You could absolutely fuel it with with you know gas or be loud as fuck it but it would it would
*  Depending on how you mitigate be an engine be an engine. It would be loud as fuck and you'd hear
*  From the from the quad rotors
*  Yeah, but these what these people are describing is nothing like that
*  these people are describing things that are silent that go from zero to a
*  Thousand miles an hour in a split second the things that defy physics as we understand them
*  This is not something that I think that the US government has I don't I just if you look at like, okay
*  Like Elon Musk company project X or SpaceX SpaceX is right now one of the premier
*  Civilian companies private companies that's making rocket ships. They fuck up all the time
*  They're in the middle of innovating all the time. He's one of the smartest people on earth
*  He's one of the in terms of technology. He's what he knows as much about propulsion as anyone and they still can't get it, right?
*  They're still trying to figure it out
*  They're trying to come up with something that could be viable in terms of commercial spaceflight and they're working on it daily and
*  These these people are the brightest minds we know of right now
*  They're in this jet propulsion space travel business. There's you know
*  Virgins working on something is a couple other companies that are working on things as well
*  And then you have NASA which worked that the best they could come up with was the space shuttle, right?
*  Do you think that there was something way better than space shuttle?
*  They just never used that they had and they they kept it on the back burner
*  Didn't want to let anybody know but the way they would use it is they would pick people up and erase their memory and
*  Experimental asshole that's crazy. Well, that's less likely than the hundreds of billions of galaxies
*  Just in our own in our own known universe, right?
*  Each one with hundreds of billions of stars each star with who knows how many fucking planets that somewhere out there
*  There's something more advanced than us maybe a thousand years. Maybe a million years, but it's figured out how to come here
*  I got same question then why hasn't why why hasn't anyone discovered them?
*  Why is said he failed search for search for extraterrestrial intelligence? Why haven't the chimps invented guns?
*  They've started using more tools, but right why haven't they invented guns though?
*  I don't know. So why hasn't said he found UFOs the same fucking answer. They're not advanced enough yet
*  I really it's a it's a real simple answer. The industrial age is pretty fucking recent, right?
*  I mean you think about when people invented cars. You're talking about 1800. That's really recent and we've only used lights 1800s
*  Like high-power radio transmission is only in the past hundred years or so, right? Well, you saw you've seen the movie contact
*  Maybe that's an old one, right? It's Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey
*  It's based on Carl Sagan's book about contact with space and with with aliens. I think I'm gonna go down
*  I think I did see it recently. I can't interesting interesting take on it
*  But oh yeah, the idea is that they've received the signal that we sent out way way back
*  you know in the day actually when the
*  The first broadcast signal was Hitler
*  Announcing the Olympic Games the start of the Berlin Games and this was the first signal they got
*  there's a really controversial moment in the movie or controversy, you know in the plot with that once they
*  Were trying to decipher the image that was being sent. They realized it was Hitler
*  Yeah, the first thing they see is a swastika and what the fuck is this back to us?
*  And then they had to realize oh no, no, this is the first image that we sent out to space
*  They wouldn't be able to understand the political or historical context of this and well, so so I got a few
*  there's a few issues I see in terms of
*  aliens and Earth contact, right we are
*  Substantially more connected, you know in an evolutionary chain to ants than we are to any alien. So we
*  We can't communicate with them for the most part. We kind of can we understand how they communicate
*  But when an ant sees a superhighway, there's something I this is someone else's quote. They don't think twice
*  So it's possible there are aliens that have superhighways right above us
*  We can't tell what it is same as a dog doesn't understand other than stay away from it
*  but one of the one of the issues I I think is often neglected in the conversation about aliens is the
*  We assume aliens would be on a very similar planet to us
*  We assume that they would have some kind of gaseous atmosphere
*  perhaps it's a liquid atmosphere and one of the things that I would ask of a researcher because I'm not the expert is
*  The fact that we have the proper balance of oxygen the atmosphere to manipulate fire which allows us to you know separate elements and then create
*  computers and components and fuels
*  Wouldn't exist on a planet without the same, you know atmosphere we existed. They stop against that really easily
*  Yeah, there's no known propulsion system for any of these crafts. These things are not using fire
*  They don't have a heat signal. They don't know what they are. They don't know how they work. I don't mean propulsion
*  I mean the separation of elements
*  The manipulation of elements right so we we melt things and separate them and break them down
*  They don't believe it. That's how it works. No, but I mean like how do you even start from I'm sure there's an answer
*  You know, let's say you have you have a species that lives on a planet with no oxygen
*  It has no access to fire what energy like what dense energy source do they have that will allow them to manipulate matter?
*  Do you know the Rob Lazar the Bob Lazar story? I do. Yeah
*  well one of the things that he talked about when he first
*  Stopped working for area s4 and the government was tapping his phones and you know
*  There's there's a lot that can be documented about him
*  There's a lot that can't be but one of the things that he talked about was a thing called element 115
*  That element 115 this insanely dense element that they use to bend
*  Gravity and that the way he described the way the propulsion system works
*  It's like putting a bowling ball in the center of a very soft mattress and that all of the other
*  Mattress all the rest of the mass the mattress bends around the intense mass of the bowling ball and that this is how these
*  incredibly advanced
*  aliens from this other planet use
*  This is their propulsion system that was from Star Trek though
*  The the concept of warp was all around for a really long time
*  I think the concept is based on Einstein's theory of gravity
*  I mean, this is the whole idea if you could find something that could do that
*  But here's the thing when Bob Lazar talked about this in the late 80s early 90s
*  This element didn't exist right now. It does it wasn't it wasn't proven until they did it in a particle collider
*  I believe it was 2013 so he was talking about this element far before it was it was and he's apparently
*  This is the big rumor. He apparently had taken some of that from a lab
*  Yeah, and through George Norrie and it was a George Norrie. Yes, they did some experiments
*  on television and showed that this stuff had made
*  Light and fog bend in a way that they couldn't describe
*  He also didn't he also claim to see a small alien creature on his way out
*  He said he saw something that was sitting down
*  But he doesn't know if it was a model that they were using like if they had created something that was supposed to be the size
*  Of a thing that could fit in these crafts because these crafts he said were designed for things that were far smaller than human beings
*  I'm pretty sure in the initial interview
*  He gave when he went public was that he saw an alien and then later on changed it saying I don't know if it
*  Was maybe a model or a puppet
*  Yeah, he said he thought he saw something sitting down and two people standing over it looking at it
*  He said he thought he saw an alien, you know, but he's probably I mean, I don't know
*  I mean look he said it was literally for like a half a second
*  Like he's walking by a window and he sees something inside of it
*  Imagine being a guy who's in your 20s and you're a propulsion expert and it's been proven that he worked at Los Alamos
*  Labs and it's been proven that he did put a fucking engine. Yeah, it's been proven that he did put a jet engine on a Honda
*  I mean, he's a genius. He's a and then you talk to him. He's an incredibly smart guy now
*  imagine you get sent off to area s4 and
*  They show you this thing that you know doesn't even exist and they tell you about this propulsion method that they don't understand
*  and they say that they found this a long time ago in an archaeological dig and
*  They want you to back engineer it because you're a propulsion expert and they're running out of options
*  They've been studying this for decades
*  No one knows what the fuck it is or how you can make it work
*  And then they do test flights with this thing and then he tells his friends about these test flights
*  After he gets fought, you know how you got fired. Do you know a story about him getting fired leaked it or something?
*  No, no, his wife is fucking her flight instructor
*  Oh, and so when his wife is fucking her flight instructor, they told him he couldn't work anymore
*  He's like why not well they were tapping his phone because when you have top secret clearance to work on UFOs
*  I guess they don't want your fight your your wife fucking her flight instructor
*  I then you're gonna go crazy and you have you have a lot of
*  Imbalance at home, right? So he doesn't know why they don't tell him why so he takes his friends and he tells them
*  Listen, this is this is real. They're running these experiments. I know you thinking I'm crazy
*  This is what I've been working on
*  To this area where you used to be able to have access to but once he did this they closed off access and pushed it
*  Far back to where the public has access to and he showed them these things
*  Doing these impossible maneuvers in the desert in the night sky. This I remember and so then he gets arrested
*  And so when he gets arrested he was a fear. He was in fear of his own life
*  He goes public and tells this whole story and then they erase his past they erase the Social Security number
*  Their races education background even though people that knew him and knew he worked at Los Alamos labs
*  He takes George nori of a tour of Los Alamos labs knows the people that work there. They all say hi to him
*  He takes them a tour around the laboratory
*  Yeah shows them around shows them the the the devices they use for biometric security
*  and I think the one thing you can't ignore is that
*  He he there was there was documentation that he did work at one of these places
*  Yeah, and they later claimed he didn't yes and like I think I was watching the thing on maybe was Netflix
*  I think like he promoted that right was on yes
*  They show the paper like we found it. Yes, like he clearly was there. He was in the employee register
*  Yeah, no, but but you know for me, you know, man, I'd love to believe it all he's been insanely consistent about that story
*  Yeah for 40 years. I I want to believe you know, I mean 30 years whatever. I yeah, I want to believe too
*  Problem man picture didn't happen. I want to believe but that's nonsense picture. It didn't happen is nonsense
*  Well, how do you how do you you know, how do you?
*  What about Neanderthals? No, what about dinosaurs? There's no picks. I'm more so joking, right?
*  But I mean is show me the evidence right? I get it. Let's you know the challenge with any theory
*  I don't like I don't like saying conspiracy theory because they're not always conspiracies is that
*  People want something to be true and so they end up looking for things to justify what they think it already is of course
*  Instead of starting with what you've got and trying to figure out where it goes from there
*  But when you start with what you've got
*  You've got a guy who was living in Vegas was taking these flights out to area s4
*  Knows the place knows it inside out can describe it very accurately also worked at Los Alamos laughs
*  He was there I was that very accurately. Yeah, it proves he worked there. Yeah, but I thought Cruz
*  He's a little he's also a legitimate scientist. But what I mean when you talk to the guy, he's a brilliant guy
*  He's but he's not a nut right. What are you saying aliens? That doesn't mean aliens
*  No, I'm just asking like so it doesn't mean aliens, but that's what he was told
*  Right what he was told is this is something that has come from somewhere else and they're trying to figure out how to work it
*  How do you what if we're in a simulation and this was something that was left over code or it?
*  You know wasn't supposed to be placed in this curtain
*  What if there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to and that these things do you know my favorite?
*  I want to call it a conspiracy theory, but my one of my favorite stories is
*  Humanity emerged on Venus and that we destroyed the planet with a greenhouse effect
*  So we created the Ark project and took the DNA of two of every animal and loaded up on us on the last vessel
*  The Ark and went to terraform Earth and that the dumbest idea ever
*  It's hilarious though. They have two of each animal and then how many copies of those things do you make before they eat each other?
*  They got they got they got
*  They they just started seeding the planet and what people do again. I'm not saying it's I think it's a fun story
*  They argue that the Bible was
*  Like the stories being told and retranslated over hundreds of years to a lost civilization that had only one ship escaped the destruction of their planet
*  And I'm not saying it's true. I'm saying it's a fun story. I love that story. Yeah, it's fun
*  It would be a fun sci-fi movie, and then you end up with lost tech being discovered
*  Well, yeah, like Elon that say we have to get off of Earth
*  You know there's so many people that say we have to escape Earth
*  We have to we have to sort of colonize the solar system or colonize the galaxy
*  I agree and I think if we don't discover a better propulsion than hard chemical energy, we're not gonna do it
*  So yeah, well, that's why this is so compelling this idea that they're using some element that apparently is
*  impossible to to find here you can only create it with a
*  Particle collider, but maybe in whatever solar system
*  They are coming from you have a very different environment and maybe this element was the primary source for fuel
*  Maybe they figured that out a long time ago. I wonder if I'd love to talk to an actual physicist about this
*  Is there something with negative density?
*  What's that mean? So like you know things with density create an attraction through gravity because they the the pressure
*  That like their influence on space-time. I'm not an astrophysicist
*  So I can't explain to you perfectly but you know the larger the more dense the object the more pull it has
*  You know suck a very dense black hole for instance sucks you in then you know Mars has slightly less gravity than us because less dense
*  I wonder if there's something again this probably you know
*  I'm sure there's some scientists laughing right now what a moron but negative density something that would actually have a
*  push effect in terms of gravity in which case you could have some kind of object with where you can control expand and contract
*  Density so that you're pushing and pulling I don't know but Bob Lazar's perspective is if we showed a
*  nuclear reactor
*  to a
*  Civilization from the 1400s they would think we're doing witchcraft the other covenant
*  Yeah, they would think it is absolutely the craziest thing that anyone has ever seen or heard they would try to tamper with it
*  They'd all get radiation poisoning and die
*  They'd never be able to figure it out in a million years
*  If you just left it with them if you left some sort of a nuclear reactor with them, and you're he said this is
*  really how
*  Far advanced he believes these these aliens or whatever you want to call them are that they're
*  They're science their technology is indistinguishable from magic because they're so far ahead of us
*  Do you think they'd want to be involved with us beyond course testing us?
*  Why wouldn't you we study butterflies we study mice we study we study bugs on the other side of the planet
*  We send people on scientific journeys to go and look at frogs sure sure but I'm even sure are real anymore
*  Are we giving guns to chimps are we are we building forts for them and teaching them to use stone and I mean we've seen
*  Now there's more videos coming out showing I can't remember which primate species, but using more tools
*  Yeah, well they believe that stuff they believe that primates chimps have entered the Stone Age
*  Yeah, they're using them on a regular basis. Are we gonna go and teach them agriculture?
*  I mean do we do we do we teach chimps things all the time?
*  Each in toast yeah, but environments because that's the only way you can study them
*  Yeah, we teach I mean if we they had a civilization you can go to you knew they lived in an apartment
*  And you could study them that way
*  But you don't think that they would study if they found a planet like let's imagine if we found a planet
*  Okay
*  We found a planet and it's all just filled with octopus and these octopus are changing colors and just jacking fish and eating lobsters
*  We would be totally totally be fascinating absolutely well all innovation
*  Happens because people are trying to improve on initial designs now
*  Why do they try to prove an improve on initial designs?
*  They try to make things that are better make things that are more efficient make things that can do tasks that they can't do
*  Without these tools and then they their curiosity and their creativity causes them to expand upon these ideas
*  Well of course if something's going to be so far advanced that they didn't accept their current place in the universe
*  They don't even accept the fact they want to stay on this planet
*  They want to travel to other places
*  Do you know fucking insanely curious you'd have to be to lock you and three of your other three-foot buddies and a giant fucking?
*  Flying saucer and propel yourself through space. Oh, yeah, but you would have to be incredibly curious and
*  incredibly
*  Not just curious, but innovative they would have to be thinking about things they would have to be
*  Exploring things and of course you would want to come to a planet that is filled with people who have
*  Hundreds of different languages. They're all full of shit. They lie to each other constantly send videos through the air
*  They have weapons that they could blow each other up with yeah
*  I mean of course you would be fascinated by that
*  I think that's the least compelling argument that anybody ever says why would they mess with us?
*  Why would they care about us of course they would care about us? We are fucking interesting man
*  Well, I'll put it this way
*  I think if we saw like a group of chimps
*  Standing near like a water waterbed and then one chimp fashions some kind of bag and pulls it over its head
*  Jumps in the water and tries to go as low as he can for as long as he can but before coming back out
*  We would look at that like that is the stupidest attempt at scuba diving I've ever seen but oh my god a chimp
*  Just tried to scuba dive
*  So if there are aliens and they're in these amazing technologically advanced ships that can jump light speed manipulate gravity
*  They just watched us strap ourselves to an explosive and fire us off of our atmosphere where we're likely to die and they're like
*  This is the in stupidest attempt at actually going to space these guys trying to go to space
*  No, I wouldn't think about that way at all. I would think about look. There's a fucking space station
*  It's up there and people live on it. They shoot themselves
*  This is that they have a very crude form of propulsion right but they've figured it out because they don't have element 115 in their environment
*  Naturally so these dummies have to light things on fire and use a push off the back of it to shove themselves through normal air
*  And you know why they're not gonna give us that tech right now
*  Why would they give us that why why do they say give us tech why they wouldn't I'm saying why would they give us tech?
*  Why would any?
*  That's the weirdest argument ever that they're giving us things. I don't think they're giving a shit. No, I don't think so either
*  I think they're specifically not doing it and they wouldn't do it even if we wanted them to I think I think it's the it's an inverse
*  you you people
*  Let me a lot of people talk about how they're like sharing technology with us or something right you see that stuff in the kids
*  Yeah, I've heard those conspiracies the reason they won't is because we're we're trust. We're territorial we we fight each other
*  Oh for sure so look if they came down and went to Russia and said here's anti-graphic propulsion
*  What do you think Russia's gonna do? All right our planet now. They're gonna immediately expand rapidly their their populations gonna grow exponentially
*  And it's gonna cause massive turmoil between nuclear powers which could destroy themselves
*  Yeah, for sure so you're gonna use it as a weapon the smartest thing is to not share at all
*  Until we're a one world, you know society well also like look at what they look like
*  What aliens look like if you look at the iconic shape of an alien?
*  They have giant heads and genderless bodies like maybe that's the key to stopping war
*  You know no incentive whatsoever for people to be
*  Sexual or attractive everybody looks exactly the same we get over this idea of biological mating they reproduce through genetic engineering
*  Why not just be robots? Well, maybe they are like robots. Maybe that is like a robot artificial bodies where you know
*  Have you seen altered carbon? I haven't but I keep hearing good things about it
*  I just finished season 2 season 1 was awesome, but basically they have a thing called a stack
*  You said you finished season 2 season 1 is awesome that means season 2 sucks season 2 is a C plus
*  Season 1 is like an A plus
*  Like it's fun
*  But there's a thing called a stack in the base of their in their in their spinal column right below their their head
*  That stores their consciousness and they call their bodies sleeves and they kind of don't care when they die because they just get
*  You know, it's if you're poor you get really crappy sleeves, right?
*  But if you're if you're rich you get premium access military upgrade like high-tech very strong
*  But their bodies just become separate and you can also
*  Transport your consciousness
*  Interstellar like to other planets and then you wake up in a body and a different planet
*  That's how you go places now your consciousness travels. So yeah, I mean
*  Maybe aliens do that. Maybe there's there's not you know
*  I'm I find the the idea of the various alien life like bodies curious one of the one of the things I've read about
*  Is that it could be humans from the future?
*  Yeah, I've heard that too that makes sense
*  You think about what we look like as opposed to like what a chimp looks like
*  Yeah, and then you keep going further with that like oh the head will get bigger the bodies will get weaker
*  Yep, and then look there's a sort of a trend in this society today to be less masculine less feminine
*  More gender neutral. Yeah, these well so they them pronouns
*  Maybe that's all just part of the programming this this falls into another one of these conspiracy theories that the goal of the
*  Globalists is that in order to get access to alien tech we have to be a unified planet
*  Aliens aren't gonna get aliens really you've heard that one. Oh, yeah, it's all over the internet
*  That's why they're doing this so they're going with a one world order in order to get alien tech
*  Do you think the Galactic Federation is gonna gonna let a planet in which has got numerous governing bodies and nuclear weapons
*  I think there's a Galactic Federation
*  I'm just think I'm just kidding right about the point I'm making is there people online who believe this they believe
*  that if there is some kind of Galactic Federation or at least some kind of
*  Recognizable, you know different cultures that have some kind of set rule base, right?
*  Who do they negotiate with us Russia or China? And so the argument?
*  one of those theories is that
*  Interests on the United States who have access to the aliens know that they have to do everything in their power to unify the entire
*  Planet under one authority so that we can be entered into whatever alien, you know access would exist
*  But so long as we are nuclear powered competing territory territorial factions, they can't do it
*  Well that makes sense if that was the case
*  but you add in what you what you were saying about masculinity and gender and one of the things that I
*  Find interesting is that when it comes to this argument about removing masculinity?
*  There's there's kind of overlap with this idea of domestication you think about
*  Proto wolves proto dogs and dogs dogs are effectively wolf cubs perpetually. So
*  Wolves are aggressive territorial independent. I mean independent in the sense of like you're not gonna tame them
*  They're like I teach wolves. Yeah. Yeah, like you're willing to listen to you there
*  I mean I you can but it's like it's it's they agree with you or they don't you're you're you're following, you know
*  So an adult masculine tough human is gonna be like I'm independent. I'm in charge
*  They've got to remove that and domesticate us
*  So you get a bunch of weak effeminate genderless humans who are gonna be passive docile and agreeable. Yeah like dogs, right?
*  Yeah, I do. I have a whole bit about what wolves are and what dogs are
*  Yeah, and what men used to be right and what men are now
*  Yeah
*  I was thinking of this really cool idea for a sci-fi film where aliens come to earth and most humanity accepts domestication
*  And then 300 400 years from now, you've got regular looking 21st century kind of men and women
*  But then you have these five foot tall
*  super armored jetpack with plasma rifles that love and serve the aliens and we view them as
*  freakish genetic defects
*  So have you seen like oblivion with Tom Cruise? Yes, the aliens basically genetically engineered a whole bunch of Tom Cruise's
*  I was thinking of that kind of idea but also with domestication. That's an underrated movie by the way. That's cool
*  I love it. Yeah, very good movie
*  if if aliens came to earth and
*  Most humans agreed and then over time the humans that got access to life-saving technology
*  Special armor were the ones that were agreeable and less likely to be aggressive
*  They would bitch out just like the wolves pitched out and became a poodle and then you'd have wolves
*  So I thought of a cool idea for a story
*  You basically humans like raiding a chicken coop and the aliens are like, ah and they call their attack humans
*  Who jump out with like armor and crazy future tech from the aliens, but they're like these small
*  Dog like versions of humans, you know, like right desperately in love with the aliens, you know, right just like crying and love
*  Yeah, yeah wolves aren't like that
*  But I wonder if the people would eat those dog like people the way wolves eat dogs
*  well for the sake of
*  Of a fiction. No, we wouldn't have them do that. What would coyotes be?
*  Coyotes would be like this sneaky smaller, but our coyotes aren't weren't the product of domestication
*  I mean, they're just a separate canine breed I guess or species, right?
*  But I'm saying like they they they really never got domesticated. Yeah, that's what's interesting. It's like they're I
*  Mean you see a coyote version of humans. Yeah, the North Sentinel Island
*  Right, you know North Sentinel is yeah. Yeah, the people have never had contact. Yeah. Well, they've had several bad
*  Other people which are the arrows at helicopter stuff. Well, that's why they killed that guy
*  they killed the missionary killed the missionary because they were invaded in the
*  1800s by a guy named Maurice Vidal Portman who was a pervert slash explorer
*  Who you know would measure dicks and yeah take detailed descriptions of people's anatomy and genitals
*  I mean was it for legitimate research purposes? No
*  Fucking wacko. Just yeah fine people and run tests on them
*  Yeah, but that would be what we'd worried about with aliens to it, right?
*  That's why people are worried about them touching their asshole well, it's only the pervert aliens somebody posted this tweet they said
*  Something about like you need to realize the aliens who would come to earth aren't the cool nerds who want to like talk science
*  It's their the rich assholes who you know rat fuck their planet or dipping out
*  That's a silly way to look at it. Well, I mean us it's one possibility. I understand but that's us
*  We always want to look at things through like a human centric filter exactly
*  But if they're genderless things from from the future like what benefit would it be to get richer?
*  You know these they have their giant heads and they could travel the speed of light like this is this is why I really don't
*  Like I think it's Hawking's argument that we shouldn't we shouldn't be excited about aliens because whenever a more powerful
*  Civilization approach is a weaker one. They dominate it. Yeah
*  I don't buy don't buy that for two seconds in terms of aliens coming to earth that makes no sense
*  What do you what so the argument I buy what Hawking's argument? Oh, you don't that if aliens came to earth
*  They would enslave us to steal our resources
*  Well, I don't necessarily think they would enslave us to steal our resources
*  But if we were aware of them, they would become space daddy. Well, what he's what he's saying is like
*  You know when when the Europeans came to North America and spread disease and then stole land and started wiping everybody out
*  Like when a more advanced civilization meets, you know, you know, I don't think aliens would do that at all
*  It's like why not the way I the way I would view the most
*  devastating
*  Approach would be more like a gigantic vessel coming down and just
*  Slicing a skyscraper in half and stripping out all the copper and elements while ignoring the people
*  You know when we go to a habitat for animals, we're not going to like haha
*  We'll kill all the squirrels. We're like we're taking the lumber squirrels be damned
*  So we go into habitats where other creatures live take what we want and we don't care about the animals
*  We know we farm we kill all the mice and all little critters in there
*  We don't care
*  So I don't like the I don't think the argument makes sense that a more advanced civilization would come to earth and be like
*  Humans now you will serve us and it's our land now
*  They would have completely ignore us and just start taking stuff and crushing us and ignoring us
*  It wouldn't be but I don't think that's the most likely scenario either
*  I think any any race sufficiently advanced enough to travel the
*  Massive size of the universe would have little need for the primitive elements on our planet
*  And it would actually be substantially easier for them to go to any other empty rock. No, it's not true
*  We have no idea. No, we have no idea what they need like this might be an incredibly rare place
*  It's incredibly rare as far as everything we've been able to observe
*  they might come here because they found this Goldilocks plant that is liquid water and
*  Incredible biodiversity and more life than any other place on earth or any old place in the solar system
*  You know the or in the known galaxy, you know the heiress planet theory, right? What is that? That's
*  Ailee there's an elliptical orbit for a planet that every 300 years comes in con comes in close orbit to earth because elliptical around our Sun
*  Yeah, it's planet Nibiru Nibiru. That's yeah
*  Yeah, and that they they used human slave labor for mining gold. Yes, that's all Zechariah Sitchin
*  Yeah, you know Zechariah Sitchin is I've heard the name. I've read the stuff. He wrote a book called the 12th planet
*  That's a fascinating take on
*  the ancient Sumerian texts and he's widely
*  Been criticized by other scholars who understand ancient Sumerian
*  Yeah, and there's actually a website called Sitchin is wrong
*  See if you can go to it Sitchin is wrong calm because all the whack jobs like me who love the idea of you know
*  Oh, that's why we're so into gold man, right?
*  Because the aliens use these suspended gold particles in their atmosphere to protect their atmosphere from
*  deterioration by their you know in
*  Industrial use of chemicals and toxins has destroyed their environment
*  So sit Sitchin is wrong calm is an interesting website and I don't know who's right or who's wrong
*  And I think if you want to go over the Anunnaki and the ancient
*  but what's really interesting and not just about Sitchin but about Sumer in general is
*  one thing is
*  They had these tablets these clay tablets that had a depiction of the galaxy or the depiction of the solar system
*  Now you're talking about
*  6000 BC
*  They have this depiction of the solar system that shows the Sun in the center and it shows all the planets in our known
*  Galax or a known solar system with a proper perspective in terms of the size of the planet and the proper distance like they're in
*  The right places it's not like there's a big one really close to the Sun
*  And there's a little one three planets out like see if you can find that it's a weird image see that's the image
*  Yeah, right. Yeah, they're the take that
*  Zechariah Sitchin had was that they were trying to tell us that they have come from this other planet
*  And they were trying to explain to us what our solar system is
*  But just the fact that they have this Sun in the center
*  And then they have all the planets that we know of
*  Circling this Sun and this has been criticized like oh no, they didn't do it right. They didn't do it
*  First of all, they did it in clay. Okay, so relax
*  There's so it's so goddamn close that you would have to say man that might be what that is
*  And if that is what that is
*  What are they trying to say with this thing because there's also an image from a clay tablet of a very large
*  Being that has a very small human like being with a monkey tail on its lap
*  and this is what Sitchin points to as
*  some sort of a depiction of the genetic engineering that took place to turn
*  Primitive primates into human beings
*  this is the reason why we are so different from every other animal on this planet and
*  the real thing that
*  When when people talk about aliens and alien cow like what would aliens be doing here? Why would they do what if?
*  Human beings are the product of accelerated evolution like what if they came down here?
*  They found this incredibly rich planet
*  It's filled with
*  Biodiversity and all these different life forms and then they found these primates and like oh we know where these fuckers are going like this
*  Is us ten billion years ago or whatever the fuck is let's accelerate this little party
*  let's inject some of our super advanced DNA into these primates and
*  Let's see. Let's see where it takes itself. So what do you think you think? Yeah, that's a fun story, right?
*  That's the story that they told Bob Lazar
*  But Bob Lazar said I don't know if they told me that to throw us off the trail if it's disinformation
*  or if it's just some wacky thing that they came up with to just to
*  Like have a crazy story that the scientists couldn't tell anybody
*  So if you do tell people like what are you working on?
*  I'm working on a reverse engineering or propulsion system from an aircraft that came from another planet
*  And by the way, right we are a product product of accelerated evolution
*  They came to us and they injected our DNA and you know
*  well think about that story in the context of ancient religions and a lot of the
*  commonalities notably like Abrahamic this idea that we were created that we were told we shouldn't shouldn't do certain things so
*  I think these are all fun stories. But yeah, you could look at the idea of
*  Someone being the son of God, you know a hybrid right? Yeah, you could look at the stories of regular old Genesis taking the rib of
*  Adam to create if well, yeah the genetic matter sure and then manipulating it. So
*  you know, I
*  Get I get a lot of heat from my more religious friends for pointing that out that I believe the Bible is more likely
*  And an odds base to be about aliens and about the actual creator of the universe and I'm talking astronomical odds like ridiculously astronomical
*  But I think we actually know some things exist genetic manipulation cargo cults
*  We know how primitive life form reacts to more advanced technology
*  They don't understand and that would would make more sense to me than you know
*  Believing in a hard religion about the creator and you know carpenter son things like that. Yeah
*  Well, it's also we're dealing with translations
*  Yeah, right that have gone on for thousands and thousands of years that are a story that was told as an oral tradition
*  for a thousand years before that like boy the
*  saying hard and fast
*  Exactly what they meant in the Bible and what this means and what must have happened for them to write that down
*  To me is just bonkers. I mean, yeah who who knows?
*  But what we do know is that the older the stories get the weirder they get
*  Like that's one of the weird things about the ancient Sumerian texts is that you're dealing now you're in like the six
*  Thousand years ago range. Yeah, which is really weird. Like that's a long fucking time
*  I saw that conversation with that dude about the Sphinx. I think he said was like 9000 BC or something
*  Well, this is a Graham Hancock and or Robert shock Robert shock who is a geologist at Boston University is actually
*  Taken the time to examine the erosion around the outside of the Sphinx
*  He does this thinks itself has been worked on a lot. There's been a lot of
*  Rehabilitation of the paws they've sort of rebuilt it which is kind of a shame
*  But it's it's made out of a sort of a soft stone. Yeah, it's eroding and falling apart and
*  When they found the Sphinx like when Napoleon found the Sphinx it was buried it was buried under sand
*  So this is the thing that had been buried in and re-exposed
*  like many times they think throughout history and what Robert shock had found in discovering this the
*  Temple where the Sphinx was carved and the the area that surrounds the Sphinx was as deep fissures in the walls
*  That were indicative of thousands of years of rainfall
*  The problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was
*  9000 BC right, right
*  So they're dealing with like and and you have to go back thousands of or 9000 years ago
*  But you have to deal with
*  Thousands of years of rainfall prior to that to create this so that means that this was
*  something that was clearly carved by man has
*  thousands of years of rainfall that eroded it and you're dealing with a time period where the last time they had
*  This rainfall in this area was
*  Thousands of years before they think people were even capable of building things like this. Maybe it was the lizard people
*  You know that theory about the super intelligent dinosaurs that flood underground
*  No, but there's so many wacky theories. It's funny what I'll roll my eyes at isn't it even slightly
*  even tiny tiny bit more likely that humans came from a different planet and
*  After they destroyed it and then reseeded and we lost our way of life
*  Yeah, it's possible
*  Look if we're gonna go to Mars like what is the fucking origin tale gonna look like a hundred thousand years from now once we go
*  To Mars, let's take the the the the climate change
*  You know global warming stuff to its logical conclusion of rising tides and a greenhouse runaway greenhouse effect, right?
*  So we we build one ship Elon Musk builds one ship with a very small crew of you know
*  How many people are gonna be on that? Do you know on his?
*  Gotta have some chicks though. Yeah, I think I repopulate the earth, right?
*  So it's got to be men and women and the people are gonna have to be
*  Boy heterosexuality is gonna be favored because you really can't have gay people that aren't gonna breed
*  You know you have two lesbians like oh we need to have it only populated by lesbians. Well, there's no more
*  Do you guys have buckets of sperm and a turkey baster?
*  Cuz how else you gonna make people when you're over there?
*  I was reading that they're gonna go with people who are already coupled and they're gonna you know with like ten couples or whatever
*  I don't know about Elon Musk specifically, but that was like a wife swapping going on in space. They did talk about that, too
*  I was reading like the the most optimal theory for colonizing Mars would be like polyamorous people something like ten
*  People already coupled now that they're polyamorous, but they expect there's gonna be commingling eventually expect commingling
*  Oh, so it's burning man in space, but but but check it out. Let's say let's say we sent a Mars expedition
*  You know ten families. We've got you know, two of each. They start having kids. We send cargo there
*  We they start building and then earth wipes itself out runaway greenhouse. We can't get a control things nuclear war, whatever
*  Right the planet becomes a desolate wasteland. There's no more communication to those who are on Mars
*  So the last remaining, you know hundred or so people who are now on Mars the adults who remember earth write down a book
*  Here's everything happened. Here's what you should and shouldn't do
*  Here's how we lived and they give to their kids now their kids never experienced earth
*  They know nothing about it
*  In fact those kids only have a fleeting image of the technology that they once had now go two more generations down
*  The old tech where we used to colonize Mars is now decaying and falling apart
*  They've not yet to fix it the original colonists are dead go down three more generations
*  Now I've got a few thousand humans start moving off looking for resources and no one has any idea earth even was a real thing
*  Other than the stories they heard about the military leader in the in the in the orbital orbital space station who long since died
*  So now they have this book
*  They don't fully understand their language is now changing as they separate from each other and find different areas of the planet
*  Now English or whatever language they were speaking becomes ten different languages now, they're translating the book now
*  It's a thousand years later
*  They don't even know earth existed and they have this weird book about the way things used to be and now of the billions of you
*  Know now we're ten thousand twenty thousand years in the future and they find you know, these old ancient relics and they're like
*  I wonder what if you don't even smoke pot do you know, I mean I don't smoke imagine if you did
*  My you know did you have so many more of these theories?
*  That's a good theory, but I that's to me. That's the logical conclusion
*  That's why I like the story of like humans came from Venus. I'm saying it's true
*  There's a
*  There's a group of people from Africa that actually the the dogon the dojon people
*  is that what it is dogon people and
*  They they talk about
*  the very specific
*  area of Mars where human beings came from and they have a
*  really weird
*  understanding of
*  Cosmology like they they know some things that they like hmm
*  Where'd you what and their their origin story is that people were living on Mars and that they destroyed Mars and how to escape Mars?
*  And come to earth
*  There you go
*  It's sort of a very similar version of it and now when you add that to what they know about Mars
*  that Mars used to be like a
*  hospitable place to tell me water
*  Yeah, well think about this way too. Let's say that we had an orbital space station over the new planet. We're terraforming. Hmm
*  What kind of
*  Government would exist. Let's say earth is wiped out, right?
*  The only survivors on an orbital space station over Mars with a small colony on the base
*  It's gonna be a military dictatorship not intentionally not from this evil perspective, but from a
*  You're the general you're second-in-command. We've always operated this way. It's a military mission
*  You know the person who's in charge is in charge and then eventually you build up the colony to a certain point where
*  Second and second-in-command or one of the favorite lieutenant says it's time to enact democracy
*  And the general says fuck no
*  And then a civil war breaks out in the heavens people on the ground watching the ships shoot at each other and blow each other
*  Up and then all the technology gets wiped out. You should really start smoking pot. No, no, you know
*  You know, but there's a lot of ways to interpret like various ancient spiritual religious texts in a science fictiony kind of way
*  So I actually you know talk to my friends about this we like kind of
*  What if what if the Bible and and you know, the Old Testament were viewed from a science fiction perspective not to be disrespectful
*  I'm not trying to disrespect anyone's religion or anything like that
*  But like what if we tried to apply a lens of from a futuristic perspective of our understanding of technology
*  To how they may have viewed what was going on back then. So you know what the cargo cults are
*  Yes for those that don't it's you know, these natives on these islands saw planes didn't know what they were
*  So they built effigies of the planes like I guess hoping they'd come back or whatever
*  So when I saw that I wondered, you know, a lot of people ask that question
*  What if we did the same thing with aliens and the other question is what would we do if we destroyed our own planet?
*  Like people say we are and how would that how would that you know result in a government?
*  How that result in stories?
*  it would be so funny if we destroy this planet we go to Mars and
*  Repopulate Mars and fix it up and then destroy that place and come back to earth after we're done
*  Cuz like look at what's going on right now during this pandemic
*  The skies are clearer than ever before the Venice canals in Italy have dolphins in them now
*  You could see the ground jellyfish you realize how disgusting we are and how we're gross like what we've done
*  The Los Angeles is amazing and in just a month and a half. The air is pristine crystal clear. You could see forever
*  It's a different world now imagine if that's what happens if we go to Mars we fuck that place up come back to earth
*  Look, it's fixed. We're back
*  You know, I guess if we can sustain our technology. Yeah, did you find that dogon tribe find that?
*  It actually said it's talking about Siri right
*  But didn't they have something about Mars as well?
*  I typed literally that and Mars and that just took me to serious stuff instead of Mars. So yes
*  Yeah, the the star the star serious the but they they understand they have a pull up a story out on it
*  If you can't it's a weird thing in terms of like the cosmology like what they understand and this is you know
*  Relatively primitive tribe that has this origin story
*  Well, it's like the end of a battle star
*  The end of Battlestar Galactica
*  They find earth the fucking new Battlestar Galactica is so good. Isn't it? Yeah, it's one of the more reason
*  Yeah, then the more recent one one of the most underrated science fiction series ever. It was so good
*  Well not not to act like my ideas are original the the series ends with them discovering a habitable planet. Yes with
*  What did it would
*  spoiler alert spoiler alert with a
*  Species that's compatible with them. Yes, they find primitive humans. Yes, and so if that story, you know, it's an interesting story
*  Yes, we would lose all knowledge of the previous planets and technology
*  Well, imagine if we flew to another planet for the first time we landed there and it's like
*  1940s America
*  Like whoa, maybe we do if we could fuck them, you know, they'd be weird press with you
*  Well, what if what if we find a spaceship underground with ancient tech and we don't know what it is and it turns out
*  It's ours the Dogon tribe the nomo and their fascinating cosmic knowledge deep in northwest Africa more precisely in Mali
*  We find one of the oldest most fascinating ancient cultures to develop on earth
*  So the ancient Dogon tribe is known for the religious traditions ritual dances their massive ritual masks their wooden sculptures and their architecture
*  However, they're also known for their incredible astronomical knowledge and their fascinating
*  Mythological accounts the Dogon have a compelling ancient tradition
*  They mentioned myths and legends that go thousands of years into the past predating possibly even their own history
*  Some authors like Robert Schott, who's also the guy from Boston University
*  He's the geologist that talked about the Spanx argue that the Dogon were people who originated in Africa
*  But who had been forced to leave ancient Egypt due to their religious persecutions
*  It is in his opinion that the Dogon may preserve ancient Egyptian traditions and myths
*  That may even have been carried into the present age claiming that the Dogon have a powerful
*  Cosmic connection I can go on for this will take too long to read. Yeah, cuz I'm just gonna just
*  What is that?
*  coincidence ancient knowledge well, it's just they understand the the cosmos and
*  You could you'd have to go into the story, but it's a weird story
*  It's a weird like oh, how do they know this like what what a weird origin story, but you've seen that guys the originals
*  Yes, where you know in the first segment he talks about the three kings of Orion's belt pointing to the star in the east
*  Where the Sun rises in the third day? Yeah, yeah, maybe maybe their stories are just just that you know
*  We what what could we do but stare at the sky and that's good point
*  Yeah
*  When you stop and look if you were traveling across the country as you were did you get a chance to stop and look in?
*  The middle of nowhere at the sky at the sky of course fucking amazing. Yeah, just ridiculous
*  Isn't it gross that we're robbed of that?
*  Yeah
*  And it wasn't it there was a story that I think in Los Angeles the power went out this blackout in the 90s and the police
*  Got tons of calls from people who didn't know what they were seeing in the sky. It was the Milky Way galaxy
*  Those are the same people that are injecting Lysol right now
*  They aren't though
*  You know somebody might it's probably a few
*  Yeah, well you know if you're gonna
*  What about the chloroquine thing you know the the one form of chloroquine that was?
*  But the the form that was a pond cleaner. Oh, yeah
*  The lady your husband, but here's the thing the lady wasn't she like a Democratic contributor donor
*  She had tweeted that Donald Trump was a psycho that and and her husband took the stuff
*  Well, there's new reporting that says the husband was an engineer his friends are shocked that he would do something so stupid
*  So the wife poisoned him
*  That's the theory that's going around now now the fair point brought up
*  I think this was a free beacon is that he trusted his wife, and he loved her
*  Wow, and she gave him poor. She's really dumb
*  But I'm fuck out of apparently a couple decades ago. She had struck him. There's a report about it decades ago
*  Yeah, 20 years I think but there's also reports and you guys you got a fact of this stuff for sure because it's not like
*  Something I've not been diving too much too deep into but she was trying to divorce the guy
*  So the story popping up is that so she's the cow baskin of chloroquine. That's what people have been saying
*  Yeah, like the rumors going around, but whether or not any that's true. It's like you know I always say give me the proof
*  But I can't say this
*  the media loves to run everything the president says through a filter of
*  Like it must be taken literally or to its worst most
*  The opposite of benefit out the the most negative conclusion possible if he says it we're gonna run the most negative interpretation
*  It's bad. It's awful. Yeah, so when he says something like you know that that Peter Navarro instance where he said
*  You know your nasty reporter. He said about hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine it might work
*  It might not but I'm optimistic what are the press run with Trump recommends untested dangerous drug
*  Meanwhile you get unscrupulous press don't all press ran with that right right of course
*  But but look when Andrew Cuomo came out and said we're gonna start trialing
*  You know chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and is it their my son?
*  Where was the negative press didn't they say that that has actually been proven to kill more people than not using it though?
*  I think one of the sticks yeah one of the initial stories to come out said that it was actually more likely to kill
*  So the CDC had listed that this was actual treatment used by many countries and we have there's a lawmaker in Michigan
*  She's a Democrat
*  She was given the treatment she had saved her life, and she personally praised the president for it for that
*  She's being censured and being stripped of any
*  I've heard of that so it's crazy it is it is there's a reason why they were using it
*  They showed it showed some promise with some people
*  I guess the idea was that the the extreme immune system reaction in your lungs was killing people
*  Mm-hmm the swelling and the fluid buildup so by suppressing the immune system
*  You would stop that from happening the symptoms would abide and you'd eventually recover
*  You know what man?
*  If the media there's a graph showing the amount of press Obama got versus Trump what Trump got and I think to a certain degree
*  Trump brought some himself because he chased after this press and he and he baits them and he goes after him right but it's like
*  Three or four times as much news, but it's also a different world now if you go back to 2008
*  2008 rather when Obama was elected the influence of
*  like online media and the
*  Ability to pull eyes away from traditional media sources was nothing was nothing like people newspapers were still real
*  People were buying newspapers. Yeah, I mean
*  Mainstream media was the only way you got your news now. There's people like you you know
*  There's there's there's people like Kalinsky or Jimmy Dore. There's there's people like the hill they have these online platforms
*  Where this is they're not only they more viable than the traditional media outlets. They're more accurate
*  They're they're less biased they're they're younger more intelligent
*  And they're not connected to some gigantic media machine that has a very consistent bias
*  I think we're seeing substantially more bias than ever before and
*  CNN from online things from from from everything from everything but it starts with
*  People like me so look I'm an individual. I have an opinion there are things that I think are more important than other things
*  I look at this establishment press this behemoth constantly lying to people not every single journalist
*  I know many journalists. They're fantastic at their jobs. They risk their lives. They do good stories even political reporters
*  You know my respect to Ben Smith formerly of BuzzFeed News now New York Times calling out the New York Times
*  Well sort of for their defense of Joe Biden calling out CNN
*  Right, there's great reporters, but you have a lot of people in media whose their goal is just survive make money
*  And so what happens with YouTube one of the reasons
*  I think they started censoring a lot of channels is what works shock content sensational rage bait mm-hmm
*  So YouTube hard suppresses that it's not entirely fair
*  But there's no real good answer to how you deal with this and it's unfair to a lot of independent creators because like you mentioned
*  YouTube doesn't know better. They're like who's credible, but CNN starts adopting the same tactic so now
*  You know CNN realizing they can't win no matter what they do. They're competing with with free videos on Facebook
*  You know you know mom and pop who post that video from the rally on Facebook cost them nothing
*  They don't care and CNN's got to pay someone thirty to fifty thousand dollars a year to low level to make this kind of content
*  They're losing so they switch it up now. We're being told that there are
*  Accountability you know our a credible your credible news outlets authoritative sources
*  They're the same thing as what the youtubers were look
*  I mean when you get Don Lemon going on on the show asking if a black hole swallowed an airplane
*  How is that any different from the crack pots on?
*  What Don Lemon asked a guest if a black hole swallowed the missing Malaysian airplane
*  Wait a minute. He was serious. He said I know it's preposterous
*  But is it preposterous and the woman responded we have to see this totally yes, Don Lemon Don Lemon
*  Asked about a black hole swung an airplane. I get a kick out of him. I like when he gets mad, but it's performative
*  It's not real news, so you know I think it's great
*  I think we're seeing a certain kind of crater emerge that are good. I think Jimmy and Kyle are awesome
*  I think I do a good job. I don't think I'm perfect, but I think we're all biased
*  And so that's why I always tell people you can't just watch me like you definitely got to watch Kyle, Pacman
*  Or or Jimmy Dore, and I get a lot of heat because people like you always recommend these left-wing channels
*  I'm like alright Steven Crowder. You know for instance
*  Sticks hex and hammer these are good good YouTube channels, but we're biased
*  I think we all try to be as honest as we can these big corporate channels are trying to survive
*  They don't care about honesty so Brian Stelter on CNN actually said he shows a bunch of videos from Fox News and says don't
*  Watch the spin watch us. We're gonna give you the facts
*  Don't look man if someone tells you not to seek information outside. I wouldn't trust that
*  I don't want to tell you what to listen to but I will tell you if you only watch my stuff
*  You're missing out you got to watch other perspectives. I want to see Don Lemon and Brian Stelter on naked and afraid
*  Out in the woods you get trying to get by saying the black hole thing he did it this is from
*  2014 oh yeah, was that when it was from I think so he has a while ago. Let me hear him say that
*  What it was something fully that we don't really understand a lot of people have been asking about that about
*  Black holes and on and on and on and all of these conspiracy theories. Let's look at this Noah says
*  What else can you think about black hole Bermuda Triangle?
*  And then Deji says just like the movie lost and of course it's also they're also referencing the Twilight Zone
*  Which is a very similar plot. That's what people are saying. I know it's preposterous, but is it preposterous you think Mary?
*  Well, it is a black holes about you know a small black hole would suck in our entire universe
*  so we know it's not that meter triangle is often weather and
*  Lost is a TV show so I think okay. I always like things for which he's just being
*  Provocative to get someone to answer a silly question. It's being bandied about on the internet
*  He's not saying it like he believes it no no what I mean is that he's he's presenting the conversation
*  That's what it's become. It's become well. I think he's doing that because first of all back then I mean this was 2014
*  I think people were just starting to understand like the impact of comments and
*  And they were addressing them, and they were probably trying to silence a lot of the nonsense
*  But then you get a woman saying a small black hole would small swallow the whole universe yeah
*  Well, I don't think she's a real expert if she said that right
*  So why why is Don Lemon asking nonsensical questions to guests who can't answer them properly at all well
*  He's just trying to be provocative. I get it. I get it and so what I mean to say is that you're watching this
*  Look at where they were in 2014 look where they are now with faking the Chris Cuomo thing they've they've
*  His idea the Chris Cuomo is no pretty gross. Did you hear what he said on his radio show?
*  No, what he said he said I don't find value in what I do. I think it's ridiculous
*  He said I don't like what I do for a living. I don't like my occupation
*  I think you know and then he said something the effect of I'll never beat them in reference to like Hannity and
*  Maddow or something like that. I think in my program in ratings. Yeah in ratings. So he's their biggest show
*  He is I'm pretty sure Cuomo is their biggest show
*  Yeah, he's the only one that seems to be a man, and he doesn't crack a million in the ratings really
*  Yeah, it's like eight and I think it's like 800 to 900
*  I think he periodically might the ratings might be going up I could be wrong so check the latest stats
*  But I think here's what I think have it
*  I think the CEO producers went to him and said look man you got this thing like we should we should we should run with it
*  Let's like go to your house. We'll film it. We'll make it this big deal. I think so, and I think it wasn't that bad
*  I think he had mild symptoms. Look the dude went out the guy left his home
*  He was not when he was talking about the the issues he was having
*  He was he seemed normal right like here's what I would expect from someone who is as sick as he seemed to be
*  I don't feel that good, but hey, I'm one of the lucky ones now. He's totally normal. Yeah, that's what I would expect
*  He's saying he's shivering so hard. He's chipping his teeth seems ridiculous. Yeah, it doesn't seem
*  I don't know I mean
*  Maybe when it's nighttime and you're tired because one of the things I remember
*  Last time I was sick was quite a while ago at the end of the night
*  I'd be like really achy because I was tired and I was as I was tired
*  my immune system would be depleted and then I would feel the effects of the cold more and
*  Then you wake up in the morning. You feel a lot better. Maybe pop some ibuprofen. I know he was taking Tylenol
*  So I'm supposed to take ibuprofen for this for some reason
*  Well, he said I think he was taking my friend Michael
*  Yo said that he was told to take ibuprofen and when he did it made it way worse. Oh, yeah
*  Well, so here's here's what can I say? I'm not gonna accuse the guy a lot of people are for penny
*  I don't think that's the case. He probably got sick. He tested positive, but I think he it seemed fairly mild in comparison to other people like
*  Michael yo when I talked to him
*  Well, first of all when he was doing a video talking about recovering from it was coughing. Yeah, even in the video
*  He was coughing when he was talking about on Instagram thanking everybody
*  But he had a bad case of it where he got pneumonia and it was rough and you know, Michael's a healthy guy
*  So that was disturbing to me, but the Chris Cuomo version of coronavirus didn't seem that scary the dude wasn't quarantined
*  Okay, he went out to some property 30 minutes from his home presumably with his family
*  He was witnessed by somebody else. You're not supposed to do that, right?
*  No, you're not. I mean, it's not just that but on CNN
*  They said he was locked down right they did this whole reveal where he comes out of the basement
*  I've been waiting for this didn't you also do a tick-tock dance with his daughter
*  I think he did but I think the reason he went on his show complaining was because
*  It was coming the producers told him to do this fake thing
*  And he didn't want to do it. He won't you right? Look man. I worked when I make sense
*  He can't call them out because he wants to keep the job when I worked for
*  You know one of these companies they told me to side with the audience
*  We talked about it last time I was here
*  Mm-hmm
*  They wanted me to create a narrative that the audience agreed with because we were there to serve them. What was the narrative?
*  Young progressives, whatever they say
*  So social justice
*  So whatever young progressives say you want to side with that and I told him I asked are you saying that if there's a factual?
*  News story that would be upsetting to our audience. We won't cover it. He said I think that's fair
*  Yeah, what was it that AOC said recently that people shouldn't go back to work that they should they should revolt like they should yeah
*  They should protest
*  Like not not go back to work that to me was one of the craziest things I've ever heard a politician say like if anything
*  We need to get the goddamn economy back on track. I wonder if she's gonna lose in her primary
*  She's going up against a woman named Michelle Caruso Cabrera
*  Who is a moderate who actually sounds very reasonable and it and it kind of breaks my heart a bit because I remember how Democrats
*  Used to be like you can look at the things she talks about and she's a very reasonable like she's got like a book
*  she was an anchor for some I think for like CNBC or something and she comes off like I
*  Don't know kind of like maybe you or me just how what used to be left before they went became radical activists and for social
*  Justice why do you think they went that way? Why do you think everything?
*  You think so? Yeah, so yeah, there's a couple different theories. I have on it
*  Conservatives are less likely to be online in a lot of areas of the country. They have weaker internet
*  But they're so active online they dominate for sure and that's one of the reasons they're like, you know
*  They get wiped out a lot, but you look at we're talking about conservatives
*  Yeah, yeah concert is getting banned a whole lot because they're very active. They do a lot of memes
*  But I think so how are you saying that they're less likely to have good internet rural
*  Rural towns rural have really bad internet, but it's good enough to be able to post on Twitter. Like what do you mean?
*  No, yes, they have phones but with if you've got dial-up in the middle of the country
*  You're not posting a video or a photo. You are watching on your phone. You are watching dial-up
*  Yeah, that's true. Everyone's doing it through their phones. That's a good point
*  What I think is that you've got a lot of older people that are conservative a lot of younger people that are liberal and there's there's
*  issues there with how people interact online, so
*  My assumptions my opinions things I've read older people more likely to just follow and read younger people more likely to engage
*  Most people not likely to engage at all. It's something I think like 2% of the country actually is actually active on Twitter
*  Yeah, but you end up with internal biases at the social media companies
*  Who is authoritative and who isn't echo chambers?
*  So a really good example is like a BuzzFeed news wrote a story that the Wuhan bio lab
*  Leak theory is a right-wing, you know popular right-wing theory Trump supporters are pushing it and here's why it's wrong
*  But CNN ran multiple segments about this
*  And so when when you have digital media framing things as always like you ever wonder why they never say left-wing
*  You know like in the media they'll say conservatives did X
*  They never say liberals did X because they view themselves as those people, right?
*  So you end up with social media companies that view that kind of content as authoritative left-leaning you end up with left-wing activists and
*  Acceptable marketability. There was a study done where they tracked
*  essentially like it's a
*  Visualization of location for various aspects of the internet conservatives are in this bubble liberals in this bubble
*  marketing digital marketing companies overlapped with
*  resistance Twitter anti Trump
*  so what ends up happening is
*  Big marketing firms based in New York City based in Los Angeles very urban areas much more likely to be blue have a blue perspective
*  They run commercials based on a left-wing perspective
*  Politicians see it with the television is saying they see what the websites are saying and they say this is what America wants
*  It's not it's what the hyperactive 2% of Twitter wants so they fall into that trap where they believe all this stuff
*  The reason Ocasio-Cortez became got elected
*  She won I think said she got 17,000 votes in a district of 750,000 like that's not winning a real election
*  But it was an exploit it was exploiting the system. So you end up with someone who has views that don't represent
*  The overwhelming majority of this country in a very high-profile position
*  influencing Nancy Pelosi and
*  What you know one of the reasons they think they even went forward with impeachment
*  Was because Ocasio-Cortez gave a statement where she said it was a bigger scandal that the Democrats would not impeach Trump
*  Next thing we know Nancy Pelosi hops on board with the idea and that blew up in their face Trump ends up seeing his approval
*  He raises a ton of money it would be really interesting if what did him in was the Lysol shit oh
*  That was bad for him though. Yeah, but I don't think imagine. Yeah, I don't think it'll be it
*  What do you think is gonna happen?
*  in November as of right now, there's
*  The panic factor could be good for Trump the fact that we're in a crisis may mean people are desperate for security and they don't
*  Want to take a chance? They don't want to take any chances and Trump is a bully like I don't mean that necessarily as like
*  You know to the Trump supporters get mad what I mean is like he's
*  He pushes people around and a lot of people like that about him that he he yells at the press
*  What a lot of people on the left don't get is when he yelled at that CNN guy
*  You're a nasty reporter his base was clapping standing up saying thank you for finally calling these people out right it was a good thing
*  You take that attitude next to Biden you think Biden's gonna make anybody feel safe
*  No, man, I don't think so so the the argument I've put forward is look man
*  I'm a moderate person my politics have always been left-leaning pro-choice
*  progressive tax
*  Government programs all this good stuff group in a city, but I'm not super far-left
*  I need an argument from you Donald Trump has come forward with the economy was booming lowest unemployment in 50 years best numbers of
*  Our lives up until the pandemic
*  He instituted a travel ban that they the Democrats are even agreeing with not this point
*  If you want to convince me to vote for you and many people like me
*  I think you got to give me an argument as to why Biden is better, but they're not they're saying stay alive Joe Biden
*  We just don't like Trump, but they really they really they're really doing that
*  That's a good point
*  And I think if the economy does manage to show some signs of resurgence
*  Around November and in you know towards October and September if he has some sort of a real rock-solid
*  Plan and he can show you where it's going. This is what we're planning on doing
*  This is we're gonna have this by that and that by this and by the way Joe Biden is not gonna get better
*  His cognitive decline is going to increase and it couldn't it could drop right off of a fucking cliff
*  You might come around to where November is where the gaffes are constant and they pull him off of the public eye
*  And they never show him
*  If the Democrats want to win, they'll run Michelle Obama. We might have a fucking CGI Joe Biden with
*  I'm not kidding where he does it from some sort of a remote location and they CGI the shit out of his face
*  Well, I'll tell you one thing that there's there's some net positives Trump could look at in terms of the pandemic worry
*  You know people trust him his approval rating was going up when they were televising his
*  His his press briefings as soon as they stopped doing that his approval ratings started going back down
*  So when people hear what he was saying they liked it
*  but the other big factor is if this persists beyond the election Joe Biden will never debate him and
*  We see this in the press right now
*  Everyone keeps saying it the more the longer Joe Biden is hidden the better his campaign is doing because people can't see him struggling to speak
*  They're just going against Trump mail in voting. I agree with you about Michelle Obama
*  But I don't think she really wants to run well, I didn't I'm not sure she would either but I'm saying that's there
*  I think they would win if they ran her they probably would
*  Mail-in voting I think will be the downfall Republicans if if mail-in voting does get pushed through Nancy Pelosi
*  I believe she said she wants to have mail-in voting
*  Confirmed the next stimulus package if the lockdown persists beyond November November and mail-in voting is the go-to way
*  The challenge you see a bunch of Republicans saying that mail-in voting could lead to fraud and it can right if somebody's mom is like
*  You know old and just like not paying attention and you fill it out for her
*  but the bigger issue I see for Republicans is that
*  uninitiated and uninterested people will be voted for and that means in big urban areas
*  You'll have a mom and a dad telling their kids who normally don't care to vote. Just fill it out
*  Just fill it out. Just vote for the guy and
*  That could potentially hurt. I think the real concern is in the counting
*  That's the concern about in terms of fraud, right fraud is so
*  The Republicans main concern is fraud that someone's gonna take their kids pack and just fill it out for him, right?
*  But I don't know not just that also in how that how it's counted right tracking them
*  They all go to mailbox and the post office all mess. I agree with all that
*  You know, I think I think you don't need to go so far as to assume someone's going to snatch up all the ballots
*  It's possible and replace them. I think that's a bit too much for me
*  I just think right now we know the youth vote swings left and they don't care about voting
*  You put the ballot in their house. They care about voting. They don't they didn't turn out for Bernie
*  They did not turn out they turned out in some areas, but they didn't turn out
*  So you get this very active base online ranting about what they want
*  They don't actually go out for it put the belt in their pocket send it to their mailbox and their mom says there it is
*  Fill it out
*  They're gonna do it and so that's gonna make sure the people who normally aren't bothered to go vote will go vote
*  Tim pool, we just did three hours. That was not it's always fun. Thanks for taking the trip
*  Thanks for driving over here in your bug-out van. It's good fun. How long you stay this part of the country probably right away
*  Okay. Yeah, good luck coming in. Yeah, and maybe people wave to you along the way
*  Yeah, you have photos of the van the outside where people could see it on Instagram
*  I have one should probably hide that one delete that one ever man
*  Someone's gonna come to my van and kick it in. I don't know. That's not what I'm saying. They're just gonna
*  Chat to your face on their ass or something something weird people are weird man. I had a weird story
*  I have to bummer we didn't get to it. Go ahead do it. I had a crazy guy show up in my house. Oh
*  Pedophile four in the morning wanted me to tell a story. I had to call the cops
*  Wanted you to tell him a story wanted me to tell the world his story about being a pedophile
*  I saw him like that about about how he was innocent. It wasn't true
*  So each she shows up my house at 4 a.m. Tried breaking in so I wake up at 4 a.m.
*  Do you have a gun either? I don't have a gun and so I
*  Call the police. This is crazy. Please showed up. They catch the guy. They frisk him. They tell him to go home
*  Cops come back tell me to buy a gun basically. Oh, it's not easy thing to do but get this that morning
*  I wake up. It's like 9 a.m. And I got woken up at like 4 a.m. By this
*  I think was like three something and so normally I do a segment first thing in the morning airs at 10 a.m
*  And so after dealing with all that I was like, I am NOT prepared
*  I'm just gonna tell people what happened and say don't come to my house in the middle of recording my segment guy comes back
*  So I checked my security camera and I see him there and I'm filming while it's happening
*  So I call the police and I'm like he's back and I recorded all of it and then the cops came and he took off
*  I guess
*  Yeah, I was gonna bring it up because we were talking about you know, the end of the world the apocalypse guns so
*  It's not easy to get a gun in New Jersey
*  The cops were like if we're me I'd open the door with a shotgun and I was like, yeah if I could get one in
*  Jersey, but you can you just have to wait ten days, right? No, you got to write an essay. I
*  Got to write an essay on why I need it
*  Yeah, and then you have to be accepted and then they have to approve the essay
*  Oh, and they said they said typically takes 30 days, but sometimes it can take up to a year
*  It's not supposed to take up to a year that kind of illegal
*  That's what I was told at the department, but they're like move to Arizona
*  We could just buy a gun in a grocery store West Virginia. So we're gonna go. Oh, I don't know man
*  I'm gonna leave I'm I'm gonna move out of Jersey
*  Yeah, for sure. So I'm in the Philly area because of this partly
*  Yeah, but also because I want to expand my business, you know
*  I look I do opinion commentary on news stories and now it's time to start hiring more people for for straight news and fact-checking
*  So there's been I have a fact-checking
*  Build-out that I've been working on how we're gonna rate other agencies
*  we're gonna do a hundred randomly sampled articles and we're gonna run them through the
*  SPJ and Reuters ethics codes. We're going to look for violations of the ethics codes. We're gonna apply them
*  So if BuzzFeed news runs a hundred stories and we find that 63 are have have some kind of violation of a code of ethics
*  We give them the score of you know
*  Mm-hmm
*  And then people can see how we rate these agencies and you can look at all the stories
*  You can look at exactly why we disagreed and we'll highlight where the violation occurred. That's a great idea
*  So I need a building so I can hire people to do it beautiful
*  Well, let me know when that gets up and running. We'll let everybody know and appreciate you man
*  I really appreciate your perspective. I appreciate you way the way you look at things and it was great to talk to you
*  I'm in for sure. Thank you. Bye
*  You
