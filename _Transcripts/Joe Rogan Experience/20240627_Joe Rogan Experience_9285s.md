# Joe Rogan Experience #2036 - Kurt Angle
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3.0s)]
*  We're up with the greatest pro wrestling fan in the history of the world, Tony Hinchcliffe, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8.0s)]
*  and the great and powerful Kurt Angle. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=14.0s)]
*  It's an honor, sir. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=16.0s)]
*  Thank you for being here, man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=17.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on, Joe. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=18.0s)]
*  Dude, I've been a fan of yours for a long time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=19.0s)]
*  What you did in the Olympics with a broken neck is just nothing short of insane. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=21.0s)]
*  How did you do that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=27.0s)]
*  I didn't have a choice. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=28.0s)]
*  I mean, what happened was I got thrown on my head in the first round of the Olympic trials. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=29.0s)]
*  Pull that microphone up close to you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=33.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=34.0s)]
*  What happened was I got thrown on my head the first round of the Olympic trials, and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=35.0s)]
*  I broke my neck and I didn't know it, so I kept wrestling. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=39.0s)]
*  My arms were numb and my neck was in excruciating pain, and I wrestled through the semis and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=42.0s)]
*  won, and then I had to go on to the finals and wrestle, and I won there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=47.0s)]
*  So I won the first round of the Olympic trials with my neck broken, and I was in a terrible [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=51.0s)]
*  situation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=55.0s)]
*  I went home the next day and I went to my doctor and he took an MRI of my neck. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=56.0s)]
*  He said, you have four broken vertebrae and two discs sticking directly to your spinal [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=61.0s)]
*  cord. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=66.0s)]
*  He said, you can't wrestle anymore. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=67.0s)]
*  You're done. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=68.0s)]
*  I was devastated, man. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=69.0s)]
*  I didn't know what to do. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=70.0s)]
*  I figured I'd better get a second opinion. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=72.0s)]
*  So I went to another doctor, and he said basically the same thing, but he said, when is the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=74.0s)]
*  next round of trials? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=79.0s)]
*  I said, six weeks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=80.0s)]
*  He said, you know what? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=81.0s)]
*  I might be able to get you ready by then. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=82.0s)]
*  I said, what's your plan? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=84.0s)]
*  He said, well, you're not going to be able to train much. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=85.0s)]
*  You're going to have to let your neck rest and heal for the next six weeks, and it won't [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=88.0s)]
*  be completely healed, but it'll be healed enough that you can still go. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=91.0s)]
*  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to have a doctor travel with you, and this doctor's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=94.0s)]
*  going to stick you with 12 shots of Novocaine in your neck five minutes before each one [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=98.0s)]
*  of your matches. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=102.0s)]
*  He said, therefore you won't feel the pain. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=103.0s)]
*  You'll forget your neck is broken and you'll wrestle more freely. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=105.0s)]
*  But he said, I'm warning you, an hour after your matches are over, you're going to be [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=108.0s)]
*  in excruciating pain from the abuse your neck takes during those matches. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=112.0s)]
*  And he said, are you OK with this? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=116.0s)]
*  And I said, yes, and it worked. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=118.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=119.0s)]
*  What a decision to make. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=122.0s)]
*  I didn't have a choice. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, there was no guarantee I was going to make the Olympic team in 2000 or 2004. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=124.0s)]
*  This is my one time. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=129.0s)]
*  This is my one shot. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=130.0s)]
*  Imagine those guys you beat, realizing a guy with a fucking broken neck just kicked my [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=131.0s)]
*  ass. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=137.0s)]
*  I never thought about that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=138.0s)]
*  Not only did he beat me, not only did he win, he won with a broken neck. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=140.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=146.0s)]
*  So I went to the Olympics and we did the same thing there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=147.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=150.0s)]
*  And I was able to get through it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=151.0s)]
*  That's when I retired. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=153.0s)]
*  And I retired for a few years and that was that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=154.0s)]
*  Did it heal up 100% or has it always been fucking with you since then? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=156.0s)]
*  I always had problems with it, especially my motor skills and my hands. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=160.0s)]
*  I broke my neck four more times in the WWE and it got worse and worse. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=168.0s)]
*  I mean, I have nerve damage in my neck. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=173.0s)]
*  I lost three inches in both arms of my, they atrophied because my neck was just so messed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=175.0s)]
*  up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=182.0s)]
*  And I've had five surgeries and none of them have really worked. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=183.0s)]
*  I'm going to end up having to have fusion, which will be down the line. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=187.0s)]
*  Have you done stem cells? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=190.0s)]
*  I tried. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=191.0s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=192.0s)]
*  It didn't do it? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=193.0s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=194.0s)]
*  South America. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=196.0s)]
*  I forget which country. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=198.0s)]
*  Columbia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=202.0s)]
*  Columbia. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=203.0s)]
*  Did you go to bioaccelerator? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=204.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=205.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=206.0s)]
*  A lot of athletes, a lot of fighters go down there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=207.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=208.0s)]
*  It didn't work for me. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=209.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=210.0s)]
*  Just so much damage, huh? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=211.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=212.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=213.0s)]
*  Just too much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=214.0s)]
*  I wonder if you just kept going. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=215.0s)]
*  So what's the extent of it now? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=216.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=219.0s)]
*  I can't feel my pinky fingers. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=221.0s)]
*  I have a lot of atrophy in my arms. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=224.0s)]
*  I don't have a lot of strength. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=225.0s)]
*  I can curl for like 20 pound dumbbells. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=227.0s)]
*  When I do triceps, I can only push the weights about 60 pounds forward. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=230.0s)]
*  It's just I don't have a lot of strength in my upper body. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=236.0s)]
*  And so the thing is, all right, if you look at my chest right here, you'll see there's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=239.0s)]
*  a dip here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=248.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=249.0s)]
*  That's from my neck. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=250.0s)]
*  That's a nerve that died. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=251.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=252.0s)]
*  I have this muscle in my chest. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=253.0s)]
*  I have a complete ripple through my chest. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=254.0s)]
*  It'll never come back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=257.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=258.0s)]
*  And I'm afraid it's going to happen again. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=259.0s)]
*  So I'm going to have to have fusion sooner than later because if I don't, the damage [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=260.0s)]
*  is going to get worse and worse. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=264.0s)]
*  And then my arms are going to end up just shrinking to nothing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=266.0s)]
*  Have you looked into replacement discs? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=269.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=271.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=272.0s)]
*  I just got an email from a doctor in New York. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=273.0s)]
*  And he told me he was doing it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=277.0s)]
*  And so I'm going to call him in this next couple of weeks to see if we can set up an [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=279.0s)]
*  appointment. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=285.0s)]
*  Al Jermain Sterling, the former UFC Bantamweight champion, he injured his neck really badly [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=286.0s)]
*  and then got fouled in a title fight. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=291.0s)]
*  Well, actually, it was very controversial because Pyotr Yan, the Russian cat who hit [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=294.0s)]
*  him with the knee to the head while he was down, lost his title that way. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=300.0s)]
*  So he lost his title because even though Al Jermain is a sensational fighter, everybody [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=304.0s)]
*  was giving him shit because he won the title because of that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=308.0s)]
*  So then he goes and gets a disc replaced in his neck, defends the title and dominates [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=311.0s)]
*  Pyotr Yan in the rematch, beats him in the rematch, and then goes on to defend the title [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=316.0s)]
*  a couple more times and then just lost it to Sugar Sean O'Malley. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=320.0s)]
*  But he's got an artificial disc in his neck. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=324.0s)]
*  It worked extremely well for him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=326.0s)]
*  Yeah, it worked. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=328.0s)]
*  And he's good. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=329.0s)]
*  He's good to go now. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=330.0s)]
*  I need to look into that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=331.0s)]
*  Titanium. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=332.0s)]
*  It's a titanium articulating disc. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=333.0s)]
*  So instead of fusing the disc, this titanium, see if you can find it online, Jamie, articulating [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=334.0s)]
*  titanium disc replacement for spinal vertebrae, cervical, I think. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=340.0s)]
*  So Eddie Bravo has one in his lower back too. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=346.0s)]
*  And they do lower backs too. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do lower backs. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=352.0s)]
*  And what they do is they, this is what it looks like. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=353.0s)]
*  So they, instead of fusing your discs, which the problem with fusing your vertebrae is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=356.0s)]
*  you no longer have any movement. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=362.0s)]
*  With this, it allows you to have movement. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=364.0s)]
*  And I think it lasts for a long fucking time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=366.0s)]
*  You know, it's crazy. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=370.0s)]
*  I had a doctor when I broke my neck the second time, he wanted me to do fusion. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=371.0s)]
*  And he told me that he's going to have to do three levels and then I'd have to retire. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=376.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that might not be an option. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=381.0s)]
*  It was the same doctor that Stone Cold Steve Austin had. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=383.0s)]
*  And Steve still has problems to this day with the fusion. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=386.0s)]
*  Everybody I know that had fusion has real problems. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=389.0s)]
*  Yeah, see, that's why I'm nervous about getting it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=392.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm glad I found this doctor in New York City that can do it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=394.0s)]
*  I didn't know it was like there was no, there was a doctor out there that could do that kind of stuff. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=398.0s)]
*  I'll connect you to Al Jermain. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=404.0s)]
*  We'll find out who he used. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=405.0s)]
*  But his results are excellent. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=407.0s)]
*  I mean, he went on to defend the title. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=409.0s)]
*  I mean, and you know, wrestling, he's a wrestler. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=411.0s)]
*  So like he got caught in neck cranks, guillotines, fought his way out of stuff with this artificial disc. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=414.0s)]
*  That's crazy that he's fighting with an artificial disc. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=419.0s)]
*  Fighting and winning. Fighting and winning against the best in the world. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=422.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah, incredible. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=426.0s)]
*  And it seems like that was a pretty quick turnover because that rematch, there wasn't too much space in between. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=427.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty quick. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=431.0s)]
*  I mean, I think he was back fighting within eight months. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=432.0s)]
*  You know what? I was told that when you have that done, you literally are out of the hospital [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=436.0s)]
*  and you're working out like three days later. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=442.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=444.0s)]
*  It's like it doesn't really rehabilitate you that much. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=445.0s)]
*  You're back to your normal life pretty quickly. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=448.0s)]
*  I think it might. I mean, I don't want to say I don't. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=450.0s)]
*  I'm obviously not a doctor. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=453.0s)]
*  I don't know if you knew that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=454.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=456.0s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=457.0s)]
*  It's I don't know what the best options are, but it's an option. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=458.0s)]
*  And I think it's probably a better option in some cases than fusion. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=461.0s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=465.0s)]
*  It's a lot of metal on their neck. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=466.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=467.0s)]
*  You lose your mobility. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=468.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=470.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen Yoel Romero run? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=471.0s)]
*  Yoel Romero got his neck fucked up in Cuba and they just fused the whole thing. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=473.0s)]
*  So his neck is like so when he runs, see if you can find a video of Yoel Romero running. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=479.0s)]
*  His shoulders are up high. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=485.0s)]
*  Watch it. See, look at him run. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=487.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=490.0s)]
*  So his neck doesn't move. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=491.0s)]
*  No mobility at all. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=492.0s)]
*  Zero mobility. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=494.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=495.0s)]
*  And one of the best athletes that's ever competed in the UFC with a fused neck. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=496.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=500.0s)]
*  He like there's no flexibility there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=501.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=503.0s)]
*  There's no movement. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=504.0s)]
*  There's no movement. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=505.0s)]
*  So the movement is all absorbed in the lower spine and, you know, obviously has giant traps and, you know, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=506.0s)]
*  Will that give him spinal damage down the road? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=511.0s)]
*  I mean, who knows? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=514.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=516.0s)]
*  You know, but, you know, he had this done quite a while ago. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=517.0s)]
*  This is when he was competing as an amateur wrestler. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=520.0s)]
*  Wow. That's incredible. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=523.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=524.0s)]
*  And went on and was one that I mean fought for the title a couple of times. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=525.0s)]
*  One of the best middleweights in the history of the UFC. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=529.0s)]
*  He was an animal and just couldn't move his neck. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=532.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=536.0s)]
*  You're fighting. You can't even turn your head. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=537.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=539.0s)]
*  The crazy thing is he could take a hell of a shot. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=540.0s)]
*  And I've always wondered if one of the reasons why he takes a hell of a shot is that his neck doesn't move. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=542.0s)]
*  It doesn't snap. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=547.0s)]
*  Like it doesn't whip. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=548.0s)]
*  Like when he gets hit. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=549.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=550.0s)]
*  You know, we've talked about this on the podcast so many times, but the just the physical abuse that wrestlers take both amateur wrestlers and then maybe even more so in the pro wrestling game. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=551.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=563.0s)]
*  You know what? I've been injured a lot in amateur wrestling a lot, but not nothing compares to pro wrestling. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=564.0s)]
*  I have been so beaten up there. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=571.0s)]
*  I barely was ever 100 percent healthy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=573.0s)]
*  I would tear a hamstring or a groin or whatever. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=575.0s)]
*  That'd be something small. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=579.0s)]
*  And, you know, it would rehabilitate me a little bit, but I was still able to work around it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=580.0s)]
*  You learn as a pro wrestler how to work around injuries. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=586.0s)]
*  I actually wrestled Brock Lester in WrestleMania 19, the main event, with my neck broken. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=589.0s)]
*  I had to have surgery the following day. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=594.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=597.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it's crazy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=598.0s)]
*  The pro wrestling is just ridiculous. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=601.0s)]
*  You wrestle. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=603.0s)]
*  You're on plywood. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=605.0s)]
*  There's a there's a there's a cloth above it, but it's literally hard like plywood. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=606.0s)]
*  You know, there's no spring under the ring or it's not a box spring or a bed. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=611.0s)]
*  It's plywood. That's what you bump on. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=616.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=618.0s)]
*  Why do they do it that way? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=619.0s)]
*  I don't know, because it makes the sound. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=620.0s)]
*  Yeah, it makes a loud sound. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=622.0s)]
*  That's why they don't care about the health of people. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=623.0s)]
*  They just care about the sound it makes. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=626.0s)]
*  When you're at one live, it doesn't really translate to TV as cool as it is live. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=628.0s)]
*  You hear that pop and they probably I think they have microphones underneath. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=633.0s)]
*  Oh, they have microphones that accelerate it through the speakers and like, boom, boom. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=636.0s)]
*  It's very, very exciting. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=641.0s)]
*  It's one of those things that's a thousand times better live. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=643.0s)]
*  Isn't there a way they can like put a layer of wood and a layer of wood and then the foam so the wood slams into the wood, but you feel the foam? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=646.0s)]
*  Well, if you do that, then they see your little feet pushing into the foam. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=655.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=659.0s)]
*  How do you get a run on it? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=660.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=661.0s)]
*  They're like, that's a bed. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=663.0s)]
*  I mean, not a foam like a bed. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=664.0s)]
*  I mean, a foam like a wrestling mat, like something. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=666.0s)]
*  That might work. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=669.0s)]
*  That's not a bad idea. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=670.0s)]
*  Better for the athletes. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=672.0s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=673.0s)]
*  You know, like a tumble track or something, like something that has some give to it. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=674.0s)]
*  Well, hopefully, W.O.E.'s listening. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=678.0s)]
*  Well, you have seen the W.W.E. together now. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=681.0s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=684.0s)]
*  Which is very interesting. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=685.0s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=686.0s)]
*  That's a gigantic corporation. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=687.0s)]
*  You think they're going to cross the road? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=688.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=690.0s)]
*  I think they're definitely going to cross promote. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=692.0s)]
*  What I'm interested to see is like, you know, obviously Brock was the most successful pro wrestler to ever compete in MMA. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=694.0s)]
*  And CM Punk tried it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=700.0s)]
*  I'm going to be interested to see how many other guys, Bobby Lashley did it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=702.0s)]
*  How many other guys are going to try it? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=705.0s)]
*  When I look at that partnership, I see a lot of fighters crossing over to wrestling. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=707.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=713.0s)]
*  But I don't see many wrestlers crossing over to fighting. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=714.0s)]
*  I mean, that's a completely different beast. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=716.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=718.0s)]
*  I don't think there are many wrestlers that could go in there and mix it up with those guys. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=719.0s)]
*  Well, that's what's so sensational about Brock. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=723.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=725.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=726.0s)]
*  He's adapted to everything in his life. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=727.0s)]
*  The kid is unbelievable. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=728.0s)]
*  For his size, he's 310 pounds. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=730.0s)]
*  He's the best athlete I've ever been in a ring with. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=732.0s)]
*  I mean, he's explosive. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=735.0s)]
*  He's quick. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=736.0s)]
*  He's fast. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=737.0s)]
*  He's strong as hell. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=738.0s)]
*  I actually, I did wrestle him one time for real. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=739.0s)]
*  And the thing was, what happened was when he came up from training from OVW, someone [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=743.0s)]
*  went up to him and asked him how he'd do against Kurt Angle. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=752.0s)]
*  He said, I'd kick his ass. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=755.0s)]
*  So, okay, they're starting to pot. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=757.0s)]
*  You know, they're getting shit rolling. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=759.0s)]
*  So the guy comes to me and says, hey, Brock said he could be in a wrestling match. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=761.0s)]
*  So I went up to Brock and I said, hey, let's get in the ring right now. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=765.0s)]
*  And he said, no, no, I have sandals on. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=769.0s)]
*  I said, let's take our shoes off. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=771.0s)]
*  I said, we'll go barefoot. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=772.0s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=773.0s)]
*  So I let it go for the week. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=774.0s)]
*  The following week, he was in the ring with Big Show and they were wrestling for real. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=776.0s)]
*  And Big Show was about 530 pounds at the time. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=780.0s)]
*  Brock was double legging him, picking him up and slamming him. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=782.0s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=785.0s)]
*  I don't know if I could beat this guy. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=787.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=789.0s)]
*  So Big Show was facing me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=790.0s)]
*  He was on the other side of Brock and Brock's back was to me. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=792.0s)]
*  And I said, Big Show, get out. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=794.0s)]
*  He gets out and I sneak up behind Brock and I tap him on his shoulder. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=796.0s)]
*  I go, it's time to go. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=798.0s)]
*  So we went and we went for about 15 minutes. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=800.0s)]
*  And, you know, the wrestlers tell you that I kicked his ass, that I dominated him. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=802.0s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=806.0s)]
*  I beat him, but I didn't beat him. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=807.0s)]
*  I took him down twice. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=809.0s)]
*  He didn't take me down at all. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=811.0s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't like a dominating performance. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=812.0s)]
*  I did beat him, but, you know, he's the real deal. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=815.0s)]
*  Oh, he's the real deal. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=819.0s)]
*  He really is. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=820.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=821.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=822.0s)]
*  I'm surprised he didn't train for the Olympics. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=823.0s)]
*  I really am. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=824.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=825.0s)]
*  I wonder how he would have done. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=826.0s)]
*  I think he would have medaled. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=827.0s)]
*  Wow, that would have been amazing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=828.0s)]
*  The athlete he is. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=830.0s)]
*  Oh, he's an insane athlete. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=831.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen his combine scores. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=832.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=834.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=835.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=836.0s)]
*  He was the final cut for the Minnesota Vikings. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=837.0s)]
*  And they wanted him to go to NFL Europe for a year because they had it back then. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=840.0s)]
*  And Brock said, I don't want to travel. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=844.0s)]
*  And he said, I'll just do UFC. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=846.0s)]
*  You know, he's switching sport after sport. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=848.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter to him. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=850.0s)]
*  He knows he's going to be good at anything he does. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=851.0s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=853.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=854.0s)]
*  You know, the video we've talked about this so many times, video of him doing that front [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=855.0s)]
*  flip and landing on his head. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=858.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=859.0s)]
*  That would have dozed me. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=860.0s)]
*  Yeah, WrestleMania 19. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=861.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=862.0s)]
*  That was with you. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=863.0s)]
*  That video, that would have probably killed most people on Earth. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=864.0s)]
*  I thought he broke his neck. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=867.0s)]
*  My neck was broken. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=868.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=869.0s)]
*  My neck was broken and Brock was supposed to win the title for me. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=870.0s)]
*  When he did this, I was like, oh, shit, I'm going to have to pin him. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=873.0s)]
*  Right on his head. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=878.0s)]
*  I mean, that is insane. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=879.0s)]
*  Right on his head, on plywood. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=880.0s)]
*  So I go and cover him and I'm like, please kick out. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=881.0s)]
*  Don't let me hold this title for another month. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=885.0s)]
*  And he kicks out. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=888.0s)]
*  And then I'm going to start talking to him here and I'm going to say, Brock, are you [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=891.0s)]
*  OK? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=894.0s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=895.0s)]
*  And I was like, Brock, are you OK? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=897.0s)]
*  He said, I think so. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=899.0s)]
*  And so I said, I'm going to pick you up. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=900.0s)]
*  I want you to give me the F5. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=903.0s)]
*  Can you do it? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=904.0s)]
*  He said, I think so. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=905.0s)]
*  Right here. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=906.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=907.0s)]
*  And you're grabbing his neck. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=908.0s)]
*  That's what's so crazy. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=909.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=910.0s)]
*  You're grabbing his neck. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=911.0s)]
*  And he just landed on it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=912.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=913.0s)]
*  He didn't hurt his neck at all. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=914.0s)]
*  He got a concussion. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=915.0s)]
*  He got a concussion. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=916.0s)]
*  He didn't hurt his neck. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=917.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=918.0s)]
*  He doesn't have a neck. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=919.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=920.0s)]
*  It's so crazy that he came back from that. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=921.0s)]
*  His neck might be bigger than mine. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=922.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=923.0s)]
*  So crazy that he came back from that. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=924.0s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=925.0s)]
*  I was relieved. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=926.0s)]
*  I got to drop the title and get my surgery the next day. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=927.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=928.0s)]
*  I was supposed to win. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=929.0s)]
*  That wasn't supposed to happen. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=930.0s)]
*  They wanted me to have a nice long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=931.0s)]
*  long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=934.0s)]
*  I broke my neck. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=938.0s)]
*  Brock broke my neck the month before in a wrestling match. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=939.0s)]
*  And so I had to, I went to the doctor. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=940.0s)]
*  He said, you have to have surgery. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=941.0s)]
*  So I just, I told Vince, I'm not going to wrestle WrestleMania and I wasn't going to [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=942.0s)]
*  do it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=943.0s)]
*  And I was going to have surgery right away. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=944.0s)]
*  And I went to my next door neighbors and this kid, he, he has Down syndrome, really nice [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=945.0s)]
*  kid. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=946.0s)]
*  His name's Johnny. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=947.0s)]
*  And he said, Kurt, I heard you mentioned that you were going to go to the gym. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=948.0s)]
*  And he said, I'm going to go to the gym. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=949.0s)]
*  And he said, I'm not going to do it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=950.0s)]
*  And I said, I'm not going to do it. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=951.0s)]
*  And I said, I'm not going to do it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=952.0s)]
*  And he said, I'm not going to do it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=953.0s)]
*  And I wasn't going to do it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=955.0s)]
*  And I was going to have surgery right away. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=957.0s)]
*  And I went to my next door neighbors and this kid, he, he has Down syndrome, really nice [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=959.0s)]
*  kid. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=964.0s)]
*  His name's Johnny. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=965.0s)]
*  And he said, Kurt, I heard you're not wrestling at WrestleMania. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=966.0s)]
*  And he gives me this magazine. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=969.0s)]
*  It's direct TV. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=970.0s)]
*  And I'm on the cover with Brock. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=971.0s)]
*  He said, I really wish you would be able to wrestle. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=972.0s)]
*  And I thought, you know what? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=975.0s)]
*  I'm going to wrestle to lose a title to Brock on SmackDown. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=976.0s)]
*  That's what Vince wanted me to do. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=980.0s)]
*  He wanted Brock to kick me in the gut, get me in that five and beat me. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=981.0s)]
*  I said, I might as well just go to WrestleMania and tough it out. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=984.0s)]
*  You know, go ahead and do it with a broken neck. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=987.0s)]
*  And, you know, is it going to make it worse? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=990.0s)]
*  If it does, it does. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=992.0s)]
*  But, you know, but back then there were no liabilities. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=993.0s)]
*  Now you can't do that stuff. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=996.0s)]
*  You know, there's no way that WWE is going to clear you to go out there with a broken [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=997.0s)]
*  neck and perform. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1001.0s)]
*  Did how did Brock break your neck the month before that? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1002.0s)]
*  He I was on his back. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1006.0s)]
*  I was adamant a choke hold. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1008.0s)]
*  I had him in a choke hold and I was on his back and he was on the other side of the ring. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1009.0s)]
*  He's really strong and he could run really fast. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1014.0s)]
*  So I'm on his back and he starts running to the other side of the ring and he goes to turn to so I hit the turnbuckle. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1017.0s)]
*  Well, we only turned sideways and my head whiplash really fast and it snapped. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1025.0s)]
*  I heard it snap and I couldn't feel my arm. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1030.0s)]
*  I couldn't raise my arm. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1033.0s)]
*  You could tell on the match when you watch it. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1034.0s)]
*  My arms down. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1037.0s)]
*  I couldn't raise it. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1038.0s)]
*  My neck was in pain. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1039.0s)]
*  I knew something was wrong. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1040.0s)]
*  And so I you know, the next day I went to the doctor and got the MRI and I broke my neck again. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1042.0s)]
*  And so I decided that I was going to have the surgery and then I actually put it off till after [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1048.0s)]
*  WrestleMania that had again. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1054.0s)]
*  But what's crazy is I broke my neck again. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1056.0s)]
*  Brock broke my neck again. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1058.0s)]
*  Six months later, he hit me over the head with a chair like this straight over Tom. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1060.0s)]
*  You're supposed to bring it sideways so you don't have the pressure of your neck, you know, your head going down your neck. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1065.0s)]
*  So he hit me straight over and broke my neck again. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1071.0s)]
*  I fiber vertebrae. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1073.0s)]
*  I cracked. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1075.0s)]
*  And so I was out again for about I had surgery again. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1076.0s)]
*  I was out for about three months. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1080.0s)]
*  I came back for WrestleMania and I broke my neck again. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1082.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1086.0s)]
*  OK, so I was rushing back before my neck was completely healed. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1087.0s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1091.0s)]
*  I broke my neck four times in two and a half years in WWE. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1092.0s)]
*  And what kind of surgery did they do? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1095.0s)]
*  A quick fix surgery. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1097.0s)]
*  It's called a lap and dectomy. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1099.0s)]
*  They go in. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1101.0s)]
*  They let the vertebrae heal. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1102.0s)]
*  That's why you wait a couple of months. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1103.0s)]
*  Let it heal. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1105.0s)]
*  But they go in and they cut the disc, whatever was blocking the nerves or whatever sticking to your spinal cord. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1106.0s)]
*  They cut out part of the disc and they leave the rest in there. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1111.0s)]
*  So right now I have like a little bit of disc in like three different levels of my neck. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1114.0s)]
*  And they're they're fusion together right now because I don't have enough disc. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1119.0s)]
*  And that's why I need to get this rubber disc docker. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1123.0s)]
*  Yeah, I really do. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1126.0s)]
*  Well, I'll connect you to Al Jame. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1127.0s)]
*  Please do. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1128.0s)]
*  As soon as we're done here. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1129.0s)]
*  I wish I'd known about it before. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1131.0s)]
*  It's such a dangerous area of your body to be injured. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1133.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1137.0s)]
*  It is. It controls everything. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1138.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1139.0s)]
*  You know, it's controls your legs, too. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1140.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1142.0s)]
*  When they do they think that so right now is it pushing against something right now? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1143.0s)]
*  Is that why you're getting the atrophy? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1148.0s)]
*  I have I have nerves that are being pinched and they're not being able to flow down my arms. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1150.0s)]
*  So that's my fingers are freezing cold. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1156.0s)]
*  They're always cold. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1159.0s)]
*  I don't have any circulation. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1160.0s)]
*  My arms. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1162.0s)]
*  I've lost. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1163.0s)]
*  Look, this shows you how much weight, how much muscle I lost. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1164.0s)]
*  This is all more thing. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1167.0s)]
*  This was all this is all extra skin because of where the size of my arms used to be. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1168.0s)]
*  And I'm just I'm barely making it right now. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1172.0s)]
*  I literally you know, my arms are 15 inches now. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1175.0s)]
*  They used to be 18, 19 inches. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1178.0s)]
*  So it's you know, I'm struggling right now. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1180.0s)]
*  It is the sheer volume that you guys have to do in terms of the amount of shows. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1185.0s)]
*  It's just such an insane workload on your body. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1191.0s)]
*  The punishment that you guys take. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1195.0s)]
*  The fact that you do like how many nights? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1197.0s)]
*  How many nights a year were you wrestling? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1199.0s)]
*  Well, we were probably going 260, 270. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1201.0s)]
*  I mean, there was a time in WWE where they were going 320. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1205.0s)]
*  It was ridiculous. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1210.0s)]
*  They were going seven days a week and doing nine shows. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1212.0s)]
*  So do five Monday through Friday. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1216.0s)]
*  And then they would do four in the weekend. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1218.0s)]
*  They do a double shot on the weekends. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1220.0s)]
*  That's how it was back in the 80s and 90s. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1222.0s)]
*  But then around 2000s when they changed it, they started having five shows a week. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1225.0s)]
*  So you had two days off. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1230.0s)]
*  Usually one day was a travel day. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1231.0s)]
*  So you really had one day off where you were home. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1233.0s)]
*  And on top of all that, at your level, those are longer matches. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1236.0s)]
*  You know, it's not even a normal thing. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1239.0s)]
*  You were doing the main events. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1242.0s)]
*  WrestleMania. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1243.0s)]
*  Like those are 35 minutes or an hour, 50 minutes or 40 minutes of putting on the biggest show. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1245.0s)]
*  I know there was a time where people were talking to you about competing in MMA. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1251.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1257.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1258.0s)]
*  I've got this story up wrong so many times. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1259.0s)]
*  Dana and I have been on the opposite ends of the spectrum with this thing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1262.0s)]
*  But now I think I got it right. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1266.0s)]
*  Like there were things I would leave out. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1268.0s)]
*  But Dana treated me really well. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1270.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie to you. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1273.0s)]
*  He offered me a couple of deals. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1274.0s)]
*  The thing is, the second time, the first time I won't even talk about it, the second time he wanted me to go on the show Ultimate Fighter with Kimbo Slice. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1277.0s)]
*  And I said, Dana, those guys don't get paid. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1288.0s)]
*  They're on that show for free. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1293.0s)]
*  I said, I need to get paid. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1295.0s)]
*  He said, well, I'll give you a substantial amount of money. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1296.0s)]
*  So he was going to pay me to be on the show. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1298.0s)]
*  But he said, if you win, you're going to get a six fight deal. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1301.0s)]
*  And if you lose, I'll probably still give you a six fight deal because I think you're going to be really good. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1303.0s)]
*  And he said, but I need you to take a physical. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1309.0s)]
*  I said, OK, let's take the physical. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1312.0s)]
*  Well, I took the physical and I didn't pass it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1313.0s)]
*  So I'm glad I didn't because my neck and all this stuff that I broke my neck five times up until this point when I went to see Dana and my I couldn't do five pushups. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1316.0s)]
*  And here I am. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1327.0s)]
*  I want to fight with these world class fighters. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1328.0s)]
*  And my neck is like so messed up. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1331.0s)]
*  My arms. I can't I can't do pushups. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1334.0s)]
*  I can't do anything. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1336.0s)]
*  And I would have got my butt handed to me. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1337.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't even I might have been I might have ended up getting paralyzed. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1340.0s)]
*  To be honest with you. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1343.0s)]
*  I was in no shape or condition to be able to compete with those guys. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1344.0s)]
*  And I was fooling myself. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1348.0s)]
*  And I'm glad I felt the physical because I probably would have went through with it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1350.0s)]
*  That's a different mentality. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1355.0s)]
*  That is a different mentality. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1358.0s)]
*  The men. I mean, you want to talk about toughness, the toughness of pro wrestlers, the mentality that you have to have to be able to do two hundred sixty plus nights a year. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1360.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1368.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1369.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say you're a badass. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1370.0s)]
*  I think you're well, you're a glutton for punishment. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1372.0s)]
*  You're abusing yourself. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1375.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1377.0s)]
*  You're not you're not beating up people. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1378.0s)]
*  You're beating yourself up. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1380.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1382.0s)]
*  But you can do it over and over. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1383.0s)]
*  That's just the fact that you knew you had a broken neck going into that match with Brock. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1385.0s)]
*  That's who the fuck does that? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1389.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1391.0s)]
*  When you look back on it now, is there anything you would have changed? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1395.0s)]
*  Well, throughout my career, was there anything that I would change? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1399.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1404.0s)]
*  Well, we'll get into this topic, I guess. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1405.0s)]
*  After I broke my neck the second time, the first time in WWE, I was introduced to painkillers. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1408.0s)]
*  And when I start taking them, I really liked it. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1414.0s)]
*  I mean, it it it masked the pain. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1419.0s)]
*  I couldn't feel the pain. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1422.0s)]
*  It kind of gave me an energetic feel. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1423.0s)]
*  Didn't make me feel nauseous like it does a lot of people. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1426.0s)]
*  And I started taking I was taking one every four to six hours, like I was told. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1429.0s)]
*  But after a while, you build a tolerance and one doesn't work anymore. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1433.0s)]
*  Then you have to take two and two led to four. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1436.0s)]
*  Was this Oxycontin? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1438.0s)]
*  This was extra strength Vicodin. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1440.0s)]
*  Oxycontins are a lot more powerful than Vicodin. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1442.0s)]
*  But I was taking 65 extra strength Vicodin a day. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1445.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1449.0s)]
*  That's how out of control I got. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1450.0s)]
*  And I was hiding it from the company. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1451.0s)]
*  And and I mean, it was I was in serious trouble. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1453.0s)]
*  And does that even make you high at that point? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1458.0s)]
*  Does it just keep you from going OK with withdrawals? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1460.0s)]
*  It kept me from going through withdrawals. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1463.0s)]
*  But there were times where I passed out. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1465.0s)]
*  I mean, the company knew some of my friends knew, you know, I'll give you an example. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1467.0s)]
*  I there was one point that this is how bad it got. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1474.0s)]
*  There was one point in my career where I my brother called me. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1479.0s)]
*  I was at a house show and untelivate show for WWE was the night before. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1486.0s)]
*  I was gonna have the biggest match of my career with Brock Lesnar the next day. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1490.0s)]
*  It was an Iron Man match on SmackDown. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1493.0s)]
*  And my brother calls me and says, Hey, your sister just got a heroin overdose. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1496.0s)]
*  And it it crushed me. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1502.0s)]
*  I mean, I was I was crying. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1505.0s)]
*  I was in such pain thinking about my sister, who was only 40 years old, dying from heroin overdose. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1508.0s)]
*  And the thing is, I wasn't able to talk to her because I told her eight months prior, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1514.0s)]
*  if she doesn't get clean, I'm going to I'm not going to talk to you. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1520.0s)]
*  So I didn't talk to her for eight months. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1524.0s)]
*  And then this happens. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1526.0s)]
*  And I was so here I am in the hotel room and I look at my pills. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1528.0s)]
*  I said, fuck it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1535.0s)]
*  I took 20 of them, threw them in my mouth, chewed them up and swallowed them. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1537.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1540.0s)]
*  I didn't wake up till five o'clock in the afternoon next day. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1541.0s)]
*  And I had the biggest match of my career. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1544.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1546.0s)]
*  So what time did you have to be to the arena? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1547.0s)]
*  And did you do it? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1549.0s)]
*  We had to be there at one, but I didn't get there till five thirty. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1550.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1552.0s)]
*  But yeah, I ended up doing it. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1553.0s)]
*  The WWE was trying to call me the whole time. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1555.0s)]
*  They were like they wanted to tell me that, hey, you can go home, plan a funeral for your sister. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1557.0s)]
*  You don't have to do this match. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1562.0s)]
*  But I kept thinking I know my sister would want me to. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1563.0s)]
*  And I knew that I wouldn't have to feel that pain of losing my sister, at least for that hour. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1568.0s)]
*  So I went ahead and did it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1574.0s)]
*  And it was actually one of my best performances of my career, which is kind of crazy. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1576.0s)]
*  But that was that was a really rough time. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1580.0s)]
*  The painkillers are the one thing that I do regret I did in the company. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1583.0s)]
*  I wish I was never introduced to them. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1587.0s)]
*  But do you think you had to take them? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1589.0s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like you were in such excruciating pain all the time. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1591.0s)]
*  There were times I needed to take them and there were times I didn't. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1595.0s)]
*  But I was so far deep into it that I had to. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1598.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not going to lie to you. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1602.0s)]
*  I would go to sleep at night. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1604.0s)]
*  I would have 15 pills sitting on the desk next to me for when I wake up because I knew I was going to have withdrawn when I got up. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1605.0s)]
*  I wake up sweating, shaking, and I grab those, throw them in my mouth, chew them up and swallow. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1612.0s)]
*  Fifteen at a time. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1617.0s)]
*  Fifteen at a time. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1618.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1619.0s)]
*  Most people 15 at a time will kill you. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1622.0s)]
*  Well, it didn't kill me. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1624.0s)]
*  I took 20 at one time when my sister died. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1626.0s)]
*  So I've been really lucky. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1629.0s)]
*  I've been blessed. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1631.0s)]
*  I honestly I don't think I should be here today. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1632.0s)]
*  How did you get off of them? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1634.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1636.0s)]
*  Well, what happened was I left the WWE because they wanted me to go to rehab. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1637.0s)]
*  I don't want to go. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1641.0s)]
*  So I ended up going to another company called Impact Wrestling. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1642.0s)]
*  And I got my painkiller problem under control there because I got I found a doctor that got me on MS. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1646.0s)]
*  Cotton. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1651.0s)]
*  There are two morphine pills. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1652.0s)]
*  They're very tiny, but they'll keep you from going through withdrawal. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1656.0s)]
*  So I would take one in the morning, one at night and no more painkillers. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1659.0s)]
*  They were painkillers because they were morphine, but they were high dose. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1663.0s)]
*  It was just two of them that I had to take. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1666.0s)]
*  Well, I started having anxiety about breaking my neck over and over again. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1668.0s)]
*  So they put me on Xanax. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1672.0s)]
*  So now I'm taking Xanax. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1674.0s)]
*  And then I switched to TNA Impact Wrestling and everybody drank there. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1675.0s)]
*  So I started drinking alcohol. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1680.0s)]
*  So I'm mixing having these cocktails and I'm so out of control that I'm driving from town to town drinking a 12 pack of beer. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1682.0s)]
*  And I got four DUIs in five years. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1692.0s)]
*  I lost my reputation, everything I worked for. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1695.0s)]
*  I was at the lowest point in my life. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1697.0s)]
*  And I remember calling my wife from jail after my fourth DUI and she said, listen, I can't do this anymore. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1699.0s)]
*  You either go to rehab or I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1705.0s)]
*  So I went to rehab because I didn't want to lose my wife and my kids. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1708.0s)]
*  And I was scared in rehab. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1711.0s)]
*  I literally thought I was so nervous. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1713.0s)]
*  First of all, the withdrawal was the worst experience I ever had. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1716.0s)]
*  I'll never go through that again because I'm never going to take another painkiller. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1719.0s)]
*  That was the worst thing I've ever done or drink another drop of alcohol. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1723.0s)]
*  That was the absolute worst thing I've ever been through. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1727.0s)]
*  And I forget what I was going to say though. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1730.0s)]
*  So with the rehab, how do they get you off of it? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1733.0s)]
*  They don't do it cold turkey, right? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1737.0s)]
*  They do. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1739.0s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1741.0s)]
*  I thought they were going to wean me off. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1742.0s)]
*  They put you in a room and let you sleep and they check on you every couple hours. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1744.0s)]
*  How many days? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1748.0s)]
*  About six days for me to go through the withdrawal symptoms. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1750.0s)]
*  It seemed like forever. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1753.0s)]
*  So six days, you just in a room by yourself, just thinking. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1755.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1759.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1760.0s)]
*  And you want to stay in there. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1761.0s)]
*  And they start forcing you out. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1763.0s)]
*  You've got to come move around. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1765.0s)]
*  You've got to come out and talk to people. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1766.0s)]
*  You've got to live your life. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1768.0s)]
*  And you're so exhausted for the first two and a half weeks. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1770.0s)]
*  I didn't want to move. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1774.0s)]
*  I just wanted to stay in my bed. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1775.0s)]
*  But they were forcing me to get out of bed and being conversed or conversating with people [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1777.0s)]
*  and trying to go and eat and go to meetings and do all that stuff you do in rehab. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1783.0s)]
*  So it was really tough. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1788.0s)]
*  How long did it take before you felt normal? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1790.0s)]
*  Well, I would say two weeks where I really felt normal. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1794.0s)]
*  But the thing is, the last two weeks, because I spent a month in rehab, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1798.0s)]
*  the last two weeks, I was so nervous that I was going to fuck up again. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1802.0s)]
*  Like, I literally didn't want to leave rehab. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1806.0s)]
*  I was scared that I was going to go back to it right when I got out. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1810.0s)]
*  So many guys do. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1813.0s)]
*  That's why. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1815.0s)]
*  Like, I hear all these stories. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1816.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, it's going to happen to you too, man. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1817.0s)]
*  And, you know, but the one thing that I kept going across in my mind was going through withdrawal. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1819.0s)]
*  I don't want to do that again. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1826.0s)]
*  And I know if I start taking them, I'm going to have to experience that again. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1828.0s)]
*  And I don't want to. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1832.0s)]
*  It was that bad? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1833.0s)]
*  It was that bad. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1834.0s)]
*  What is it like? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1835.0s)]
*  What does withdrawal feel like? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1836.0s)]
*  You're sweating because you're hot and you're cold at the same time. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1837.0s)]
*  You're shitting your pants. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1841.0s)]
*  You're throwing up. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1843.0s)]
*  You can't think straight. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1845.0s)]
*  Your body's shaking. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1847.0s)]
*  You're getting hot sweats, cold sweats. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1849.0s)]
*  Everything's, you feel like you don't have anything inside of you. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1852.0s)]
*  No insides, no organs, nothing. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1855.0s)]
*  You feel like you're hollow. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1857.0s)]
*  It's just the craziest thing. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1859.0s)]
*  It's the most painful thing I've ever gone through. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1860.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm sure people have been in a lot more pain than that with certain things they've had done to themselves. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1863.0s)]
*  But for me, that was the worst. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1869.0s)]
*  What's crazy is when you think about how mentally strong you are, how difficult it is for you to go through that. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1871.0s)]
*  Now, think of the average person. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1877.0s)]
*  You know, have you seen that painkiller show on Netflix? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1879.0s)]
*  I watched some of it. Yeah. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1882.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1884.0s)]
*  Fucking what they did to this country is so crazy. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1885.0s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1889.0s)]
*  They're advertising it. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1890.0s)]
*  Hey, this is the best drug since whatever. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1891.0s)]
*  And, you know, this will keep you, you know, keep you moving every day and give you a healthy lifestyle. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1893.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, they didn't tell you that they're opiates and they're addictive and that they could kill you. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1904.0s)]
*  The one to start and the one to stay with. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1905.0s)]
*  What was the slogan that they used, Jamie? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1907.0s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1909.0s)]
*  We talked to Peter Berg, who made that show. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1910.0s)]
*  And, you know, he had to obviously had to do a lot of research on the Sackler family and what they did and how they engineered this and how they knew that. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1913.0s)]
*  I mean, people weren't just taking painkillers back then. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1920.0s)]
*  It wasn't a normal thing. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1923.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1924.0s)]
*  You know, like when I was we talked about this when I was a kid for someone to take heroin was crazy. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1925.0s)]
*  We found out someone was taking heroin like, Jesus Christ, Mike's taking heroin. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1930.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1934.0s)]
*  But when those pills came around, because it was prescribed by a doctor, everybody's like, it's fine. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1935.0s)]
*  It's OK. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1941.0s)]
*  I thought it was too. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1942.0s)]
*  That, you know, this is legal. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1943.0s)]
*  My doctor's giving it to me. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1945.0s)]
*  This is what I need. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1946.0s)]
*  And but I knew, you know, after I started taking more than four and I was taking five, six, seven, eight, I knew I wasn't doing the right thing. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1947.0s)]
*  I knew that I was going against what the doctors wanted because you know what I would do? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1956.0s)]
*  I literally I had 12 doctors that I was calling. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1961.0s)]
*  Oh, so I and I had 12 different pharmacies because you can't go to the same pharmacy twice in one month. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1964.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1970.0s)]
*  OK. And I had a Mexican contact where I got them illegally. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1971.0s)]
*  So I was getting about twenty seven hundred pills a month. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1975.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1980.0s)]
*  That is that. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1981.0s)]
*  Oh, you know what? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1983.0s)]
*  That's all you think about. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1984.0s)]
*  That's all you think about is how you're going to get your drug the next time. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1985.0s)]
*  So I have this calendar and every day it tells me which doctor to contact or contact your Mexican contact down in Mexico. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1988.0s)]
*  So I have all these things set up so that I can get what I need. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=1996.0s)]
*  And it takes over your life. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2000.0s)]
*  You no longer live in your life. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2003.0s)]
*  Your marriage is you know, you're not worried about your marriage, your kids, your job, nothing. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2005.0s)]
*  You're just worried about how you're going to get the drugs. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2010.0s)]
*  God. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2012.0s)]
*  So crazy. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2017.0s)]
*  And it's so crazy that this didn't exist. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2018.0s)]
*  This didn't exist in America till what? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2021.0s)]
*  Couple decades ago when it started. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2024.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2026.0s)]
*  Now, who's the people that the Sackler family? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2027.0s)]
*  OK. They affiliate with Purdue or? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2030.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2032.0s)]
*  Purdue Pharma. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2033.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2034.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2035.0s)]
*  The store from the documentary sensational, the series on Netflix is sensational. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2036.0s)]
*  And it just it just shows how fucking evil, evil. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2040.0s)]
*  Well, I wonder if they actually knew the dangers that were involved when they first started. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2044.0s)]
*  It seems like they knew. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2050.0s)]
*  They did. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2051.0s)]
*  It seems that they knew a lot. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2052.0s)]
*  They absolutely knew it was addictive. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2053.0s)]
*  That's why the FDA wouldn't approve it. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2055.0s)]
*  And then they took this guy. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2057.0s)]
*  There was one guy from the FDA that approved it and this guy would not approve it. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2058.0s)]
*  He was like, this is heroin. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2063.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not going to approve this. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2064.0s)]
*  And then they took this guy and they took him to a fucking hotel and they had him in a hotel for two days. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2065.0s)]
*  I don't know what they did. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2070.0s)]
*  Like, no one knows what they did in this hotel for two days. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2072.0s)]
*  But after the two days, he came out and instead of saying it's non addictive for the first time ever, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2076.0s)]
*  they said it is believed to to not be addictive. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2084.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2089.0s)]
*  What is like somebody said it like somebody believes it. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2090.0s)]
*  Do you believe it? Yeah, I don't think it's addictive. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2093.0s)]
*  OK, it's believed to not be addictive. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2095.0s)]
*  I mean, to use that sort of terminology, you just need one person. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2097.0s)]
*  Yeah, someone. Yeah. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2100.0s)]
*  Just approval from one person for one of the most dangerous drugs this country's ever experienced. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2101.0s)]
*  It is the most dangerous. Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2106.0s)]
*  Yeah. Look at the amount of people that have died from it. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2108.0s)]
*  I mean, somewhere the opiate overdoses in America are somewhere in the neighborhood of one hundred thousand a year, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2110.0s)]
*  which is so crazy. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2116.0s)]
*  So in 10 years, a million people die from this stuff. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2117.0s)]
*  And who knows how many people committed suicide? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2120.0s)]
*  How many people died from car accidents? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2123.0s)]
*  How many lives and families who were wrecked? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2125.0s)]
*  Yeah, that would the painkillers be an affiliate with that too. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2127.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. Yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2130.0s)]
*  So so many. And it's just it's just it's just insane. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2131.0s)]
*  It's insane how much power money has and that a pharmaceutical company could influence people in that way. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2136.0s)]
*  And in this documentary, they show the docu series or they show how they did it. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2144.0s)]
*  And it's scary because a lot of those doctors, you know, when they're younger or whatever, they're like, I want to help people. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2149.0s)]
*  I want to make people feel better. I want to I want to help humans. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2153.0s)]
*  And then they're in the business a little bit and they realize, well, if you want a vacation or if you want a yacht, you want to this. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2157.0s)]
*  You got to play the game. Yeah. Also, you have liability insurance. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2164.0s)]
*  You also have medical bill medical school bills. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2167.0s)]
*  You have, you know, the cost of running your business. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2170.0s)]
*  It becomes like every it becomes like the stock market. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2173.0s)]
*  It becomes like anything else where you're just thinking about numbers. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2176.0s)]
*  You're not thinking about people. It's not your responsibility. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2178.0s)]
*  And the crazy thing is then they would shame the people when they would when there's there was a strategy they had to say, oh, you're a drug addict. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2181.0s)]
*  It's not the pills on a problem. You're a drug addict. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2191.0s)]
*  You're an addict. And the people are, oh, I'm a drug addict. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2194.0s)]
*  Like, no, they turn you into one. Everybody's a drug addict. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2198.0s)]
*  You give them 20 fucking pills a day. They all become drug every human being. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2201.0s)]
*  Every human being, if you give them Oxycontin all day, they will become that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2206.0s)]
*  Everybody has the ability to be addicted. Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2211.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I believe everyone. I think everyone. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2213.0s)]
*  I had a wisdom tooth taken out like a decade ago and this doctor was so nice. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2216.0s)]
*  He was like a cool, smart guy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2220.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm going to send you home with these 12 Vicodin or whatever they were. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2222.0s)]
*  And if you feel pain, take one or two of them. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2227.0s)]
*  You'll be great. And I started to feel pain like four or six hours after. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2230.0s)]
*  I remember it was the day that the WWE Network came out because I got it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2234.0s)]
*  I'm like, this will be fun to watch. Catch up on old stuff, which it was. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2238.0s)]
*  It was amazing when that debuted. But anyway, so I have that on. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2241.0s)]
*  Pain starts kicking in and I take a half of one, just a half. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2245.0s)]
*  And 20 minutes later, I just start sweating and smiling like a super villain. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2250.0s)]
*  I mean, I could not take the smile off of my face. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2256.0s)]
*  I was just in glory. And immediately I'm like, this is bad. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2260.0s)]
*  And even though I had never been happier, like my body was just it was like in it, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2266.0s)]
*  just an overall orgasm for the entire mind, body, all the way down to your toes. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2271.0s)]
*  Your fingertips are sweating with excitement. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2276.0s)]
*  And I went and I flushed those other whatever nine and a half or eleven and a half pills down the toilet. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2279.0s)]
*  I knew immediately I'm like, this is trouble. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2284.0s)]
*  I mean, even if I would have taken the whole one, I would have I probably would have been I could have changed my fucking entire life right then and there. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2289.0s)]
*  Yeah, I remember they weren't around when I got my first knee surgery. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2298.0s)]
*  But when I got my first knee surgery, when I was in the hospital, they had me on a morphine drip. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2302.0s)]
*  And I remember lying in that hospital bed feeling so good. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2306.0s)]
*  I was like, this is amazing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2309.0s)]
*  And I had a ACL reconstruction where they did the patellar tendon graft. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2312.0s)]
*  Right. So, you know, they cut your knee open, they take a slice of your patellar tendon, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2317.0s)]
*  and then they screw it in where your ACL used to be. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2321.0s)]
*  And then they have you on this constant motion machine while you're in the hospital. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2323.0s)]
*  So this thing is extending your knee and closing out. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2327.0s)]
*  And then you had a button and you hit the button and the morphine drips. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2330.0s)]
*  And I'm just lying in bed. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2333.0s)]
*  I should have been in agony. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2335.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2336.0s)]
*  There had to be a limitation to what you could. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2338.0s)]
*  Yeah, imagine. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2340.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2341.0s)]
*  I mean, we're talking 1993. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2342.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2344.0s)]
*  There might not have been. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2345.0s)]
*  That was my first one. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2348.0s)]
*  And my second one, my second knee surgery I got was in 2000. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2349.0s)]
*  My second ACL reconstruction I got was in 2003, I think, and maybe four. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2352.0s)]
*  And that time I didn't take anything. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2359.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm not taking shit because I don't like the way those things make me feel. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2361.0s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2366.0s)]
*  And I'm scared. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2367.0s)]
*  Well, I like it too much. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2369.0s)]
*  Well, I had friends in high school that were addicted to drugs. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2370.0s)]
*  So I would before I was 30 years old, all I did was drink. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2373.0s)]
*  I would occasionally have, you know, I'd smoke pot maybe like six times until I was like 30 years old. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2376.0s)]
*  And then when I had surgery, I was like, I just associated pain pills and that stuff with your life falling apart. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2381.0s)]
*  Luckily, because I know how good it was. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2390.0s)]
*  Peter Berg was talking about that. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2393.0s)]
*  He took one recreationally and he's like, this is amazing. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2394.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, my God, I can never do that again because it's fucking because it's just too good. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2398.0s)]
*  It's too good. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2403.0s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2404.0s)]
*  Too many people that get hooked on that stuff. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2405.0s)]
*  The problem is their life is shit because they've been a drug addict and then they get off of it. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2408.0s)]
*  And so they're super depressed because their life is terrible because they wrecked their life. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2413.0s)]
*  And the only thing that makes them feel good is the drugs. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2417.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2420.0s)]
*  And no one can tell you any different. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2421.0s)]
*  No one can fix you. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2423.0s)]
*  You got to kind of do it yourself. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2424.0s)]
*  Your family can tell you, you got to stop doing drugs. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2428.0s)]
*  And then you go buy someone. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2429.0s)]
*  It's all you. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2430.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2431.0s)]
*  And it's wild. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2432.0s)]
*  It only takes one charismatic, smart sounding, seeming doctor because I've always avoided drugs as well. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2433.0s)]
*  And and it was just one orthodontist. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2442.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, totally no problem whatsoever. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2447.0s)]
*  Just take one of these. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2449.0s)]
*  You're going to have to be dead. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2450.0s)]
*  You have no worries. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2452.0s)]
*  No problem. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2453.0s)]
*  I'll give them to you even if you're not in pain. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2454.0s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2456.0s)]
*  I had a nose operation, a deviated septum fix. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2457.0s)]
*  My doctor prescribed me two different kinds of painkillers. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2460.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not in pain. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2462.0s)]
*  And he's like, but you might be. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2464.0s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2466.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not feeling this. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2467.0s)]
*  He's pushing them on you. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2469.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was pushing them on me. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2470.0s)]
*  These guys want to be one of the 12 doctors on a list. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2472.0s)]
*  Well, if you get their kickback, if you're supposed to like those numbers, you got to keep those numbers coming in. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2475.0s)]
*  They'll come to you. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2480.0s)]
*  Hey, buddy. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2481.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2482.0s)]
*  So they they actually do get paid. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2483.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2485.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2486.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2487.0s)]
*  There's there's some sort of kickbacks and there's also bribes and the bribes are in the form of vacations. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2488.0s)]
*  And dinners and my wife's nerves, my wife's mother rather was a nurse. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2491.0s)]
*  And she would say that the pharmaceutical reps would come to the to the clinic, the hospital, and they would like, take everybody to dinner. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2496.0s)]
*  Come on, we're going to take you to dinner. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2504.0s)]
*  They take him out to nice steak dinners and everybody would eat whatever you want. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2511.0s)]
*  Nice bottle of wine. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2512.0s)]
*  And so like they were on the side of these pharmaceutical drug companies. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2513.0s)]
*  So when the patients would say, hey, what do you think about this stuff? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2516.0s)]
*  They were like, oh, you should take it. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2519.0s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2520.0s)]
*  It's very good. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2521.0s)]
*  It's a good company. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2522.0s)]
*  You know, so it's just you you build loyalty with these people. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2523.0s)]
*  You know, Brigham from Ways to Well, Brigham started off his career. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2526.0s)]
*  He's a good buddy of ours who now owns a stem cell clinic. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2530.0s)]
*  And now he's into wellness and prescribes peptides in the United States. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2533.0s)]
*  Yes, he's in he's in Austin. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2537.0s)]
*  And, you know, back then when he was a pharmaceutical drug rep, it was all about relationships with the people. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2539.0s)]
*  Like you would go to the kids games. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2547.0s)]
*  You would know all these people. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2550.0s)]
*  You would know all the doctors and nurses. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2552.0s)]
*  You had to be on a first name. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2554.0s)]
*  But you were their friend. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2556.0s)]
*  And so the more they liked you, the more likely they were to prescribe your drugs, the more they would give it out to people. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2557.0s)]
*  And they were building trust, building trust. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2563.0s)]
*  And in Painkiller, in the documentary, the Netflix series, they hire these really hot young girls that were the representatives that would go to the doctors and sell this stuff. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2566.0s)]
*  And bring the brochures and they had a little spiel that they would sell. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2576.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2580.0s)]
*  It's crazy what they did. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2581.0s)]
*  I mean, they they followed the law. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2582.0s)]
*  Look, if you want to be an evil sociopath, it's really that the way they did it was that's the way to do it. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2584.0s)]
*  And it's the most effective way to make a lot of money. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2589.0s)]
*  They made billions. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2591.0s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2593.0s)]
*  They didn't break the law, I guess. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2594.0s)]
*  Sort of kind of. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2595.0s)]
*  Kind of. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2597.0s)]
*  But what's interesting now is because of the Netflix series, they were going to sign some sort of a deal where they give six billion dollars and they were going to have immunity to prosecution. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2598.0s)]
*  And a judge looked at it after the series and went, hold on. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2608.0s)]
*  We're not signing off on this. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2611.0s)]
*  Like, we need to find out what the fuck is going on. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2613.0s)]
*  Like, what did you guys do? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2615.0s)]
*  Like, what did you do to the world? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2616.0s)]
*  What did you do to the country? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2618.0s)]
*  So they're looking for more, more money. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2619.0s)]
*  Well, they're not just looking for more money. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2621.0s)]
*  They're now talking about criminal prosecution. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2623.0s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2625.0s)]
*  I mean, it's like you would like people to be held responsible for it. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2627.0s)]
*  But unfortunately, they have so much money they can pay the lawmakers. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2631.0s)]
*  They can pay the Congress. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2635.0s)]
*  They can do anything. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2636.0s)]
*  It's very weird. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2637.0s)]
*  It's very weird that they allow them to. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2639.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's evil. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2641.0s)]
*  It's really evil. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2642.0s)]
*  They ruined the lives of untold millions of people. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2643.0s)]
*  I don't know if I could ever do something like that. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2646.0s)]
*  Of course you couldn't. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2648.0s)]
*  Of course you come up with something that I know people are going to get addicted to. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2649.0s)]
*  I think it's one of those things where you become accustomed to it because everyone like you is doing it and it becomes part of what you do. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2653.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's just people adapt to whatever environment they're in. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2662.0s)]
*  And if your environment is in getting pills to people, that's your job. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2667.0s)]
*  Your job is to get pills to people. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2671.0s)]
*  The pharmaceutical drug reps, they come to you. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2673.0s)]
*  I mean, that's all they're thinking of. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2675.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2677.0s)]

*  Your job is to do that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2681.0s)]
*  Your job is not to like help these people. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2682.0s)]
*  There was one doctor in the series that was like an ethical doctor that kicked the lady out of his clinic. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2684.0s)]
*  He's like, get the fuck out of here. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2689.0s)]
*  You're selling heroin. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2690.0s)]
*  It's an interesting scene because like there's that's rare because most doctors are rule followers. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2691.0s)]
*  You got to think most doctors, they go to college. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2697.0s)]
*  They get their medical degree. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2700.0s)]
*  They go to medical school. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2702.0s)]
*  They do the residency. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2703.0s)]
*  Everything is by the book. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2704.0s)]
*  You got to do what they say to do. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2705.0s)]
*  And then you're working for a hospital, which I this is how naive I was. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2708.0s)]
*  I didn't even know that most hospitals are privately owned. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2712.0s)]
*  Like I didn't know that there were for profit businesses to try to push medicine on people. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2716.0s)]
*  I thought they're just here to help you. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2720.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2722.0s)]
*  Like wouldn't that be the best thing? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2723.0s)]
*  Like if hospitals were just places where the doctors get paid well because they're really good at their job. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2724.0s)]
*  But what they're trying to do is make you better. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2728.0s)]
*  No, those hospitals are trying to make as much money as possible. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2730.0s)]
*  They want to keep you in as much as possible. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2733.0s)]
*  Prescribing as much medication as possible. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2735.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2737.0s)]
*  I'll give you an example of that. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2738.0s)]
*  It's not really drug related, but I went to the hospital. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2739.0s)]
*  I had pneumonia and they they accidentally gave me the hospital bill of everything that they used on me. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2742.0s)]
*  And all my like like if I had like a ginger ale diet ginger ale, there's a little six ounce. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2750.0s)]
*  Those little ones. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2758.0s)]
*  I had like 20 of them while I was there. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2759.0s)]
*  They were charging $12 for each one of those. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2762.0s)]
*  They had on the bill like the linen, what the linen costs and this and that. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2765.0s)]
*  Linen was $200. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2770.0s)]
*  Just the bed sheets like like they I saw all this stuff on this bill. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2772.0s)]
*  The bill ended up being for five days was $165,000. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2776.0s)]
*  How could you spend $165,000 just laying in a hospital bed? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2781.0s)]
*  You know, they're serving three meals a day. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2786.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2788.0s)]

*  It was crazy. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2863.0s)]
*  I mean, I didn't take me long to recover though. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2864.0s)]
*  Probably four or five months. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2866.0s)]

*  No painkillers. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2875.0s)]
*  Do you take CBD or anything like that? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2876.0s)]
*  I tried CBD. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2879.0s)]
*  It doesn't really work on me, but. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2880.0s)]
*  I think the volume of pain you're dealing with is probably. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2882.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2885.0s)]

*  No, no, I don't believe so. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2889.0s)]
*  Might be. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2891.0s)]
*  I mean, it might be bad for you. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2892.0s)]
*  As I look at a killcliff with CBD in it. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2893.0s)]
*  This is 25 milligrams. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2896.0s)]
*  This is nothing. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2899.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2900.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2905.0s)]
*  General discomfort and inflammation. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2906.0s)]
*  It's not for what you were dealing with. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2908.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2910.0s)]

*  Yeah, well, as soon as we get out of here, I'll contact Aljo. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2922.0s)]
*  And try to get that hooked up and find out. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2924.0s)]
*  Because his is amazing. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2926.0s)]
*  I mean, the fact that he was able to get that surgery. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2928.0s)]
*  I believe Chris Weidman got the same surgery. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2930.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's from the same doctor, but several guys in the UFC. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2932.0s)]
*  I've gotten that surgery. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2935.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2937.0s)]
*  John Cena had it too. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2938.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2939.0s)]
*  I believe. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2940.0s)]
*  But his was a rubber disc. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2941.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2942.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2943.0s)]
*  How long ago was this? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2944.0s)]
*  Probably seven or eight years ago. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2945.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2947.0s)]
*  He had neck surgery. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2948.0s)]
*  I believe he had a rubber disc put in his neck. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2949.0s)]
*  And I'm not so sure that's going to last as long as the other one that the doctor that does yours. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2958.0s)]
*  That's the scary things they'll tell you. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2959.0s)]
*  Like we'll replace something, whether it's a hip or whatever. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2961.0s)]
*  But in 20 years, you're going to need a new one. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2964.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2966.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2967.0s)]
*  They told me to take care of your knees because they won't last forever. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2968.0s)]
*  What did they give you like a timeline? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2970.0s)]
*  15, 20. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2972.0s)]
*  But I told them, can I run on them? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2973.0s)]
*  And they said no. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2975.0s)]
*  But I run on them. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2976.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2977.0s)]
*  Kurt. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2978.0s)]
*  You do a lot of cardio to make up for all the stuff that you can't do? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2979.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2986.0s)]
*  I run. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2989.0s)]
*  I only run two miles, two or three days a week because of my knees. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2990.0s)]
*  I don't want to overdo it because I know they'll probably go to shit in a year or two if I abuse them too much. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=2994.0s)]
*  So I do very little. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3000.0s)]
*  I run a couple of miles three days a week. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3002.0s)]
*  Not a lot. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3004.0s)]
*  You know, as bad as the pharmaceutical drug companies are in pushing painkillers, thank God, the medical, like the technological side of it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3005.0s)]
*  The medical community is developing these incredible replacements. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3014.0s)]
*  That's crazy, huh? [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3018.0s)]
*  Getting new knees, new shoulders. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3019.0s)]
*  Like Matt Serra, who's UFC welterweight champion, he's just got his knee replaced. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3021.0s)]
*  He's back to jiu-jitsu, training hard. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3025.0s)]
*  He's going to get his other one done. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3027.0s)]
*  It's kind of incredible. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3029.0s)]
*  Now will he compete again? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3030.0s)]
*  No, he's not competing anymore. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3031.0s)]
*  But he's 50, you know, close to it at least. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3033.0s)]
*  You know, what he's doing is just training and doing normal stuff. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3035.0s)]
*  At least he can do what he was doing before. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3038.0s)]
*  Yeah, at least he can do what he was doing before. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3040.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of guys that they do some pretty high level athletics with knee replacements, which is pretty crazy. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3042.0s)]
*  Does it hurt? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3049.0s)]
*  Like, what do the knees feel like? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3050.0s)]
*  No, but you know what? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3052.0s)]
*  They're kind of, they only bend. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3053.0s)]
*  You can't go sideways with them. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3056.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3058.0s)]
*  It's almost like it's like done like this. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3059.0s)]
*  It's like a hinge. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3062.0s)]
*  So it doesn't twist. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3063.0s)]
*  So yeah, you can't really do. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3065.0s)]
*  You can't cut left and right. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3066.0s)]
*  No, not real well. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3067.0s)]
*  Not real well. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3068.0s)]
*  But yeah, it's kind of like this. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3069.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's insane because, you know, like the different we've all the wrestlers that we've had on all unbelievable athletes. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3070.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3079.0s)]
*  But the Undertaker, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, especially mostly known for their big characters, the entertainment side of things. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3080.0s)]
*  And Kurt's also known for that. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3089.0s)]
*  But really, Kurt is considered, I mean, Triple H, John Cena, the big guy. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3091.0s)]
*  They've all said that he is the best athlete in the history of the sport. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3096.0s)]
*  So compared to the people that we've had on, you've done more like you're he was throwing people more and landing on his head more and doing longer matches at the peak of it all. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3101.0s)]
*  And so it's wild to hear, you know, a lot of them have had replacements and this and that. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3114.0s)]
*  But it's almost a miracle that that's all that you've had. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3121.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3124.0s)]
*  You know what, especially with everything that I've gone through, it is really brutal. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3125.0s)]
*  I probably I did I wrestled pro wrestling. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3130.0s)]
*  I think it was 19 years and I did amateur for about 22. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3134.0s)]
*  And so, I mean, both of them have affected me. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3139.0s)]
*  I'm not going to lie to you. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3144.0s)]
*  And, you know, I had probably eight knee injuries and four surgeries in college and high school. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3145.0s)]
*  So mostly meniscus stuff. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3150.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had I had one was a ACL, but most of it was meniscus. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3152.0s)]
*  I also blew out my PCL and I never had it replaced. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3159.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3163.0s)]
*  Still like it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3164.0s)]
*  That's well, now they gave me a knee replacement. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3165.0s)]
*  Doesn't really matter. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3167.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3168.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3169.0s)]
*  But I had my my knee, my I could shift my leg like three inches back. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3171.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3176.0s)]
*  It was it was really loose because my PCL wasn't there anymore. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3177.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3181.0s)]
*  And you were wrestling with that. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3182.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3184.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3185.0s)]
*  See that everyone wants to complain. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3186.0s)]
*  Forty hours a week, such a long week. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3188.0s)]
*  I'm so tired. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3191.0s)]
*  Like this levels, this level levels to the level of the level of the level of the level [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3193.0s)]
*  levels to what people have to tolerate in this life, what they have to endure. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3199.0s)]
*  But I guess going through all that, you could probably go through basically anything. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3204.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3208.0s)]
*  Bring it on. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3210.0s)]
*  I've gone through a lot of shit, man. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3213.0s)]
*  I have. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3215.0s)]
*  What are you doing these days to keep yourself occupied? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3216.0s)]
*  Well, I just finished a movie called I Will Be Done. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3219.0s)]
*  It's a really good independent movie. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3224.0s)]
*  And I have a movie that I'm going to be doing at the beginning of next year with Michael Tadros Jr. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3226.0s)]
*  Brandy Couture is going to be in it. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3232.0s)]
*  Oh, that's awesome. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3235.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3236.0s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to that. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3237.0s)]
*  So I've been doing some of that stuff. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3238.0s)]
*  I run a podcast, The Kurt Angle Show. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3240.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3244.0s)]
*  And I also own a supplement company. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3245.0s)]
*  I have a thing called a company called Physically Fit. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3247.0s)]
*  And we have a product called Smart Snacks. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3251.0s)]
*  They're little crispy protein bites. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3255.0s)]
*  They're a bunch of flavors, 11 different flavors. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3258.0s)]
*  They're really good high protein, low carbohydrate. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3262.0s)]
*  They're doing pretty well right now. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3264.0s)]
*  We're going into Walmart. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3267.0s)]
*  We're in the quick fill stores. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3270.0s)]
*  A bunch of grocery stores, a bunch of convenience stores. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3275.0s)]
*  So they're doing OK. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3279.0s)]
*  Do you got a website that people can go to to get that? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3281.0s)]
*  Yeah, physicallyfit.com. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3283.0s)]
*  Oh, how did you get that? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3285.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3289.0s)]
*  How did you get that? [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3290.0s)]
*  That's a fucking incredible URL. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3291.0s)]
*  It is. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3293.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3294.0s)]
*  That's what people, when they look, when they want to get in shape, the first thing they [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3295.0s)]
*  type up is how do I get physically fit? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3300.0s)]
*  And what are the first things that pops up? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3301.0s)]
*  It was clever on my co-owner's part to do that. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3302.0s)]
*  That's very clever. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3305.0s)]
*  So what are those? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3306.0s)]
*  Chickens? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3307.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3308.0s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3309.0s)]
*  Chicken snacks. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3310.0s)]
*  Chicken snacks. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3311.0s)]
*  Those are chicken protein. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3313.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3315.0s)]
*  They're made with chicken. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3316.0s)]
*  The ones, whey protein at the top, those are whey protein. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3317.0s)]
*  And I believe, I think they're whey protein. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3322.0s)]
*  They might be the organic plant protein. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3326.0s)]
*  Crispy protein bites. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3328.0s)]
*  So you sell all kinds of stuff. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3330.0s)]

*  They're all different. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3335.0s)]
*  One's chicken, one's plant, one's whey. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3336.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3338.0s)]

*  But that was a very impressive movie. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3470.0s)]
*  The fact that he, it's gotta be hard for a guy like that too. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3473.0s)]

*  And he is just the man. He started. I mean, he was already pounding vodka cranberries. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3751.14s)]
*  He's like, what do you want to drink? I'm like, I'll have what he's having. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3757.2200000000003s)]
*  I haven't had a vodka cranberry since I was like 17 years old. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3759.58s)]
*  And I swear to God, we went all day. We went from one thirty to he didn't leave me until like eight p.m. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3763.34s)]
*  He like knew his limit. He's like, I'm going to get back. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3770.7400000000002s)]
*  He didn't seem drunk at all. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3773.54s)]
*  You must have had 17. I think I think it's because he's drunk all the time. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3776.54s)]
*  That's what I think. And he's so nice to everybody. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3783.54s)]
*  There's a part of me when you're you know, I've been around so many big people for so long [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3786.7s)]
*  where I'm like, kind of if they're with me, I'm like kind of protective. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3791.26s)]
*  Like, come on, give them some air, this and that. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3794.26s)]
*  But he was just embracing everybody. So cool. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3796.46s)]
*  So nice. And everyone's everyone gravitates towards him. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3800.7799999999997s)]
*  Walk a walk, a flame. Rappers are like anybody. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3804.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Walk a walk, a flame. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3808.22s)]
*  One of the good, great rappers shows up. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3810.18s)]
*  He goes, yeah, Rick, I heard you were here. What's up? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3813.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's hang out. Like people find out where he is and gravitate towards them. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3815.4599999999996s)]
*  It is it's everything you hear about. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3819.7799999999997s)]
*  It's like being inside of a story. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3823.02s)]
*  It's hard to describe. He's a lot of fun. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3826.2999999999997s)]
*  He is a living legend. Flare. He is a real living legend. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3828.7s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. He lives a gimmick 24 7. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3831.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. And he says he's making more money now. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3833.7799999999997s)]
*  He is. He is. He's cannabis company than he ever made in pro wrestling. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3836.3799999999997s)]
*  You know what? He told me when he was in WCW, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3839.3799999999997s)]
*  he was only making six hundred a year, six hundred grand a year. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3842.5s)]
*  Wow. And it's because when WCW WCW bought out Crockett, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3847.4199999999996s)]
*  the promotion down in the south, when they bought it out, they bought out Rick's contract. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3853.22s)]
*  His contract was six hundred grand. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3858.8599999999997s)]
*  So the WCW kept it at that for the rest of Rick's career, which was bullshit. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3860.8599999999997s)]
*  Rick should have been getting paid four or five times that. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3866.18s)]
*  So, you know, he always had money, but he was running out [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3869.18s)]
*  because he wasn't making as much as people thought he was. Right. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3872.14s)]
*  And he was living that life. He lives the life he does. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3875.2999999999997s)]
*  Whatever came in, came out. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3877.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, he and a lot of these guys, they did the small circuit [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3880.8999999999996s)]
*  and then they came up and then they eventually got to the WWE or the WWF back then. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3886.46s)]
*  You went from the Olympics right into like the big time. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3892.66s)]
*  Did you do any small shows to prepare? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3898.94s)]
*  No. OK. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3901.94s)]
*  The crazy thing was I didn't even watch pro wrestling. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3904.34s)]
*  Wow. So I was relatively new. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3907.46s)]
*  When I called the WWE in 1998, they offered me a contract in 1996, right after the Olympics. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3910.82s)]
*  I went up, I met with Vince and he gave me a multimillion dollar deal [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3916.5s)]
*  and threw it on the desk and he said, hey, ten year deal, let's do it. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3919.7400000000002s)]
*  I said, can I go home and think about it? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3924.94s)]
*  So I went home and went to my agent and he grabbed the contract. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3926.78s)]
*  He threw it in the trash. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3930.5s)]
*  He was a former amateur wrestler, also an NFL football player, former NFL player. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3931.78s)]
*  His name's Rob Ruff, Ruff Sindrich. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3935.94s)]
*  So he said, you're not going to do that crap. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3938.14s)]
*  You're the real deal. I'll get you a better job. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3939.94s)]
*  So he gets me a job as a sportscaster in Pittsburgh for Fox. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3942.62s)]
*  And it was the worst experience of my life. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3946.34s)]
*  I mean, I was I was really bad. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3949.34s)]
*  And the thing is, it was a startup station, so I didn't get to rehearse. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3953.34s)]
*  So the first night on the air, here I am, I'm anchoring the sports [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3957.58s)]
*  and my teleprompter goes out and my scripts. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3962.06s)]
*  When I went into the studio, I ran to the producer [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3964.78s)]
*  and they all went up in the air and fell out of order. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3968.42s)]
*  So when I put them down, they were out of order. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3970.86s)]
*  So I'm looking at teleprompter, the producer says, just look at the teleprompter. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3972.9s)]
*  Don't look at anything else. Just read it. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3976.42s)]
*  And I go to read it and it goes black. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3978.7400000000002s)]
*  It goes out. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3980.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm just sitting there for like a minute. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3982.02s)]
*  And the producer says, Kurt, say something, say anything. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3983.7400000000002s)]
*  So I remember like the first story was Duke came basketball. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3987.1800000000003s)]
*  They played tonight. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3992.34s)]
*  Let's go to the highlights because I didn't know what else to say. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3993.3s)]
*  And so the next of the next sport, I was I had to guess what it was. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=3995.9s)]
*  And I guess it was baseball and it was actually football. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4000.98s)]
*  So the whole segment turned out to be a disaster. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4003.5s)]
*  That was my first night on the air. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4006.54s)]
*  And it didn't get didn't get any better. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4008.42s)]
*  So anyway, so I spent a year there. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4010.54s)]
*  So at the end of 1997, I started watching WWE [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4013.3399999999997s)]
*  and I fell in love with a character named Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4017.2999999999997s)]
*  He he was just kicking ass. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4020.66s)]
*  I mean, he was he, you know, he's flipping off his boss. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4023.14s)]
*  I thought he was the coolest thing in the world. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4026.22s)]
*  And so I decided to call it W.L.B. in early 1998. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4028.14s)]
*  And I said, is that contract still stand from 1996? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4032.46s)]
*  They said, no, but you can come up and try out. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4035.66s)]
*  So I went up and tried out after the first day. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4038.02s)]
*  I picked up on it pretty quickly. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4040.5s)]
*  So they gave me a contract and I trained for about seven months. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4041.9s)]
*  And they literally they they had me training. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4045.58s)]
*  The first three months was a week a month where I just went up to WWE. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4048.8599999999997s)]
*  I went into their studio and I would train with a couple of wrestlers. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4052.8199999999997s)]
*  And so I'd only do that one week a month for three months. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4057.6600000000003s)]
*  Then the following four months, they sent me to Memphis [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4061.6600000000003s)]
*  to a smaller territory down in Memphis. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4065.0600000000004s)]
*  And I worked there for four months where I did one TV a week for four months. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4067.5800000000004s)]
*  And then Vince brought me up on the TV. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4072.7000000000003s)]
*  I was only worked training for seven months. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4075.34s)]
*  I wasn't ready to be on TV. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4077.98s)]
*  And he wanted me to go on TV at that point in time. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4079.98s)]
*  So I was like, Vince, I you want me to kind of promo tonight? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4082.86s)]
*  I don't even know how to cut a promo. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4086.66s)]
*  I didn't learn that down in Memphis. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4088.46s)]
*  I barely I did one or two promos in Memphis and they were horrible. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4090.5s)]
*  And now Vince wants me to cut a promo for five minutes. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4095.06s)]
*  And he and he and he's going to tell me it. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4098.099999999999s)]
*  He's not going to write down. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4100.54s)]
*  He's going to tell me what it is. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4101.94s)]
*  And he wants me to go out there and do it. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4103.46s)]
*  I'm like, holy shit, there's no way. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4105.34s)]
*  So I said, OK, go tell me the promo. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4107.0599999999995s)]
*  So he starts talking. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4109.0199999999995s)]
*  And the whole time, I'm just thinking this is fucking long. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4110.26s)]
*  This is really fucking. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4113.3s)]
*  I'm not going to remember any of this. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4115.18s)]
*  So when he gets done, I said, Vince, I'm sorry, but I didn't hear a word. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4116.900000000001s)]
*  You said you have to repeat it again. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4119.740000000001s)]
*  He said, I'm going to tell you one more time and you got to go out there [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4123.22s)]
*  and do it either sink or swim. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4125.900000000001s)]
*  So I went out and I did about 80 percent right. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4128.18s)]
*  And he was like, I think I have somebody here. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4131.22s)]
*  I think it's a guy I can work with. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4133.900000000001s)]
*  So I was learning on the job and I was getting better and better every week. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4135.58s)]
*  And Vince continued to push me. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4139.26s)]
*  He I mean, within three months, I was at the main event level. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4141.22s)]
*  It was like, whoa, like, what's going on here? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4144.22s)]
*  Why am I getting, you know, why am I getting, you know, pushed so hard? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4146.66s)]
*  And he just wanted to create another start. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4150.5s)]

*  In Connecticut, which is absolute hell and expensive as shit. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4257.74s)]
*  Middle of nowhere. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4262.26s)]
*  And yeah, I somehow I came. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4263.62s)]
*  I remember it was so long ago, but I got this meeting with them. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4266.22s)]
*  Somebody wanted to talk with me. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4269.14s)]
*  They heard that I was a pro wrestling fan and I just destroyed at this meeting. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4270.3s)]
*  And I gave them a bunch of crazy ideas that I just had in the back of my head [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4274.22s)]
*  forever. Stuff for the Undertaker to do stuff for this stuff for that. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4279.06s)]
*  And I killed it at this meeting and they offered me a full time job. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4283.26s)]
*  But at the time, I was already three, four, five years in the standup comedy [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4287.1s)]
*  and working at the store. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4291.06s)]
*  I devoted everything to standup comedy. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4291.900000000001s)]
*  So there's no way I could go backwards, especially for like a job [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4295.26s)]
*  with a boss and bosses and word on the street like Patrice O'Neill, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4298.700000000001s)]
*  a great comedian, took the job. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4302.620000000001s)]
*  And famously, anybody who takes the job, they're like, it's hell. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4305.42s)]
*  It's fine. No, Patrice took that job. Oh, he was doing it. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4308.700000000001s)]
*  He was really in it. Oh, yeah. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4311.660000000001s)]
*  He went to Connecticut the whole deal. Well, they pay you so good. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4313.14s)]
*  It's like hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4316.7s)]
*  because they make so much money and the writers are so important [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4319.98s)]
*  because they're putting out so much content to three shows a week, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4322.74s)]
*  pay per views, all of these big, long, drawn out storylines like week after week. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4327.0599999999995s)]
*  And they write six, six months ahead of time. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4332.94s)]
*  And they rewrite the day of. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4335.46s)]
*  So it's a nightmare. Vince will go, I hate it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4337.86s)]
*  Change everything. The day of famously an hour before. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4340.78s)]
*  And as a real fan, it's happened many times. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4345.62s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4348.26s)]
*  And you hear these things and it's like, God, I, you know, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4349.54s)]
*  I would have been cool if it would have been cool. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4353.18s)]
*  And what I mean by that is like if I could do it during the day [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4356.26s)]
*  and then take a train to New York City and do stand up, that would have been fine. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4358.82s)]
*  But it's not that kind of job. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4362.58s)]
*  It's we need you in the office right now. Where are you? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4363.78s)]
*  That type of right. So you could have had a gig. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4366.26s)]
*  You would have to cancel your gig. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4368.06s)]
*  But yeah, Mcmahon fired him six times. Yeah. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4371.62s)]
*  This article I'm reading about. That's what they do. They fire you. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4375.74s)]

*  Patrice, because he had stand up gaze conflicting with his with his WWE stuff. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4379.14s)]
*  And they hired him back. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4382.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. So Stephanie incredulously fired him six times. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4384.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's hilarious. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4387.22s)]
*  I had no idea Patrice did that. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4388.7s)]
*  I never heard that story. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4391.06s)]
*  Yeah, I can't believe I haven't mentioned it. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4392.18s)]

*  I am a moron for not taking the job. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4421.14s)]
*  But it was a huge gamble that, thank God, paid off. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4423.46s)]

*  take the right supplements, wink, wink and just keep [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4901.259999999999s)]
*  make some trips to Mexico. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4906.54s)]
*  You keep that fucking trader rolling like the fucking Aerosmith song. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4910.0599999999995s)]
*  Trayton kept on rolling all night long. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4913.98s)]
*  Look at him there, squatting almost a thousand pounds. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4916.54s)]
*  Belt squat, thousand pounds and 76. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4919.46s)]
*  I mean, that's fucking bonkers. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4921.7s)]
*  That's bonkers. Good for him. Fuck. Yeah. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4923.38s)]
*  There's very few humans like that out there. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4926.46s)]
*  They just have that kind of drive. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4928.62s)]
*  I could tell you that. There's only one Vince. Yeah. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4930.02s)]
*  I've seen him at his best and his worst. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4933.46s)]
*  And that guy, he's unbelievable. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4935.78s)]
*  I mean, he is he's the hardest working [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4938.54s)]
*  and most dedicated person I've ever been been around. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4942.78s)]
*  Like he really is. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4946.18s)]
*  He sticks to his diet. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4947.82s)]
*  He works all day. He makes sure he gets his workout in. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4949.86s)]
*  Everything is like a line for him. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4953.42s)]
*  Everything has to go a certain way for Vince. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4955.42s)]
*  He has to have everything lined up just perfectly. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4957.38s)]
*  You know, he's just he's an animal. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4960.62s)]
*  He really is. He's an animal. Clearly. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4963.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's what he looks like. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4965.38s)]
*  You don't look like that when you're 76, unless you're a fucking complete psycho. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4967.179999999999s)]
*  And again, the creativity, like it never ends. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4971.82s)]
*  He puts out two, three hours of content every Monday for 30. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4973.98s)]
*  What is it? 35 years now or something? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4977.78s)]
*  30 something years. Yeah. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4980.179999999999s)]
*  Here's something to think about. 30 years. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4981.54s)]
*  He's two years younger than Biden. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4983.339999999999s)]
*  Wow. Wow. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4985.0199999999995s)]
*  Wow, man. That's a big difference. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4988.0199999999995s)]
*  Geez Louise. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4990.179999999999s)]
*  With everything, not just his body, but the mind, mental sharpness. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4992.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, mental sharpness. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4995.7s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that's just incredible. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4997.379999999999s)]
*  He's still sharp as a rock. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=4999.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, he really is. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5001.379999999999s)]
*  Crazy. Yeah. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5002.58s)]
*  I don't know. Rocks are sharp. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5003.86s)]
*  A jaded rock. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5005.86s)]
*  Like a Flintstone that they used to cut mammoth meat with. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5007.86s)]
*  Diamond, perhaps. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5011.7s)]
*  Yeah, something sharp. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5013.7s)]
*  Diamond's really not sharp. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5015.7s)]
*  They can be. Diamond drills. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5017.7s)]
*  Diamond drill bits. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5019.7s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they're just hard, really. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5021.7s)]
*  But yeah, I know what you're saying. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5023.7s)]
*  It's just that it's just extraordinary when you see someone who's such an outlier. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5025.7s)]
*  I mean, if you've got all the 78 year old guys on earth, that's number one. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5030.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, 100%. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5034.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5036.58s)]
*  Like, if you had to ask me, like, who's the fittest, most driven, on top of it, 78 year old guy? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5038.58s)]
*  Vince McMahon. 100%. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5044.58s)]
*  Who's competing with him? Who the fuck else? Who's out there? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5046.58s)]
*  You would have heard of him. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5050.58s)]
*  If there's another guy like that out there, you would have heard of him. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5052.58s)]
*  No, you're right. There's only one Vince. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5054.58s)]
*  I know that for sure. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5056.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5059.46s)]
*  What a maniac. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5061.46s)]
*  And with this new union, man, I mean, this is something that I've been talking about for a while, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5063.46s)]
*  is like the power of and how close the UFC and the WWE can be. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5067.46s)]
*  But yeah, it's mostly going to be, I picture it being a transfer from almost like a retirement party to go to the WWE. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5073.46s)]
*  I mean, imagine what Diaz Brothers or something like that could do in pro wrestling. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5081.46s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Connor McGregor, yeah, these guys. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5088.34s)]
*  But you know what, I just don't see, well, I guess there are guys, I'm just wondering if, I know that Dana and Vince, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5090.34s)]
*  they didn't, okay, their contracts have specifically that you can't go to WWE or WWE, you can't go to UFC. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5102.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5110.34s)]
*  Like, they're like going against each other when they shouldn't be. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5112.34s)]
*  Yeah, they're worried about AEW, WWE should be worried about them, not the UFC. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5117.22s)]
*  This merger, that's a part of the contract? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5119.22s)]
*  Or Bellator, you know, before the merger. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5121.22s)]
*  I don't know what's going on now. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5123.22s)]
*  But they were in their contracts, you couldn't cross over to UFC. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5125.22s)]
*  And UFC couldn't cross over to WWE. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5129.22s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5131.22s)]
*  That's what's crazy. And one's MMA and one's pro wrestling. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5133.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think Derrick Lewis. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5137.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5139.22s)]
*  Derrick Lewis, he's the number one heavyweight that I would say could transfer over to WWE. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5141.22s)]
*  And be a fucking huge star. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5146.1s)]
*  He's so funny. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5148.1s)]
*  He's entertaining. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5150.1s)]
*  Oh my God, he's entertaining. And he's legit. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5152.1s)]
*  You know, everybody would know, he's the most heavyweight knockouts in the history of the sport. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5154.1s)]
*  And he's funny. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5158.1s)]
*  He's funny, he's giant. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5160.1s)]
*  Funny is a big part of it, man. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5162.1s)]
*  It's a big part of it. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5164.1s)]
*  I'll tell you what, I think Conor McGregor could have done really well in it too. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5166.1s)]
*  He might still, but he's got so much money, it'll be hard. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5168.1s)]
*  When a guy's got a half a billion in the bank. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5172.1s)]
*  Very hard to get a guy like that fucking get slammed. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5174.9800000000005s)]
*  You're not getting him out of bed. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5176.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's what's really impressive about some of these guys that go over and do things in the WWE. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5178.9800000000005s)]
*  Like Floyd Mayweather went over there. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5186.9800000000005s)]
*  The Paul brothers, these guys are willing. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5188.9800000000005s)]
*  They're making money hand over fist and they're going over there. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5190.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, they're still willing to get out there and put it all on the line. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5192.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, the thing for the Pauls and for Logan Paul and for... [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5199.86s)]
*  It's really just Logan, right? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5205.86s)]
*  Does Jake do WWE? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5207.86s)]
*  Bad Bunny? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5209.86s)]
*  Well, yeah, but they can promote their own things as well. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5211.86s)]
*  So Logan Paul goes out there drinking a prime energy drink. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5213.86s)]
*  So Conor could conceivably go out there with a bottle of... [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5215.86s)]
*  Yeah, a proper 12. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5219.86s)]
*  I think he sold that too though. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5221.86s)]
*  But I mean, he's probably still part of the company, probably the stock or something. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5223.86s)]
*  I think so, pretty sure. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5228.74s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5230.74s)]
*  I think he got paid. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5232.74s)]
*  It's everywhere. I see it everywhere. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5236.74s)]
*  They got it in there. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5238.74s)]
*  I've never even tried it. Have you tried it? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5240.74s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5242.74s)]
*  How much did Conor McGregor sell? Proper number 12. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5244.74s)]
*  $600 million. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5246.74s)]
*  Cha-ching! [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5248.74s)]
*  Made $100 million from the Mayweather fight and just started rolling. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5250.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5254.74s)]
*  And he's, you know, 35. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5257.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5259.62s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5261.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5263.62s)]
*  I mean, if it wasn't for his leg snap, he's still in the prime of his career. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5265.62s)]
*  But that leg snap's a real problem. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5267.62s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5269.62s)]
*  He's not coming back from that, huh? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5271.62s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, if he does, he'll be the first. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5273.62s)]
*  And if anybody does, maybe he can do it. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5275.62s)]
*  If anybody can do it, maybe it's him. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5277.62s)]
*  Because he snapped his leg in the prime of his career. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5279.62s)]
*  Anderson was a little older, I believe. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5281.62s)]
*  He was 36 or 37 when he snapped his leg. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5283.62s)]
*  Chris Weidman was a little older. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5286.5s)]
*  It's a hard one to come back from. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5288.5s)]
*  Nobody really comes back from that one. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5290.5s)]
*  Not, I mean, it's just... [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5292.5s)]
*  Is it because you have to have metal put in there? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5294.5s)]
*  You do. You have to have plates. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5296.5s)]
*  And then it's also, you gotta think the difference is you're kicking. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5298.5s)]
*  You know, and you're taking kicks. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5300.5s)]
*  Like, guys are gonna kick you in that shin for sure. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5302.5s)]
*  They're gonna kick you in your calf. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5304.5s)]
*  They're gonna kiss you and everything. Yeah. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5306.5s)]
*  Nerve damage, all the above. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5308.5s)]
*  And you gotta think, when that leg snaps, it snaps like that. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5310.5s)]
*  It snaps like that. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5312.5s)]
*  And then you got all that broken bone that's damaging all that tissue inside of it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5315.38s)]
*  And I don't know the extent of how much damage was done. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5317.38s)]
*  But it's been two years. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5319.38s)]
*  Right? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5321.38s)]
*  Is it about two years now? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5323.38s)]
*  Since he last competed? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5325.38s)]
*  I believe it's about two years. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5327.38s)]
*  And there's all this talk about him and Michael Chandler fighting from the Ultimate Fight. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5329.38s)]
*  I know he's sparring. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5331.38s)]
*  I've seen footage of him sparring. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5333.38s)]
*  And he looks good. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5335.38s)]
*  He looks real good. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5337.38s)]
*  But he also looks awesome. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5339.38s)]
*  And I think he's gonna be a great fighter. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5341.38s)]
*  And he's gonna look saucer. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5344.26s)]
*  So there's that. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5346.26s)]
*  So you gotta get off that. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5348.26s)]
*  And then there's a six month period where [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5350.26s)]
*  USADA has to test him randomly. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5352.26s)]
*  Which I think is a mistake. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5354.26s)]
*  I really think they should do all that in house. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5356.26s)]
*  Because USADA does stuff like, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5358.26s)]
*  well they don't do it anymore, but they were doing stuff like [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5360.26s)]
*  waking guys up at 6.30 in the morning, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5362.26s)]
*  like the day of the weigh-ins and testing them. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5364.26s)]
*  It was fucking insane. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5366.26s)]
*  For world title fights. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5368.26s)]
*  Fucking insane. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5370.26s)]
*  I think that if anybody can do it, it's gonna be Connor. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5373.14s)]
*  If anybody is gonna come back from that and fight again, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5375.14s)]
*  it's gonna be Connor. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5377.14s)]
*  But it's that famous [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5379.14s)]
*  Marvin Hagler quote. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5381.14s)]
*  It's hard to get out of bed [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5383.14s)]
*  and run in the cold when you're sleeping in silk sheets. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5385.14s)]
*  When you're the champ [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5387.14s)]
*  and you're rich as fuck like he is. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5389.14s)]
*  You don't have to do nothing forever. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5391.14s)]
*  He's got generational wealth. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5393.14s)]
*  And yet, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5395.14s)]
*  here we are in this situation where [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5397.14s)]
*  he's still in the present. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5399.14s)]
*  He's still in the prime of his athletic career. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5402.02s)]
*  He lost that fight to Dustin Poirier, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5404.02s)]
*  but it was a great fight up until the moment his leg snaps. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5406.02s)]
*  You know what? He is a different breed, man. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5410.02s)]
*  He's a fucking savage. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5412.02s)]
*  He's a real savage. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5414.02s)]
*  I hope he comes back. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5416.02s)]
*  It would be an amazing story. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5418.02s)]
*  I would love to see someone actually come back from that injury. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5420.02s)]
*  Because so far, Weidman came back [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5422.02s)]
*  not taking anything away from Brad Tavares, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5424.02s)]
*  because Brad Tavares is a fucking beast. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5426.02s)]
*  He looked great in that fight. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5428.02s)]
*  But Weidman looked a step behind. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5430.900000000001s)]
*  You've got to think Weidman took two years off as well. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5432.900000000001s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5434.900000000001s)]
*  Taking two years off and then jumping right in the heap [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5436.900000000001s)]
*  with a top 15 guy. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5438.900000000001s)]
*  And a guy like Tavares is a real veteran, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5440.900000000001s)]
*  is real talented, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5442.900000000001s)]
*  and real driven too. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5444.900000000001s)]
*  Super disciplined, always in great shape, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5446.900000000001s)]
*  always fights well, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5448.900000000001s)]
*  and is a real good striker. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5450.900000000001s)]
*  And he was just chewing Weidman up. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5452.900000000001s)]
*  Weidman just couldn't get off. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5454.900000000001s)]
*  It's a bummer. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5456.900000000001s)]
*  It's a bummer because that fucking injury, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5459.78s)]
*  so many other injuries guys can come back from. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5461.78s)]
*  Soft tissue tears, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5463.78s)]
*  you get them fixed, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5465.78s)]
*  you come back. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5467.78s)]
*  That's a motherfucker. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5469.78s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5471.78s)]
*  You break your leg right in half. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5473.78s)]
*  Frank Muir came back from that. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5475.78s)]
*  Frank Muir got a motorcycle accident [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5477.78s)]
*  where he got t-boned by a guy [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5479.78s)]
*  who ran a red light. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5481.78s)]
*  And got sent flying. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5483.78s)]
*  I think they said he flew like 30 feet through the air. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5485.78s)]
*  And snapped his femur, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5488.66s)]
*  so his upper leg. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5490.66s)]
*  It took a long time before Frank was back again. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5492.66s)]
*  And arguably never really reached the same form that he had. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5496.66s)]
*  He still beat really good guys though after that. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5500.66s)]
*  He still beat really good guys. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5502.66s)]
*  Frank was still a real world class heavyweight. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5504.66s)]
*  After that break. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5506.66s)]
*  And he might be the only guy now that I think about [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5508.66s)]
*  that's ever come back like that. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5510.66s)]
*  But everybody, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5512.66s)]
*  I don't know the extent of that injury. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5514.66s)]
*  He had real problems with that leg though. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5517.54s)]
*  There was a real touch and go moment [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5519.54s)]
*  where they didn't know if he was going to make it. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5521.54s)]
*  You snap a femur. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5523.54s)]
*  That's that big bone. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5525.54s)]
*  There's some blood flow. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5527.54s)]
*  It's so thick. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5529.54s)]
*  Snap that thing, you know how hard it is to snap that? [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5531.54s)]
*  It's just like when you get in a car. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5533.54s)]
*  It's a different situation. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5535.54s)]
*  But that lower leg snap, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5537.54s)]
*  apparently it's just very difficult for it to fully heal. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5539.54s)]
*  It's not like an arm. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5541.54s)]
*  You break your arm, they put a pin in it, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5543.54s)]
*  I know a lot of guys who broke their forearms. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5546.42s)]
*  They went back and Paul Felder, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5548.42s)]
*  a lot of guys, they get their forearms snapped [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5550.42s)]
*  like blocking a kick and they get back in there. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5552.42s)]
*  There's a difference. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5554.42s)]
*  You walk on your legs. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5556.42s)]
*  You don't walk on your hands. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5558.42s)]
*  And that's the argument also for him not being in the usada pool. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5560.42s)]
*  Of course. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5564.42s)]
*  If anybody shouldn't be in the usada pool, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5566.42s)]
*  get them out of that. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5568.42s)]
*  Let them do everything he can to come back. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5570.42s)]
*  Especially in the prime of his athletic career. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5572.42s)]
*  And also, there's a real problem where they're stopping guys from taking things like BPC 157. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5575.3s)]
*  All that stuff does is let you heal. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5581.3s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5583.3s)]
*  It's just letting you heal. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5585.3s)]
*  So that's on the band list. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5587.3s)]
*  It is now. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5589.3s)]
*  I think they're trying to bring it back. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5591.3s)]
*  You ever use that? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5593.3s)]
*  No. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5595.3s)]
*  I use it. It's great. It's fantastic. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5597.3s)]
*  It's very good. Very good when you get injured. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5599.3s)]
*  You'd probably love it. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5601.3s)]
*  It's a peptide, essentially. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5604.18s)]
*  It's called Body Protection Peptide 157. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5606.18s)]
*  Body Protection Peptide Comptom. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5608.18s)]
*  It's a really good peptide for healing injuries. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5612.18s)]
*  A lot of people have very good success with it. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5614.18s)]
*  So a lot of people recover from injuries with it. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5616.18s)]
*  I can connect you with someone who can take care of that for you too. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5618.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5624.18s)]
*  I think athletes should be able to use everything they can. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5626.18s)]
*  Especially in a sport like MMA. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5628.18s)]
*  Everything they can. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5630.18s)]
*  The problem was they used to be able to do testosterone. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5633.06s)]
*  I think they should still. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5635.06s)]
*  I do too. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5637.06s)]
*  The thing is, with testosterone, you can take a guy who's an older athlete, who has an older mind, who thinks like a veteran. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5639.06s)]
*  They really understand the game. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5651.06s)]
*  Because a lot of those guys, by the time they get to that certain age, they think real well. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5653.06s)]
*  They understand the game better. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5657.06s)]
*  They're more mature. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5659.06s)]
*  They don't have testosterone in their bodies anymore. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5661.9400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5663.9400000000005s)]
*  Especially fighting. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5665.9400000000005s)]
*  With fighting, with football, with a lot of things. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5667.9400000000005s)]
*  Those knocks to the head. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5669.9400000000005s)]
*  There's a guy named Dr. Mark Gordon who's a friend of mine who specializes in traumatic brain injuries. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5671.9400000000005s)]
*  He says one of the real problems is you get damage to your pituitary gland. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5675.9400000000005s)]
*  So the damage to the pituitary gland from getting knocked in the head a bunch of times is your body just not producing testosterone anymore. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5679.9400000000005s)]
*  Or other hormones. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5685.9400000000005s)]
*  Your body is just like very deficient in hormones. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5687.9400000000005s)]
*  Which makes those guys depressed too. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5690.82s)]
*  So they're dealing with all that. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5692.82s)]
*  They're dealing with depression. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5694.82s)]
*  They're dealing with fatigue all the time. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5696.82s)]
*  But the problem is with fighters, you tell them they can take testosterone, some of them, they go VTOR'd out. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5698.82s)]
*  When VTOR was in his prime. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5706.82s)]
*  I still to this day think that TRT VTOR was one of the greatest fighters of all time. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5708.82s)]
*  When he was juiced to the tits, he would come out there like a fucking alien. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5714.82s)]
*  He was so confident too. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5719.7s)]
*  He was so juicy. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5721.7s)]
*  And so skilled. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5723.7s)]
*  It was a combination of those things. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5725.7s)]
*  So he's an older athlete. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5727.7s)]
*  So he had been fighting. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5729.7s)]
*  I was at the first UFC that VTOR fought at in UFC 12. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5731.7s)]
*  I was actually training at the same gym as him. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5733.7s)]
*  I was at Carlson Gracie. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5735.7s)]
*  Carlson Gracie's gym in Hollywood. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5737.7s)]
*  VTOR was 19 years old when he went over and he fought John Hess in Hawaii. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5739.7s)]
*  And everybody was like holy shit look at this guy. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5743.7s)]
*  We knew. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5745.7s)]
*  All the guys in the gym knew that VTOR was the future. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5748.58s)]
*  And then when he gets older, your body is slowing down. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5750.58s)]
*  And also he did a lot of stuff when he was younger too. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5754.58s)]
*  And that limits your natural production of testosterone. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5758.58s)]
*  So as soon as they start telling you, you've got to fight on the natch. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5760.58s)]
*  Everything is just slower. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5764.58s)]
*  You know what? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5768.58s)]
*  When you get older, you lose testosterone. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5770.58s)]
*  Now I'm on a program right now, my wellness doctor. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5772.58s)]
*  That I'm on the level of testosterone that I was when I was 30 years old. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5777.46s)]
*  So he only gives me a certain amount. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5781.46s)]
*  I take a half a cc of testosterone a week to keep my testosterone at the level that it should be. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5783.46s)]
*  I'm not going above and beyond and trying to abuse it. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5791.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5795.46s)]
*  So I take a half a shot of testosterone a week just to keep my testosterone at the right level. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5797.46s)]
*  Between 600 and 800 I think is what it is. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5801.46s)]
*  That's a good level. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5803.46s)]
*  I do the same. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5806.34s)]
*  And that allows you to function, your body functions like a young man. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5808.34s)]
*  I'm 56 years old. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5812.34s)]
*  I don't have any problems in terms of my body working well. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5814.34s)]
*  Yeah, me neither. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5816.34s)]
*  Except for my injuries. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5818.34s)]
*  Except for your injuries. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5820.34s)]
*  But other than that, it keeps your energy level. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5822.34s)]
*  It also helps your immune system. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5824.34s)]
*  A lot of people have it in their head that it's cheating. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5826.34s)]
*  They think about Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa and all that shit. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5828.34s)]
*  And getting busted. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5832.34s)]
*  There's a negative connotation in a lot of people's minds that testosterone placement is all you're doing steroids. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5835.22s)]
*  You're cheating. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5839.22s)]
*  But if you're intelligent about it and if you do a really good doctor and you get your blood work done and you don't abuse it, it's very good for you. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5841.22s)]
*  It is. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5847.22s)]
*  That's why I do it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5849.22s)]
*  Me as well. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5851.22s)]
*  And I condone anybody out there that's in their 40s or 50s that doesn't have a lot of energy and is wondering what's going on, go get tested. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5853.22s)]
*  It would be good if they did it with fighters if the UFC administered it. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5862.1s)]
*  You can't administer it on your own. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5868.1s)]
*  They have to randomly test you to make sure you're not fucking off and doing something crazy. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5870.1s)]
*  But this is the amount you get. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5874.1s)]
*  Let's make sure that your blood work stays within this very normal line. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5876.1s)]
*  That parameter. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5878.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5880.1s)]
*  So you're not cheating. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5882.1s)]
*  You're just maintaining. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5884.1s)]
*  That would be a good call. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5886.1s)]
*  But it's just hard to regulate. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5888.1s)]
*  They're in Russia, they're in Thailand, they're training. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5890.9800000000005s)]
*  You gotta send people over there to test them. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5892.9800000000005s)]
*  You see them over in Thailand. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5896.9800000000005s)]
*  They look like a human pit bull. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5898.9800000000005s)]
*  But the thing is if you're on that stuff like that, my god, you could train fucking three times a day. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5900.9800000000005s)]
*  If you really go crazy with the test, like Alistair Overing you in his prime, like that guy, he's my favorite example. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5906.9800000000005s)]
*  Alistair Overing when he fought Brock. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5916.9800000000005s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5919.86s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5921.86s)]
*  He was so juicy. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5923.86s)]
*  But he was so good too. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5925.86s)]
*  He was so skilled. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5927.86s)]
*  It wasn't just a guy on juice. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5929.86s)]
*  It was a guy on juice who was a K1 Grand Prix champion. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5931.86s)]
*  Who also won the Abu Dhabi truck. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5933.86s)]
*  Have you seen him now? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5935.86s)]
*  Alistair now is a vegan? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5937.86s)]
*  He lost 60 pounds of muscle? [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5939.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5941.86s)]
*  He looks like fucking Kurt Metzger. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5943.86s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5945.86s)]
*  See, you can find Alistair over him now. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5948.74s)]
*  He's lost so much weight. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5950.74s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5952.74s)]
*  And he only eats vegetables now. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5954.74s)]
*  No meat. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5956.74s)]
*  He's like meat is bad for you. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5958.74s)]
*  No it's not. Who are you talking to? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5960.74s)]
*  Let me get you some really good scientists that actually understand nutrition. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5962.74s)]
*  He's talking to some fucking kook in Holland who's got wooden beads around his neck. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5964.74s)]
*  Look at him now. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5966.74s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5968.74s)]
*  That's not the same person. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5970.74s)]
*  He's not the same person. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5972.74s)]
*  I think he's probably natural now. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5974.74s)]
*  Also maybe, look how famous. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5977.62s)]
*  I think you just kind of get tired of being a fucking assassin. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5979.62s)]
*  You just want to be a nice guy. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5981.62s)]
*  You're like I'm done. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5983.62s)]
*  I'm tired of braining people. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5985.62s)]
*  I mean, you know, Alistair was fucking kicking people in the face and knocking their teeth out for 30 fucking years. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5987.62s)]
*  He was a vicious fighter. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5989.62s)]
*  You've got to think, he's still competing up until recently. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5991.62s)]
*  He fought Chuck Liddell in Pride in like 2004 or something like that. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=5993.62s)]

*  This is 16 weeks ago. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6008.5s)]
*  It's around his birthday. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6010.5s)]
*  Well, he looks good there. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6012.5s)]
*  He's just not gigantic. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6014.5s)]
*  He looks lighter. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6016.5s)]
*  He's a lot lighter. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6018.5s)]
*  Now go to Alistair Overeem weighing in for the Brock Lesnar fight. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6020.5s)]

*  That's him right there. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6024.5s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6026.5s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6028.5s)]
*  I'm in awe. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6030.5s)]
*  Look at me behind him. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6032.5s)]
*  That's when he was at his prime. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6035.38s)]
*  He was a fucking destroyer. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6037.38s)]
*  I swear to God, if they never outlawed testosterone, here's what you're smashing people. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6039.38s)]
*  This is when I was in K1. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6041.38s)]
*  This is when I was in K1. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6043.38s)]
*  Bro, he was a fucking monster. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6045.38s)]
*  He was a monster. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6047.38s)]
*  Because he was huge. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6049.38s)]
*  He was powerful and fast, but he was also supremely skilled. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6051.38s)]
*  He was a real elite striker. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6053.38s)]
*  He was a real elite striker. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6055.38s)]
*  I'm just surprised anybody could beat him. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6057.38s)]
*  Well, you know, he put it on the line. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6059.38s)]
*  He fought everybody. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6061.38s)]
*  He was in his prime. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6064.26s)]
*  Knocked Badr Hari out. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6066.26s)]
*  And then Badr Hari knocked him out in the rematch. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6068.26s)]
*  Those guys got knocked out a lot. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6070.26s)]
*  And that's part of the problem. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6072.26s)]
*  If you look through Alistair's career, I don't know how many times Chuck knocked him out. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6074.26s)]
*  I don't know how many times he got knocked out. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6076.26s)]
*  Francis Nganu knocked him into veganism. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6078.26s)]
*  Bro, he sent him to the dark lands. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6084.26s)]
*  We were there for that one. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6086.26s)]
*  Sometimes it's different not on TV. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6088.26s)]
*  Sometimes it's different not on TV. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6090.26s)]
*  When you're there and you physically watch somebody's head go backwards. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6093.14s)]
*  And their soul leave their body. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6095.14s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6097.14s)]
*  Did you see that knockout? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6099.14s)]
*  No I didn't. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6101.14s)]
*  Find Francis Nganu knocks out Alistair Overeem. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6103.14s)]
*  And by the way, this is Alistair Overeem post-USADA. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6105.14s)]
*  This is a different Alistair. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6107.14s)]
*  This is Alistair natural. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6109.14s)]
*  Also natural after taking supplements for who knows how long. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6111.14s)]
*  He was still a big guy. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6113.14s)]
*  But look how small he is in comparison. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6115.14s)]
*  And Francis is a natural 265 plus. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6117.14s)]
*  And Francis is a natural 265 plus. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6119.14s)]
*  Francis has to cut weight to make 265. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6122.02s)]
*  Francis is fucking huge. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6124.02s)]
*  And also the absolute scariest fucking guy to ever compete in the heavyweight division. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6126.02s)]
*  Francis fucking scared everybody. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6128.02s)]
*  He is a badass. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6130.02s)]
*  Oh he's so good. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6132.02s)]
*  And his fucking knockout power is so ridiculous. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6134.02s)]
*  He's such a heavy striker. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6136.02s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6138.02s)]
*  Boom! [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6140.02s)]
*  Boom! [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6142.02s)]
*  Now did he ever fight John Jones? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6144.02s)]
*  No he didn't. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6146.02s)]
*  But he might still. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6148.02s)]
*  They've left that door open. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6150.900000000001s)]
*  Francis is actually coming in soon. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6152.900000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to talk to him about this. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6154.900000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6156.900000000001s)]
*  Look at this left hook. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6158.900000000001s)]
*  Boom! [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6160.900000000001s)]
*  I mean insane. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6162.900000000001s)]
*  His head snaps back to where he's looking at his heels. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6164.900000000001s)]
*  Look how far his head snaps back. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6166.900000000001s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6168.900000000001s)]
*  You ever been knocked out? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6170.900000000001s)]
*  Not out cold. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6172.900000000001s)]
*  I got TKO'd in my last kickboxing fight. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6174.900000000001s)]
*  But I've never been knocked out like that. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6176.900000000001s)]
*  It's got to be a scary situation when you wake up and come to. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6179.78s)]
*  There's one where I got knocked out. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6181.78s)]
*  Is this one right here? [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6183.78s)]
*  Yeah the table gave up too early. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6185.78s)]
*  My head hit the concrete floor. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6187.78s)]
*  Oh god. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6189.78s)]
*  My hands were behind my back. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6191.78s)]
*  I was on loopy street. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6193.78s)]
*  Look I started trying to get up. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6195.78s)]
*  And Hunter's going to pull me back down. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6197.78s)]
*  Like he wanted me to stay there. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6199.78s)]
*  He was snoring. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6201.78s)]
*  So what happened was. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6203.78s)]
*  Okay this has been fascinating. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6205.78s)]
*  This has been fast forwarded. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6208.66s)]
*  What happened was. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6210.66s)]
*  I was supposed to pretend to get knocked out. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6212.66s)]
*  That's why we did the thing on the table. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6214.66s)]
*  So it was supposed to be a pretend spot. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6216.66s)]
*  So I'd get taken to the back. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6218.66s)]
*  And then I was supposed to come back to finish the match. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6220.66s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6222.66s)]
*  You guys use regular tables. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6224.66s)]
*  Don't you think you should use a fucking wrestling table? [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6226.66s)]
*  Shouldn't someone design a table? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6228.66s)]
*  That can take the kind of fucking weight that you guys can. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6230.66s)]
*  You guys are like regular conference tables from Costco. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6234.66s)]
*  Just rolling in fucking regular tables. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6238.66s)]
*  Hey that's wrestling man. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6240.66s)]
*  They don't spare any expense. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6242.66s)]
*  So did you wake up and realize what was happening? [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6244.66s)]
*  Alright I don't remember any of it. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6246.66s)]
*  What happened was. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6248.66s)]
*  They wheeled me back. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6250.66s)]
*  And Rock and Triple H were out there still wrestling. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6252.66s)]
*  Because it was a triple threat match. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6254.66s)]
*  I was part of it. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6256.66s)]
*  And they wheeled me back. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6258.66s)]
*  And I'm back there. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6260.66s)]
*  And they're getting ready to do a live shot of me. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6262.66s)]
*  They're getting ready to do a live shot of me. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6264.66s)]
*  Where I was going to tell them. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6267.54s)]
*  Stephanie was going to say Kurt I want you to go out and help Triple H. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6269.54s)]
*  Do it for me. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6271.54s)]
*  And I was going to say alright I'll do it for you Steph. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6273.54s)]
*  So they told me to say it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6275.54s)]
*  And I forgot. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6277.54s)]
*  So I said what am I saying again? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6279.54s)]
*  And Stephanie said just say I'll do it for you. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6281.54s)]
*  I said what am I saying again? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6283.54s)]
*  I did this like 8 times. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6285.54s)]
*  And Vince is in the background. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6287.54s)]
*  He's like god damn it get him some smelling salts and get him out there. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6289.54s)]
*  So I end up going back out. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6291.54s)]
*  And I'm like I'm going to do it for you. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6293.54s)]
*  And I don't remember. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6296.42s)]
*  I don't remember any of it. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6298.42s)]
*  They carried me through the match. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6300.42s)]
*  And there were spots where I had the duck. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6302.42s)]
*  And they actually pulled my head down. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6304.42s)]
*  And you know it hit somebody else when I was supposed to duck. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6306.42s)]
*  Like I wasn't able to do it. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6308.42s)]
*  So they were. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6310.42s)]
*  I was out there just being a dead human being. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6312.42s)]
*  You know. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6314.42s)]
*  And they're like pulling me around. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6316.42s)]
*  And they're. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6318.42s)]
*  In pro wrestling you can still have a match. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6320.42s)]
*  Even if one person is incoherent. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6322.42s)]
*  So the other person carries that person. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6325.3s)]
*  And tells them to do whatever. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6327.3s)]
*  So they were telling me what to do. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6329.3s)]
*  During that match. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6331.3s)]
*  But I don't remember anything. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6333.3s)]
*  I ended up in the hospital that night. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6335.3s)]
*  And I came to and said what happened. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6337.3s)]
*  And they said oh god you don't remember anything. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6339.3s)]
*  And I said no I don't remember anything. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6341.3s)]
*  They should have probably taken you to the hospital immediately. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6343.3s)]
*  Which is what's crazy about pro wrestling. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6345.3s)]
*  Like no no no the show must go on. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6347.3s)]
*  Well listen that wouldn't happen now. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6349.3s)]
*  This was in like 2000. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6351.3s)]
*  It was a different time. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6354.18s)]
*  That's what's crazy is that they really didn't understand head trauma. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6356.18s)]
*  Until I mean really that movie Concussion. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6360.18s)]
*  When that movie came around. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6362.18s)]
*  Then people started looking at what's going on with football players. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6364.18s)]
*  And what's going on with boxers. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6366.18s)]
*  And they really started looking at it more differently. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6368.18s)]
*  You know what I'm wondering if you know. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6370.18s)]
*  They're starting to like. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6372.18s)]
*  Like pro wrestling has this. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6374.18s)]
*  What's it called? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6376.18s)]
*  Concussion roll. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6378.18s)]
*  Okay so. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6380.18s)]
*  If you had concussions. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6383.06s)]
*  They'll take care of it. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6385.06s)]
*  So what I'm saying is. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6387.06s)]
*  Don't you think UFC. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6389.06s)]
*  That a lot of their fighters are going to end up with some kind of brain damage. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6391.06s)]
*  100%. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6393.06s)]
*  And that there's going to be some liability that comes out. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6395.06s)]
*  Well I don't know if there's going to be some. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6397.06s)]
*  I'm just wondering if something like that is going to happen. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6399.06s)]
*  Because these guys don't use gloves. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6401.06s)]
*  They got the small ones. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6403.06s)]
*  And they're going to be like. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6405.06s)]
*  They're going to be like. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6407.06s)]
*  They're going to be like. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6409.06s)]
*  They got the small ones. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6411.9400000000005s)]
*  Well not only that you're getting kicked. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6413.9400000000005s)]
*  You're getting kicked in the head. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6415.9400000000005s)]
*  You're getting kicked in the knee. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6417.9400000000005s)]
*  You're getting slammed in your head. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6419.9400000000005s)]
*  You see all the damage that's done in boxing. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6421.9400000000005s)]
*  And I mean UFC is. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6423.9400000000005s)]
*  MMA is probably worse. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6425.9400000000005s)]
*  Think about when Leon Edwards knocked out Kamaru Usman. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6427.9400000000005s)]
*  Think about that kind of a strike. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6429.9400000000005s)]
*  You're getting head kicked by one of the greatest strikers to ever do with sport. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6431.9400000000005s)]
*  Might as well get hit in the head with a baseball bat. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6433.9400000000005s)]
*  A leg of an athlete like that. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6435.9400000000005s)]
*  Is just as hard as a wooden bat. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6437.9400000000005s)]
*  You're getting bone. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6440.82s)]
*  Shin bone right to your neck. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6442.82s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6444.82s)]
*  Who knows. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6446.82s)]
*  They do their best to mitigate some of that in training. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6448.82s)]
*  But some guys don't. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6450.82s)]
*  Some guys spar real hard in training. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6452.82s)]
*  It's part of the sport. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6454.82s)]
*  And they know it coming in. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6456.82s)]
*  There's no denying it. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6458.82s)]
*  You're literally in the brain damage business. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6460.82s)]
*  Here it goes. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6462.82s)]
*  Boom! [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6464.82s)]
*  And when you know how good Kamaru takes a shot. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6466.82s)]
*  To see Kamaru go out like that. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6469.7s)]
*  Now what kind of long term damage do you think that just occurred to that guy? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6471.7s)]
*  It's a real good question. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6473.7s)]
*  And it varies with everyone. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6475.7s)]
*  There's some guys that got knocked out a bunch of times and they're fine. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6477.7s)]
*  There's a thing called. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6479.7s)]
*  I think it's called APOE4. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6481.7s)]
*  There's like a gene expression. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6483.7s)]
*  That if you have that. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6485.7s)]
*  You're more susceptible to CTE. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6487.7s)]
*  Than other people. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6489.7s)]
*  And it's different. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6491.7s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that you're immune to it if you don't have it. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6493.7s)]
*  I mean you're immune to it. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6495.7s)]
*  You're getting kicked and punched. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6498.58s)]
*  And head butts. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6500.58s)]
*  Guys clash heads all the time. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6502.58s)]
*  It's a very very very hard sport. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6504.58s)]
*  And without doubt. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6506.58s)]
*  There's going to be guys who the rest of their lives are dealing with the consequences of that. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6508.58s)]
*  And we see it. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6510.58s)]
*  We see it with the older fighters. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6512.58s)]
*  Some of these guys are just in complete agony. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6514.58s)]
*  Like Don Fry. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6516.58s)]
*  Don the Predator Fry is a legend. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6518.58s)]
*  One of the greatest ever. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6520.58s)]
*  Don was in here. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6522.58s)]
*  He's hurt. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6524.58s)]
*  He's like everything is in pain. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6527.46s)]
*  He can't hardly move. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6529.46s)]
*  You talk about an old school fighter. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6531.46s)]
*  That guy was a bad ass. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6533.46s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6535.46s)]
*  He's a real old school man. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6537.46s)]
*  He's there at the beginning. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6539.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. The very very very early days. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6541.46s)]
*  Mark Coleman too. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6543.46s)]
*  Mark Coleman's got a celebrity boxing match. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6545.46s)]
*  In October against Montell Griffin. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6547.46s)]
*  Montell Griffin fought Roy Jones Jr. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6549.46s)]
*  Is that why Mark's been training? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6551.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6553.46s)]
*  Hammer House for life! [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6556.34s)]
*  If you watch his Instagram. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6558.34s)]
*  He was one of my opponents to make the Olympics. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6560.34s)]
*  Was he really? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6562.34s)]
*  Him and Mark Kerr. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6564.34s)]
*  They were bad asses. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6566.34s)]
*  Those two gave me the worst problems in 1993 and 94. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6568.34s)]
*  They're the ones that were beating me. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6570.34s)]
*  And then I ended up beating them in 95, 96. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6572.34s)]
*  But I went through. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6574.34s)]
*  If you saw my documentary. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6576.34s)]
*  It's about my training. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6578.34s)]
*  And what I did. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6580.34s)]
*  What I did was I went through a lot of training. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6582.34s)]
*  What I was doing was exhaust training. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6585.22s)]
*  That's when you train until you're exhausted. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6587.22s)]
*  And that's when the training actually begins. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6589.22s)]
*  It's almost a form of torture. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6591.22s)]
*  I learned it from the University of Iowa head wrestling coach. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6593.22s)]
*  Dan Gable. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6595.22s)]
*  He taught us wrestling. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6597.22s)]
*  It's about staying in someone's face. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6599.22s)]
*  And just keep going at it. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6601.22s)]
*  Never back off. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6603.22s)]
*  Just keep staying there. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6605.22s)]
*  And keep hand fighting. And keep attacking. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6607.22s)]
*  That's what I was doing. I was staying on my opponents. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6609.22s)]
*  And getting them tired. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6611.22s)]
*  And I was just doing what I was doing. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6614.1s)]
*  I was scoring. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6616.1s)]
*  And so I wasn't the biggest or the fastest or the strongest. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6618.1s)]
*  Or the most technical. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6620.1s)]
*  But what I knew I could be is the most well-conditioned. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6622.1s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6624.1s)]
*  This is Kerr. This is Mark Kerr. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6626.1s)]
*  This is Mark Kerr when he was a normal size. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6628.1s)]
*  Mark Kerr went on to fight. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6630.1s)]
*  In the UFC. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6632.1s)]
*  And went on to fight in Pride. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6634.1s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6636.1s)]
*  When he was the smashing machine. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6638.1s)]
*  That documentary is insane. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6640.1s)]
*  Mark Kerr submitted Dan Bobish in the UFC. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6642.9800000000005s)]
*  I was there for this fight. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6644.9800000000005s)]
*  He got on top of him. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6646.9800000000005s)]
*  And he stuck his chin in Bobish's eye socket. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6648.9800000000005s)]
*  Grabbed the back of his head. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6650.9800000000005s)]
*  And drove his fucking chin into his eye socket. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6652.9800000000005s)]
*  And he has this pointed chin too, man. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6654.9800000000005s)]
*  And he was just a giant of a man. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6656.9800000000005s)]
*  Show Mark Kerr in his prime. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6658.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean his trap started at the top of his ears. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6660.9800000000005s)]
*  He was so fucking huge. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6662.9800000000005s)]
*  He was so fucking huge. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6664.9800000000005s)]
*  He was so fucking huge. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6666.9800000000005s)]
*  He was so fucking huge. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6668.9800000000005s)]
*  He got, listen, by the time 96 came around. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6671.86s)]
*  He didn't look like that anymore. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6673.86s)]
*  He was like 250. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6675.86s)]
*  And he wasn't that big. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6677.86s)]
*  He wasn't that big. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6679.86s)]
*  Look at the size of him, bros. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6681.86s)]
*  He's gotta be 300 pounds there. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6683.86s)]
*  He was a monster. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6685.86s)]
*  And then he was a monster in Pride. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6687.86s)]
*  He was such a machine. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6689.86s)]
*  But he's another guy who fell victim to pain pills. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6691.86s)]
*  Yes he did. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6693.86s)]
*  And what's crazy about that documentary, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6695.86s)]
*  the smashing machine is, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6697.86s)]
*  he caught him in his prime. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6700.74s)]
*  And what they were documenting in that documentary [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6702.74s)]
*  was a guy who was like this unstoppable force. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6704.74s)]
*  They didn't know that he was at the verge of collapse. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6706.74s)]
*  They didn't know that he was in the middle of this pain edition. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6708.74s)]
*  Oh they were just doing the documentary because of how dominant he was. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6710.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6712.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6714.74s)]
*  The documentary originally was just about this guy [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6716.74s)]
*  who was this unstoppable force [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6718.74s)]
*  who was competing in Japan in the height of Pride. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6720.74s)]
*  In the height of Pride, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6722.74s)]
*  they were doing this like, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6724.74s)]
*  Japan is so powerful. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6726.74s)]
*  Japan is so different. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6729.62s)]
*  When we have the UFC in Japan, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6731.62s)]
*  they're so knowledgeable and so respectful. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6733.62s)]
*  It's such a part of the culture that, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6735.62s)]
*  you know, the matches were huge. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6737.62s)]
*  They did the Saitama Super Arena. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6739.62s)]
*  It was 90,000 people. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6741.62s)]
*  And that was when Kurt was in his prime. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6743.62s)]
*  So what they were documenting was this guy from America, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6745.62s)]
*  this insane wrestler, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6747.62s)]
*  this gigantic man that they called the smashing machine, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6749.62s)]
*  going over there and dominating. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6751.62s)]
*  And they caught him right when he was all falling apart. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6753.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6755.62s)]
*  And that's where the story changed, right? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6758.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6760.5s)]
*  And that's the documentary. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6762.5s)]
*  And it is about pain pills. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6764.5s)]
*  It's about pain medication. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6766.5s)]
*  I think he was on a bunch of different things. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6768.5s)]
*  But it was just dealing with the constant injuries. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6770.5s)]
*  He was the most talented individual I've ever stepped on the mat with. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6772.5s)]
*  I mean, he was really good. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6774.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6776.5s)]
*  Really good, yeah. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6778.5s)]
*  He won the NCAAs at 190. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6780.5s)]
*  My senior year, I wanted heavyweight. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6782.5s)]
*  And then he moved up to my weight class. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6784.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6787.38s)]
*  He just kept getting bigger and bigger. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6789.38s)]
*  Kids 6'4", so he had a lot of range. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6791.38s)]
*  Long arms. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6793.38s)]
*  You knew he could fill in. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6795.38s)]
*  I didn't know he was going to end up being 310 pounds. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6797.38s)]
*  Yeah, and then back then, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6799.38s)]
*  you were either going to go into pro wrestling [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6801.38s)]
*  or you were going to go into MMA. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6803.38s)]
*  And back then in MMA, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6805.38s)]
*  Mark was competing in the early days of bare knuckle. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6807.38s)]
*  Bare knuckle, [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6809.38s)]
*  wearing wrestling shoes, [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6811.38s)]
*  and Coleman as well, with head butts. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6813.38s)]
*  That was the other thing back then. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6816.26s)]
*  Yeah, they were legal. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6818.26s)]
*  I wonder if you can still do that eye socket move. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6820.26s)]
*  I don't even know if that's illegal. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6822.26s)]
*  I've never seen anybody do that since. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6824.26s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6826.26s)]
*  Mark Kerr submits Dan Bobish. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6828.26s)]
*  He submitted with it? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6830.26s)]
*  Oh, he tapped him. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6832.26s)]
*  Oh yeah, he tapped him with a fucking chin to the eye socket. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6834.26s)]
*  By the way, Bobish was fucking huge too. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6836.26s)]
*  Bobish was a giant of a man. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6838.26s)]
*  So for him to do that to Bobish, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6840.26s)]
*  Bobish is just not that level. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6842.26s)]
*  When you get that big, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6845.14s)]
*  there's big and then there's that big, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6847.14s)]
*  but also talented. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6849.14s)]
*  And that was Mark Kerr. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6851.14s)]
*  He had a head arm and drove his chin in? [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6853.14s)]
*  I want to say he mounted him. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6855.14s)]
*  I think he mounted him. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6857.14s)]
*  So here he is. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6859.14s)]
*  No, side control. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6861.14s)]
*  So he got on top of him, shoved his chin in his eye socket, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6863.14s)]
*  and just fucking drove it in there and tapped him. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6865.14s)]
*  I mean, the guy's in fucking agony. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6867.14s)]
*  And look at the size of Bobish. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6869.14s)]
*  Bobish was fucking huge. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6871.14s)]
*  He saw in his eye too. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6874.02s)]
*  Look at Kerr. Jesus Christ. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6876.02s)]
*  Oh, he does have a scary chin. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6878.02s)]
*  Yeah, he just shoved that thing right in his eye socket. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6880.02s)]
*  I don't think anyone's ever done that since. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6884.02s)]
*  The Leno Choke. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6886.02s)]
*  It wasn't a choke. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6888.02s)]
*  I lost a lot of sleep over this guy. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6890.02s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6892.02s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6904.02s)]
*  Early days. I guess he was wearing gloves in this one. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6906.02s)]
*  But when he started, he definitely was in the no-glove stage. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6908.02s)]
*  Who started first? [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6910.02s)]
*  Kerr or Coleman? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6912.02s)]
*  Well, Coleman was the first-ever UFC heavyweight champion. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6914.02s)]
*  Coleman beat Dan Severn, and that was in 1997. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6916.02s)]
*  That was the first UFC that I worked. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6918.02s)]
*  Is that when you made him tap out with a headlock? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6920.02s)]
*  That's how strong Coleman was. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6922.02s)]
*  Yes, he was very strong. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6924.02s)]
*  He got him in a judo, like a head and all. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6926.02s)]
*  He was a judo champion. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6928.02s)]
*  He was a judo champion. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6930.02s)]
*  He also got him in a head and arm. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6932.900000000001s)]
*  It was a choke, but it was a power choke. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6934.900000000001s)]
*  What he did is got a head and arm inside control [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6938.900000000001s)]
*  and got a hold of him. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6940.900000000001s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6942.900000000001s)]
*  Dan Severn, Mark Coleman. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6944.900000000001s)]
*  To me, it looked like a headlock. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6946.900000000001s)]
*  I know how strong he is. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6948.900000000001s)]
*  So I would probably tap out. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6950.900000000001s)]
*  It was a headlock, but he had him completely trapped in there. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6952.900000000001s)]
*  And that's Coleman in his fucking prime. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6954.900000000001s)]
*  He had a stint with alcohol, too. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6956.900000000001s)]
*  He's been doing that for a long time. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6958.900000000001s)]
*  He's been sober for a while. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6961.78s)]
*  He talks about that. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6963.78s)]
*  That's another big thing about his... [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6965.78s)]
*  That's bare knuckle, too. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6967.78s)]
*  He's got no gloves on. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6969.78s)]
*  Both guys have no gloves on. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6971.78s)]
*  He got him down. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6973.78s)]
*  By the way, Dan Severn was a hell of a wrestler as well. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6975.78s)]
*  I wrestled Dan. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6977.78s)]
*  I wrestled Dan. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6979.78s)]
*  It was my freshman year in college. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6981.78s)]
*  He was about 28 at the time. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6983.78s)]
*  I was 10 years younger than him. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6985.78s)]
*  There he is right there. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6987.78s)]
*  You got it right there. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6990.66s)]
*  So he gets him in this. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6992.66s)]
*  He gets him in this side control head choke. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6994.66s)]
*  It's really like a neck crank he got him in. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=6998.66s)]
*  This was the first UFC that I worked at. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7000.66s)]
*  I never wrestled a guy as strong as Coleman. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7002.66s)]
*  He was so strong. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7004.66s)]
*  I knew he was going to tap out here. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7006.66s)]
*  I watched his fight the night it happened. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7008.66s)]
*  He's crushing him. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7010.66s)]
*  I knew he was going to tap out here. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7012.66s)]
*  I watched his fight the night it happened. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7014.66s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7016.66s)]
*  I know how strong Coleman is. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7019.54s)]
*  Dan Severn's arm is almost green. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7021.54s)]
*  There's just no blood getting there. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7023.54s)]
*  This is a legit choke too. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7025.54s)]
*  If you can get a guy's arm trapped like that in between your thigh and his hand and with the amount of weight that Mark had. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7027.54s)]
*  He's just pressing down on him. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7035.54s)]
*  And that pressure. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7037.54s)]
*  The more he steps that way, the tighter it gets. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7039.54s)]
*  Dan's fucked. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7041.54s)]
*  I remember in Carlson Gracie's after this fight. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7043.54s)]
*  Look he's poking him in the eyes. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7048.42s)]
*  He tapped right there. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7050.42s)]
*  That was it. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7052.42s)]
*  And that was how Coleman became the first ever UFC heavyweight champion. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7054.42s)]
*  That was UFC 12. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7058.42s)]
*  And I had to go and interview him afterwards. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7062.42s)]
*  He was like who the fuck are you? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7064.42s)]
*  He was just jacked out of his mind. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7066.42s)]
*  This is me interviewing him. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7068.42s)]
*  I'm so nervous. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7078.42s)]
*  He's the first guy I ever interviewed. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7080.42s)]
*  Look at the size of him dude. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7088.42s)]
*  It's amazing that he wrestled at 220 pounds. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7094.42s)]
*  I think he was still competing in wrestling at the time too. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7096.42s)]
*  Or wanted to compete in wrestling. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7098.42s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7100.42s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7102.42s)]
*  1997. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7104.42s)]
*  This was a year after. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7107.3s)]
*  His last competition was 1996. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7109.3s)]
*  He was 32 at the time. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7111.3s)]
*  So you wrestled him when he was 28 and you were? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7113.3s)]
*  7. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7115.3s)]
*  And what happened there? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7117.3s)]
*  He beat me 1-0. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7119.3s)]
*  It was a college match. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7121.3s)]
*  I was a freshman in high school. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7123.3s)]
*  I was 18. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7125.3s)]
*  He was 28. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7127.3s)]
*  He was already on the USA team. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7129.3s)]
*  So I'd say I did pretty good for a young upcoming kid. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7131.3s)]
*  He's 28 but he still has that full mustache. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7133.3s)]
*  We beat each other quite a few times. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7136.18s)]
*  We went at it for a while. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7138.18s)]
*  It was really cool to see these guys having success in UFC. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7140.18s)]
*  This is when I won the Olympics. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7142.18s)]
*  I was bragging rights. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7144.18s)]
*  I beat these guys to win the UFC title. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7146.18s)]
*  People talked about that too. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7148.18s)]
*  Back then you were brought up a lot. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7150.18s)]
*  People were saying. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7152.18s)]
*  There was some talk. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7154.18s)]
*  Would Kurt Angle ever fight in the UFC? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7156.18s)]
*  In the early days of the UFC there was a lot of that. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7158.18s)]
*  There was quite a lot of talk. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7160.18s)]
*  There was a lot of talk. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7162.18s)]
*  There was quite a few guys that did. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7165.06s)]
*  Royce Alger. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7167.06s)]
*  Royce tried it out. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7169.06s)]
*  Quite a few elite wrestlers. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7171.06s)]
*  That competed in the UFC. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7173.06s)]
*  That skill set is the best skill set for MMA. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7175.06s)]
*  When you dictate where the fight takes place. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7177.06s)]
*  If that guy wanted to take you down, he's taking you down. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7179.06s)]
*  Back then the guys did not have the ability. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7181.06s)]
*  There were so many karate guys. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7183.06s)]
*  So many jiu jitsu guys. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7185.06s)]
*  They did not have the ability to stop that guy from taking him down. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7187.06s)]
*  You look at Khabib. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7189.06s)]
*  How scary. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7191.06s)]
*  He gets you down. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7193.9400000000005s)]
*  He puts his legs underneath your legs. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7195.9400000000005s)]
*  Now you have nowhere to go. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7197.9400000000005s)]
*  There's no standing up. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7199.9400000000005s)]
*  There's no jiu jitsu where there's no option like that. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7201.9400000000005s)]
*  Jiu jitsu. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7203.9400000000005s)]
*  I did a competition called The Contenders. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7205.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7207.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7209.9400000000005s)]
*  So it was jiu jitsu versus wrestling. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7211.9400000000005s)]
*  I remember that. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7213.9400000000005s)]
*  Wrestling didn't do that well. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7215.9400000000005s)]
*  Because they didn't understand submissions. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7217.9400000000005s)]
*  That was when Frank Shamrock was there. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7219.9400000000005s)]
*  I think he tapped Dan Henderson. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7222.82s)]
*  I think he got him on an ankle lock. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7226.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7228.82s)]
*  They just didn't understand the positions. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7230.82s)]
*  These guys were so good at submissions. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7232.82s)]
*  Kevin Jackson. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7234.82s)]
*  Kevin Jackson. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7236.82s)]
*  Kenny Monday. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7238.82s)]
*  That's right. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7240.82s)]
*  Kevin Jackson fought Frank Shamrock. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7242.82s)]
*  He got arm barred. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7244.82s)]
*  They just didn't understand the positions. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7246.82s)]
*  But if they did. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7248.82s)]
*  First of all, wrestlers are the very best at controlling bodies. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7251.7s)]
*  They're the very best at taking people down. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7253.7s)]
*  And then the next step is just understanding those submissions. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7255.7s)]
*  The hardest guys to deal with for sure in jiu jitsu are guys who are great wrestlers who learn jiu jitsu. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7257.7s)]
*  Because they already know how to control bodies. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7259.7s)]
*  So then they understand these new positions. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7261.7s)]
*  And they just have this massive advantage in being able to control bodies. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7263.7s)]
*  It's still the cornerstone for MMA. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7265.7s)]
*  If you can't wrestle, you can't fight. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7267.7s)]
*  Because guys just take you down. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7269.7s)]
*  And they're just going to take you down. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7271.7s)]
*  And they're going to take you down. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7273.7s)]
*  And they're going to take you down. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7275.7s)]
*  And they're going to take you down. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7277.7s)]
*  Because guys just take you down. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7280.58s)]
*  No matter how good a striker. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7282.58s)]
*  They're stand up fighters and they try to get in there and do it. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7284.58s)]
*  They get crushed. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7286.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's not a lot of guys who can't wrestle. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7288.58s)]
*  Who ever wind up doing well in the sport. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7290.58s)]
*  Yeah, I saw a funny thing. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7292.58s)]
*  Again, it's all on Instagram. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7294.58s)]
*  These memes lately are videos. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7296.58s)]
*  But I saw a good one of Derek Lewis going, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7298.58s)]
*  Wrestling's not that big of a deal. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7300.58s)]
*  All you have to do is stand up. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7302.58s)]
*  And then it shows this reel of wrestlers taking him down. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7304.58s)]
*  And he just goes, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7306.58s)]
*  And he just rolls over and starts planting a foot. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7309.46s)]
*  But not with Daniel Cormier. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7311.46s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7313.46s)]
*  Daniel Cormier got him down and submitted him. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7315.46s)]
*  It's just who you're doing it to. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7317.46s)]
*  That's who you're doing. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7319.46s)]
*  When you deal with a wrestler as elite as Cormier. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7321.46s)]
*  Here's Derek just standing up. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7323.46s)]
*  But Derek is just a giant of a man. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7325.46s)]
*  And has ferocious knockout power. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7327.46s)]
*  He just pushes people off. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7329.46s)]
*  The ability to plant a foot and just stand up is incredible. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7331.46s)]
*  But that reach around move, that's a legit move. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7333.46s)]
*  Whether he knew it or not. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7335.46s)]
*  Craig Jones does that. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7338.34s)]
*  That reach from the position. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7340.34s)]
*  You get into that spot. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7342.34s)]
*  He actually has, I think he calls it the octopus guard. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7344.34s)]
*  Or reach around. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7346.34s)]
*  Craig's really funny. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7348.34s)]
*  But Craig actually does that. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7350.34s)]
*  But he stands up with everybody. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7352.34s)]
*  And that's with Roy Nelson, who's a great grappler. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7354.34s)]
*  But you know, when you got Derek throwing punches at you. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7356.34s)]
*  There's not a human alive. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7358.34s)]
*  I mean that guy punches so fucking hard. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7360.34s)]
*  Scary. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7362.34s)]
*  He's so crazy powerful. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7364.34s)]
*  He just gets up. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7367.22s)]
*  And if you're fucking Roy Nelson. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7369.22s)]
*  You're like, oh shit. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7371.22s)]
*  Someone's going to get him in an American. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7373.22s)]
*  He's like, I think I'll just stand up. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7375.22s)]
*  Plants a foot. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7377.22s)]
*  Stands up. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7379.22s)]
*  Then turns around. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7381.22s)]
*  That's a guy Derek I think would shine in pro wrestling at the end of his career. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7383.22s)]
*  He just signed a new deal with the UFC. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7385.22s)]
*  A new, I think it's an eight fight deal. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7387.22s)]
*  They're really giving him a lot of money. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7389.22s)]
*  So I'm happy for him. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7391.22s)]
*  You think he'll go all eight fights? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7393.22s)]
*  It's so hard in that sport. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7396.1s)]
*  But the heavyweight division is so shallow. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7398.1s)]
*  All he needs is to string together a few wins and he can fight for the title. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7400.1s)]
*  Because there's really only. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7404.1s)]
*  I mean there's like fucking 15 or 20 elite heavyweights. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7406.1s)]
*  Whereas you go into like lightweight. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7410.1s)]
*  155. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7412.1s)]
*  There's a sea of them. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7414.1s)]
*  170. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7416.1s)]
*  185. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7418.1s)]
*  There's so many guys. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7420.1s)]
*  So there's like five times as many. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7422.1s)]
*  The heavyweight is probably the shallowest division. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7424.9800000000005s)]
*  Hasn't it always been? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7426.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7428.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just there's not that many. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7430.9800000000005s)]
*  Those guys go into the NFL. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7432.9800000000005s)]
*  Those guys go into the NFL. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7434.9800000000005s)]
*  NBA. Pro basketball. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7436.9800000000005s)]
*  I also think that the average human being is right in the middle. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7438.9800000000005s)]
*  165. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7442.9800000000005s)]
*  175. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7444.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that most of the people. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7446.9800000000005s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7448.9800000000005s)]
*  In amateur wrestling most of the wrestlers are in the middleweights. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7450.9800000000005s)]
*  And then as you go up and down they become less and less and less and less. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7453.86s)]
*  And then when you're at the very lightest weight there's very few. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7457.86s)]
*  And at the heaviest weight there's very few. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7459.86s)]
*  So there's like an average weight of people. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7461.86s)]
*  Of human beings. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7463.86s)]
*  And when you go higher and lower it gets lighter. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7465.86s)]
*  There's another guy that everybody wanted to see compete. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7467.86s)]
*  Nevermind. That's Karelin. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7469.86s)]
*  Did you ever get a chance to see Karelin compete? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7471.86s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7473.86s)]
*  You know what? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7475.86s)]
*  These guys were. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7477.86s)]
*  They were so scared of him that when he would pick him up for the reverse gut wrench. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7479.86s)]
*  They would pin themselves. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7482.74s)]
*  I went to the world championships one year. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7484.74s)]
*  And this guy's in the finals with Karelin. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7486.74s)]
*  And Karelin goes to lift him up. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7488.74s)]
*  And the guy turns over and pins himself. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7490.74s)]
*  I'm like why'd you do that? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7492.74s)]
*  You wrestled Karelin. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7494.74s)]
*  At least try to beat him. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7496.74s)]
*  They were worried about getting smashed. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7498.74s)]
*  Because he would pick you up and hit you with the world. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7500.74s)]
*  He would basically. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7502.74s)]
*  There's a photo that we have in the gym out here that I put up. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7504.74s)]
*  Just to remind myself of what a pussy I am. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7506.74s)]
*  It's Karelin. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7508.74s)]
*  Show that photo. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7511.62s)]
*  This black and white photo of Karelin. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7513.62s)]
*  Where he's about to pick this guy. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7515.62s)]
*  That photo right there. Look at that fucking photo. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7517.62s)]
*  Tell me that's not. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7519.62s)]
*  That dude was 300 fucking pounds. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7521.62s)]
*  And moved like a panther. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7523.62s)]
*  You know it's crazy that he got beat his last match. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7525.62s)]
*  Yeah. Well he got beat by a new rule. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7527.62s)]
*  A technicality. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7529.62s)]
*  Yeah. The technicality was when you broke the grip. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7531.62s)]
*  It counted as one point. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7533.62s)]
*  And it was really at the end of his career. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7535.62s)]
*  But Roulon Gardner was also a tank too. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7537.62s)]
*  He was. He was. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7540.5s)]
*  And Roulon went on to fight. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7542.5s)]
*  And he did fairly good. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7544.5s)]
*  Yeah he did well in Pride. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7546.5s)]
*  But I just had Roulon on my podcast. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7548.5s)]
*  And he said that you know. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7550.5s)]
*  Wrestling Karelin. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7552.5s)]
*  At that point in his career. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7554.5s)]
*  He knew that Karelin wasn't in the best form of shape. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7556.5s)]
*  Right. He wasn't the same. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7560.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But he was still Karelin. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7562.5s)]
*  He was still Karelin. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7564.5s)]
*  Doesn't matter. I mean he's the baddest dude on the planet. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7566.5s)]
*  He was so bad. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7569.38s)]
*  And for Roulon to stay close with him. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7571.38s)]
*  And then end up beating him on a technicality. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7573.38s)]
*  That's still pretty impressive. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7575.38s)]
*  Very impressive. If you watched Karelin training though. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7577.38s)]
*  What was so fantastic about Karelin. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7579.38s)]
*  Was his mobility. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7581.38s)]
*  Even though he was this enormous guy. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7583.38s)]
*  His mobility was sensational. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7585.38s)]
*  See if you can find some of that footage of Karelin training. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7587.38s)]
*  Good athlete. Good athlete. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7589.38s)]
*  Incredible athlete. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7591.38s)]
*  For a giant guy. He really emphasized his movement. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7593.38s)]
*  And you know. The Soviet training. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7595.38s)]
*  What they were doing with those guys back then was so technical. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7598.26s)]
*  Well you know the rumor about him right. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7600.26s)]
*  They called him the experiment. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7602.26s)]
*  Yeah. His parents were like small. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7604.26s)]
*  They were like my size. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7606.26s)]
*  And then you know all of a sudden they have this kid. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7608.26s)]
*  That just looks like some science project. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7610.26s)]
*  He does. He does look like an experiment. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7612.26s)]
*  It's like Ivan. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7614.26s)]
*  Who Ivan Drago. Yeah. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7616.26s)]
*  Was based off of right. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7618.26s)]
*  He would have picked Ivan Drago up and spiked him to China. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7620.26s)]
*  His feet would have been poking out of the fucking top of the earth. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7622.26s)]
*  But if you watch his training. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7624.26s)]
*  Like a lot of his training was like box jumps and kettlebells and mobility. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7627.14s)]
*  A lot of it was like movement based. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7629.14s)]
*  He was very very flexible. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7631.14s)]
*  So you see that when you kind of fast forward through that. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7633.14s)]
*  But what they showed before when he was on the mats there. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7635.14s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7637.14s)]
*  Him wiggling around on the top of his shoulders. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7639.14s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7641.14s)]
*  That's called mobility. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7643.14s)]
*  Yeah for a 300 pound guy. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7645.14s)]
*  I mean and this is at the end of his career too. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7647.14s)]
*  But he was so big. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7649.14s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7651.14s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7653.14s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7656.02s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7658.02s)]
*  He was so strong. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7660.02s)]
*  You see that in Ivan Drago who you see that in him too. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7662.02s)]
*  But he was all about athleticism. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7664.02s)]
*  You know and also being fucking enormous and incredibly strong. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7666.02s)]
*  But moved like a panther. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7668.02s)]
*  Now why didn't he fight? [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7670.02s)]
*  He had one kind of fake fight. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7672.02s)]
*  I think he had one. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7674.02s)]
*  Like in Japan what was interesting about Japan. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7676.02s)]
*  Japan had real fights mixed in with fake fights. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7678.02s)]
*  In the beginning. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7680.02s)]
*  They eventually became all real fights. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7682.02s)]
*  That was pride, right? [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7684.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7685.02s)]
*  So there were some fights that they had, and also in some other organizations, some smaller [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7686.02s)]
*  organizations. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7689.860000000001s)]
*  So is this Karelin? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7690.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7692.860000000001s)]
*  So this was kind of like a kind of a fake fight. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7693.860000000001s)]
*  I think he gets tapped in here. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7699.14s)]
*  And this is at the end, you know, he wasn't wrestling anymore. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7700.660000000001s)]
*  And I think they just probably gave him a lot of money. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7703.620000000001s)]
*  I forget how he loses here, but it seemed suspicious. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7706.580000000001s)]
*  Do you think he just threw it? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7713.42s)]
*  I think so. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7714.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7715.86s)]
*  Doesn't really show the ending here. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7716.86s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7719.46s)]
*  Watching him compete, I just didn't, I always thought that if he ever fought, he would just [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7721.58s)]
*  dominate. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7726.18s)]
*  I think he would have too. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7727.18s)]
*  In his prime, I don't think a human being would have been able to stop him. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7728.18s)]
*  No. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7731.46s)]
*  That was the end? [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7732.46s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7733.46s)]
*  So he didn't lose. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7734.46s)]
*  I thought, why? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7735.46s)]
*  I want to think maybe he fought more than once. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7736.46s)]
*  I don't think it was a real MMA fight though, because it just didn't, I don't know. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7739.18s)]
*  It was weird over there because Japan had such a history of pro wrestling that a lot [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7745.66s)]
*  of their early stars, you got to pay, a lot of their early stars in MMA were also stars [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7751.46s)]
*  in pro wrestling, like Takata. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7757.26s)]
*  When Takata fought in the first UFC. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7759.42s)]
*  But he fought Hickson Gracie and that was a real fight. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7762.860000000001s)]
*  Hickson was quite a bit smaller than him, but Hickson was the master of jiu-jitsu back [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7766.1s)]
*  then. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7770.46s)]
*  He was so bad. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7771.46s)]
*  Yeah, he was the man. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7772.46s)]
*  He was the man. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7773.46s)]
*  He was the guy that when Hoist Gracie won the UFC, everyone said, listen, Hoist is great, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7775.700000000001s)]
*  but his brother is literally a hundred times better than him. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7782.14s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7784.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7785.660000000001s)]
*  And then you would see him roll. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7786.660000000001s)]
*  What Hickson would do famously is he would teach a seminar with world champions in the [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7787.660000000001s)]
*  crowd, black belts. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7792.02s)]
*  Teach a seminar, explain to him certain principles that he used. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7793.48s)]
*  And then at the end of the seminar, he'd roll with everybody and he would roll with them [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7796.839999999999s)]
*  one at a time. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7799.799999999999s)]
*  So these guys would wait and then these black belts, world champions, like the top of the [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7800.799999999999s)]
*  food chain, they would go in there and roll with Hickson and Hickson would tap them all. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7805.04s)]
*  There's videos of it, of him just effortlessly tapping everybody. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7808.919999999999s)]
*  Just rotating in and out. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7813.5599999999995s)]
*  Rotating, no breaks, bring in the next guy, my friend. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7815.24s)]
*  And they would come in and he would tap them too. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7818.719999999999s)]
*  It's just his level of jiu-jitsu was so advanced. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7820.88s)]
*  He started, his dad was Elio Gracie. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7823.400000000001s)]
*  He started when he was a kid. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7825.76s)]
*  And the thing that separated him from some of those other guys was his physicality. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7827.8s)]
*  Because Hickson, his knowledge was as good, better than anybody's, but his movement and [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7832.040000000001s)]
*  his physicality, he was also, he was jacked. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7837.72s)]
*  He was like one of the first jacked Gracies. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7840.360000000001s)]
*  Well let me ask you this. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7843.4800000000005s)]
*  Why, why was Hoist the one they pushed? [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7844.68s)]
*  There's a lot of talk about that. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7847.320000000001s)]
*  Because of Hickson's age? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7849.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7850.6s)]
*  Because Hickson was still young. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7851.6s)]
*  It was, there was a, one thing was that Horian Gracie, who started the UFC, he could control [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7853.08s)]
*  Hoist. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7859.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7860.360000000001s)]
*  And you couldn't tell Hickson what to do. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7861.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7862.360000000001s)]
*  You know, and the thought was if Hoist ever lost, then they bring in Hickson. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7863.360000000001s)]
*  But Hoist didn't lose. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7867.120000000001s)]
*  Hoist was tapping everybody. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7868.120000000001s)]
*  And it was also, it was in some ways a better advertisement for Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7869.76s)]
*  Hoist was 175 pounds, who was tapping guys like Dan Severn with a triangle choke from [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7876.64s)]
*  his back. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7881.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he was smaller. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7882.4400000000005s)]
*  He was smaller than everybody. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7883.4400000000005s)]
*  So it showed just that Jiu-Jitsu was superior. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7884.4400000000005s)]
*  Because the early days of the UFC was really an advertisement for Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7888.200000000001s)]
*  Yes it was. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7892.360000000001s)]
*  Horian was a genius. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7893.360000000001s)]
*  And his idea was like, look, he knew that Jiu-Jitsu was superior if you didn't know [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7894.360000000001s)]
*  it. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7899.12s)]
*  So all these guys that didn't understand what those submissions were, they didn't understand [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7900.12s)]
*  those positions. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7902.56s)]
*  And Hoist wore the gi. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7903.56s)]
*  So when he would grab a hold of guys, guys would instinctively grab his gi. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7904.96s)]
*  They didn't understand. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7908.8s)]
*  They didn't know how to push him off. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7910.84s)]
*  They didn't know how to leg kick him. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7912.4s)]
*  They didn't know how to do any of those things back then. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7913.68s)]
*  So they would wind up getting dragged to the ground. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7915.72s)]
*  And Hoist was just so much better than everybody. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7917.8s)]
*  But still his brother was so much better than him. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7920.44s)]
*  Hickson. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7923.24s)]
*  Yeah, Hickson was the man. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7924.24s)]
*  And you know, and everybody said, there's like, there was no argument back then. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7925.92s)]
*  It was like, who's the best at Jiu-Jitsu? [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7930.4800000000005s)]
*  Everyone said Hickson. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7933.32s)]
*  That doesn't happen. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7935.16s)]
*  There's always debate. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7936.64s)]
*  You know, like even in boxing, like when Terrence Crawford fought Errol Spence, everybody was [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7937.64s)]
*  like, you know, maybe Spence is too big. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7942.400000000001s)]
*  Maybe Spence, I don't know. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7944.200000000001s)]
*  Back then, when it came to fighting, when it came to Jiu-Jitsu, everyone said it was [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7946.08s)]
*  Hickson. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7950.6s)]
*  But Hickson went over to Japan and he competed in Vali Tudo Japan in 1994. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7951.6s)]
*  And that was, what was it, 96? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7958.320000000001s)]
*  I forget. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7959.88s)]
*  It might have been 96. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7960.88s)]
*  And that was when, you know, MMA was really just emerging. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7962.08s)]
*  And first Pride, Pride 1 was with Hickson. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7967.0s)]
*  Hickson versus Takada. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7970.28s)]
*  Oh, Takada worked with Hickson. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7971.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7973.5599999999995s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7974.5599999999995s)]
*  Pride 1, Hickson versus Takada. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7975.84s)]
*  But it's just like, once Hickson got you to the ground, man, you were just fucked. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7978.0s)]
*  You were fucked. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7982.44s)]
*  He was just too good. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7983.44s)]
*  He was too good and he was strong. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7984.44s)]
*  He was just a different guy. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7986.08s)]
*  He was just different. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7988.0s)]
*  Now he was bigger than Hoyce, right? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7989.0s)]
*  Yes, he was bigger. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7990.68s)]
*  Does he have like a good Gracie documentary explaining how these guys basically invented [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7992.280000000001s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu and stuff? [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7996.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Gracie in action is very good. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7997.76s)]
*  But this is Hickson when he was young, when he was in his prime. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=7999.68s)]
*  I mean, this is, that's Hoyler behind him. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8003.92s)]
*  And this is like, and Takada at the time was this pro wrestler. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8006.8s)]
*  And you know, I don't know what he knew in terms of real martial arts. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8011.96s)]
*  And Hickson, I mean, this is a different world. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8017.52s)]
*  I mean, even if you just see how these guys are moving around, Hickson just stood straight [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8020.04s)]
*  up and walked towards him. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8024.56s)]
*  He doesn't look scared. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8027.44s)]
*  No, not at all. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8028.64s)]
*  He just knew all he has to do is get a hold of you. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8030.04s)]
*  But again, he's not fighting a guy who's like a real legit striker. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8032.34s)]
*  And when he did, he fought Funaki and Funaki wound up fracturing his orbital bone. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8037.28s)]
*  But Hickson choked him to sleep. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8041.4s)]
*  And like, one of the most dramatic finishes ever in MMA. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8043.4800000000005s)]
*  He like literally had him asleep out cold in a choke with blood all over the place. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8047.48s)]
*  It was pretty wild. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8053.08s)]
*  Was it his orbital bone or was it his opponent's? [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8054.08s)]
*  Oh, he got hit by Funaki and Funaki fractured his orbital. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8056.759999999999s)]
*  So now Hickson assumes mount. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8060.719999999999s)]
*  And by the way, this is, you know, nobody was as good as Hickson back then. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8063.0199999999995s)]
*  His Jiu-Jitsu was so good. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8066.879999999999s)]
*  And look, you see how different he is than Hoyse. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8068.24s)]
*  He was muscular. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8070.459999999999s)]
*  So he was very physically strong, incredibly agile. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8071.799999999999s)]
*  He could do yoga. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8075.679999999999s)]
*  He was an incredible yogi. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8077.16s)]
*  So he had like the physicality, but also the incredible. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8079.32s)]
*  So right now that right arm of Funaki's fuck or Takata's fucked. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8082.599999999999s)]
*  So as he's reaching with his arms right there, he doesn't understand. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8087.92s)]
*  Hickson's just kind of soften him up here. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8090.32s)]
*  He is kind of taking it easy on him. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8093.68s)]
*  Well, he's just he's just cooking them. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8095.28s)]
*  They would just take their time. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8097.96s)]
*  And once he's got you in mount, you're not getting out. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8099.599999999999s)]
*  He gets him in the arm bar here. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8101.599999999999s)]
*  So he picks an arm, whichever arm he chose. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8103.24s)]
*  I think he chose the left arm. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8106.36s)]
*  And he's basically just pushing down on him. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8109.08s)]
*  And now, yes, he is right knee comes up and that's it. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8110.96s)]
*  Wap. And now you're fucked. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8113.639999999999s)]
*  Now you're fucked. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8115.5199999999995s)]
*  And he tapped him. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8118.0s)]
*  Now, see, find Hickson versus Funaki. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8120.36s)]
*  That was Coliseum in the year 2000, I believe. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8123.48s)]
*  And that year was the year that that was when Fedor was emerging [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8127.839999999999s)]
*  and all these other guys were emerging. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8133.44s)]
*  And this is this was Hickson's final fight. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8136.12s)]
*  So you didn't fight after this. This is it. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8140.0s)]
*  No, this was it. This is his last fight. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8141.68s)]
*  And they they were talking about him fighting [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8143.6s)]
*  and competing against Fedor. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8147.12s)]
*  That was the big one. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8149.76s)]
*  And he wanted a very large sum of money that they probably should have paid him [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8151.08s)]
*  because that would have been insane. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8155.64s)]
*  How good was Fedor? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8157.2s)]
*  Fedor was amazing. He was amazing. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8158.8s)]
*  He might he might have been the best heavyweight of all time. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8161.56s)]
*  He certainly was in that argument in his prime. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8164.32s)]
*  So he's he's beating him up here. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8167.44s)]
*  And then he eventually gets gets his back and strangles him. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8169.32s)]
*  And he puts him to sleep. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8172.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's so dramatic because there's blood coming out of Funaki's face. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8173.92s)]
*  And he catches the choke here. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8178.4800000000005s)]
*  And Funaki doesn't tap either. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8180.72s)]
*  He just goes out. He goes out. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8182.36s)]
*  Yeah, he just goes out cold. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8183.88s)]
*  But he goes out with his eyes open. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8184.84s)]
*  So when you watch the choke, when they show right here. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8186.6s)]
*  Like this is it is a is a wrap right here. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8191.08s)]
*  So his eyes. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8193.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's out cold. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8196.4s)]
*  They're stuck open. Yeah, he's just out cold. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8198.36s)]
*  She's the early days, Kurt Angle. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8201.32s)]
*  That was the early days. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8205.0s)]
*  Barbaric. It was wild. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8206.12s)]
*  It's wild to see where it is now and to see what's really crazy is this [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8208.0s)]
*  for Francis and Gano Tyson fury fight that's going to happen. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8212.08s)]
*  It is it's happening. Wow. October. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8215.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Francis is coming in and talking about training for. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8218.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Is that in America? [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8221.68s)]
*  No, Saudi Arabia. Oh, OK. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8223.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. The Saudi Arabians, man. Oh, yeah. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8226.84s)]
*  They're throwing that money around. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8229.32s)]
*  I don't know how Francis is going to do the boxing match, right? [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8231.96s)]
*  Well, conventional wisdom says Tyson Fury is one of the greatest [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8236.08s)]
*  heavyweight boxers of all time is going to box his face off. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8239.519999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's conventional wisdom. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8242.119999999999s)]
*  But there's also the possibility that he overestimates things, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8243.48s)]
*  underestimates Francis and gets clipped. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8248.56s)]
*  Who knows? Few months. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8252.039999999999s)]
*  Tyson Fury could be a vegan. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8253.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, I'm just happy Francis is getting a lot of money. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8261.119999999999s)]
*  But Dana White talked about this recently that there is a possibility [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8264.8s)]
*  that if Francis fights [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8269.76s)]
*  Tyson Fury and after that comes back and fights John Jones, [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8273.24s)]
*  that would be the ultimate. Yeah. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8277.599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's. That would be ultimate straight losses. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8279.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, probably. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8285.08s)]
*  That's the thing about John to John could do everything. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8286.92s)]
*  Yeah. You know what? He's my favorite. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8289.48s)]
*  Yeah. Always has been ever since he came out, man. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8291.52s)]
*  I just he is the most overall talented fighter. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8295.84s)]

*  So intelligent to just knows what to do. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8300.24s)]
*  By the time he gets in in the octagon with someone, [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8303.2s)]
*  he knows everything about them. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8305.92s)]
*  He knows all their tendencies. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8307.68s)]
*  He knows what they do with the right leg forward. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8309.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He's meticulous about it. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8311.359999999999s)]
*  It's not luck that makes John that good. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8314.08s)]
*  Yeah. I thought it was talent. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8317.279999999999s)]
*  It's talent, too. It's talent, too. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8319.08s)]
*  But but it's one of those things, right? [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8320.84s)]
*  To be the best of the best. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8322.599999999999s)]
*  It can't just be talent. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8323.84s)]
*  There's got to be so many factors. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8325.519999999999s)]
*  It's mindset. It's that warrior mindset. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8326.8s)]
*  It's it's, you know, having an incredible skill set. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8329.4s)]
*  It's just knowing so much about the art of fighting. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8333.08s)]
*  And you got to realize John has been fighting at a world [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8337.84s)]
*  championship level for God. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8340.960000000001s)]
*  What year did he win the title? [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8343.6s)]
*  I mean, he won the title when he was 22 years old, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8345.880000000001s)]
*  when he fought Mauricio Shogun, who? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8349.0s)]
*  And since then, every fight he has had since then, [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8351.32s)]
*  except for like one or two, has been a world title fight. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8354.52s)]
*  Wow. Which is just nuts. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8357.16s)]
*  Yeah. Just nuts. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8358.92s)]
*  Like about consistent. Yeah. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8360.36s)]
*  And again, that wrestling base, it's got that wrestling base. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8362.8s)]
*  I mean, that wrestling base is, in my opinion, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8366.64s)]
*  the best base ever to enter into MMA. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8369.24s)]
*  And it's also what you were talking about with the training with Dan Gable. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8371.759999999998s)]
*  It's the mental toughness. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8374.72s)]
*  There's no one more mentally tough. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8376.4s)]
*  Yeah. Wrestlers do have a lot of mental toughness. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8377.759999999998s)]
*  And, you know, it's a tough sport. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8380.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yes. Yeah. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8383.48s)]
*  It's as tough as it gets. Yeah. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8385.0s)]
*  I mean, and there's no there's no money in it. Right. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8386.72s)]
*  So you have to be just tough. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8389.199999999999s)]
*  You can't be tough because, you know, you're going to buy a house [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8390.92s)]
*  tough because you want to ride a drive a Bentley. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8393.960000000001s)]
*  Even though weight cutting alone. Oh, yeah. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8396.12s)]
*  Well, did you ever have trouble cutting weight? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8399.16s)]
*  I didn't cut weight. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8401.44s)]
*  Have you? I wrestled up a weight class. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8402.68s)]
*  Oh, God, what a dream. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8405.76s)]
*  I actually weighed one ninety nine at the Olympics. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8407.72s)]
*  And the lower weight class was one ninety eight. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8412.32s)]
*  Wow. I wrestled at 220. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8415.36s)]
*  Yeah. Smart. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8417.960000000001s)]
*  And also I rest. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8419.800000000001s)]
*  I weighed one ninety seven when I wrestled the wrestler [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8420.84s)]
*  Turkani, NCAA champions championship, division one championship. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8423.16s)]
*  My senior year he was he was 270. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8427.32s)]
*  He's about six foot six. Real big, big kid. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8430.52s)]
*  Looked like a Greek god. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8433.76s)]
*  And you were one ninety nine. One ninety seven. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8435.24s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8437.68s)]
*  What was the mindset behind that of not not cutting that extra pound? [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8439.44s)]
*  Why? Why do I want to? [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8444.32s)]
*  I mean, I think I could have made it easily. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8447.24s)]
*  Easy. What I did is I tricked myself and said, [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8450.2s)]
*  you don't have to diet. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8453.08s)]
*  You just eat whatever you want. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8454.28s)]
*  You can stay where you are. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8455.64s)]
*  So I figured, you know, why? [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8457.48s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8461.2s)]
*  College is one ninety, not one ninety eight. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8464.08s)]
*  That's Olympics. Right. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8466.44s)]
*  That was the what the old weight classes in the Olympics. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8467.84s)]
*  College is one ninety. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8471.0s)]
*  I would have had to lose seven pounds to make it. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8472.0s)]
*  So why starve myself when I don't have to? [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8474.96s)]
*  I can win a heavyweight. Wow. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8477.759999999998s)]
*  That was that was my [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8479.48s)]
*  that was my reason. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8481.839999999998s)]
*  Well, that's incredible, because that's how good you were. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8482.839999999998s)]
*  You actually did that. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8484.72s)]
*  Yeah. Nobody else has that that problem. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8486.0s)]
*  Right. That's the whole mindset of weight cutting. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8489.08s)]
*  Yeah. I'd rather know what a bigger guy. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8491.24s)]
*  Yeah. I was a hand fighter and I had great positioning. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8493.039999999999s)]
*  And that's that's why I won so many matches that nobody could score on me. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8496.039999999999s)]
*  And and I was always on them. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8500.48s)]
*  You know, I was getting them tired and I never, never let them breathe. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8503.44s)]
*  I was all over them, just hand fighting and attacking them and [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8508.32s)]
*  staying in their face, headbutting them, everything, anything I could do. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8512.720000000001s)]
*  The time that you wrestled Brock, do you remember what you did? [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8515.880000000001s)]
*  Was it double leg takedowns? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8518.720000000001s)]
*  Did you like duck under? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8520.28s)]
*  Ah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8521.84s)]
*  Because Brock Brock would come with these double legs. Right. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8523.24s)]
*  He'd come up and I'd jack them up and duck under and get behind them. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8526.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So it would be like in a flurry. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8529.76s)]
*  You know, I wouldn't just do a move. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8532.640000000001s)]
*  He'd do something I'd counter and do it. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8534.720000000001s)]
*  You'd be happy to know I beat up on our friend David Lucas, [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8537.2s)]
*  who weighs about 330 pounds with a duck under. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8539.68s)]
*  Who did? I did. You did. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8543.68s)]
*  At one hundred and forty five pounds. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8545.24s)]
*  Well, David was tired in 13 seconds. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8548.32s)]
*  13. David's David's a little. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8552.2s)]
*  All of his training is exhaust training. Yeah. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8554.560000000001s)]
*  He starts out exhausting. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8558.84s)]
*  Yeah. But there was a lot of shit talking before that. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8562.52s)]
*  They wrestled on the stage at the Vulcan Comedy Club. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8565.28s)]
*  Yeah. It was hilarious. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8568.48s)]
*  He was talking shit for months. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8569.84s)]
*  There he is. Oh, my God. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8573.24s)]
*  Flat. David was done. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8575.0s)]
*  See me counting the score. Two points. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8577.52s)]
*  We had we had Chinese dumplings right before. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8581.76s)]
*  Whiskey, tequila, Chinese dumplings and blunt. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8586.84s)]
*  So it's not exactly a sanctioned wrestling match. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8589.68s)]
*  It definitely was not that it definitely was not that I did [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8592.32s)]
*  take off my cowboy boots to do that. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8595.279999999999s)]
*  I still have a bandana wrapped around my neck. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8597.0s)]
*  I think he's wearing socks, too. Yeah. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8598.64s)]
*  That was just incredible about your career was that you were able [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8600.92s)]
*  to accomplish that by violating that one cardinal rule. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8604.08s)]
*  You want to fight and be the biggest you can in your weight class. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8607.48s)]
*  And you were like, fuck it. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8610.4s)]
*  I I didn't want to have to do that. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8612.4s)]
*  I didn't want to have to lose weight. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8615.24s)]
*  I was like, why? [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8616.44s)]
*  You know, I just wrestled 220 for the Olympics and heavyweight [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8618.119999999999s)]
*  for college wrestling. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8622.0s)]
*  How much do you think you weighed in the Olympics? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8623.76s)]
*  I weighed 190. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8625.88s)]
*  I weighed 199 when I wrestled 220. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8627.72s)]
*  Wow. And the weight class below was 198. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8631.0s)]

*  Were you a little bit faster? This was Turkey. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8635.52s)]
*  This is the guy six foot six. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8637.24s)]
*  He was 270 and I was one hundred ninety seven here. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8638.6s)]
*  Incredible. Yeah. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8643.48s)]

*  He pinned everybody. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8654.640000000001s)]
*  Actually, he pinned all five opponents before this match. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8655.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, and within a minute, did any of your coaches try to get you [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8659.28s)]
*  to go down to the next weight? [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8663.68s)]
*  They they never fought me on it. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8666.800000000001s)]
*  They knew that they knew my mind was made up. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8669.24s)]
*  So they didn't care. I was winning titles. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8671.92s)]
*  So, yeah, I guess as long as you're winning. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8674.960000000001s)]
*  But it's so crazy that you violated that conventional wisdom. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8677.68s)]
*  You know what? I would have won at one ninety two. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8680.960000000001s)]
*  I not that I'm bragging, but, you know, Mark Kerr won the NCAAs. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8683.480000000001s)]
*  I when Kerr started beating me, he got he got bigger. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8689.160000000002s)]
*  But I think I could have probably beaten Kerr in college. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8692.240000000002s)]
*  So it wasn't like I had was trying to stay away from people. Right. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8695.52s)]
*  You know, it was I just didn't have to lose weight. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8699.68s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8702.2s)]
*  You know, that's the one of the biggest problems in MMA [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8703.68s)]
*  is the weight cutting. It's a real problem. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8706.76s)]
*  You know what? Not only that, not only is it hard, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8709.08s)]
*  it takes the fun out of it. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8712.800000000001s)]
*  And then you don't enjoy what you're doing anymore. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8714.32s)]
*  And not only you have to worry about the fight now, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8717.16s)]
*  you have to worry about your weight, too. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8719.72s)]
*  And it's just like you just have so much shit, so much stress going on. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8721.08s)]
*  At one time, the last thing you need to be worrying about is your weight. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8724.6s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8727.92s)]
*  And all you're worrying about, at least from my high school experience, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8729.52s)]
*  all you're worrying about is your weight until the match. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8733.560000000001s)]
*  And then you're like, OK, now I get to now I get to fight. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8736.68s)]
*  And then you're like, oh, shit, I have to fight. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8739.2s)]
*  And I will also agree with you, because when you're cutting weight, [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8740.6s)]
*  you're not training properly. Right. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8745.6s)]
*  You're not able to have the energy to train right. Right. Right. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8747.32s)]
*  So now all you're doing is you're letting someone beat you up [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8750.4s)]
*  while you have plastics on you, roll it up in a ball. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8752.76s)]
*  And this person is just beating the shit out of you and trying to get you to sweat. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8754.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It really lowers your work ethic. Yeah. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8758.68s)]
*  So you don't want to do that. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8762.2s)]
*  But I've always had it about MMA. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8763.68s)]
*  It's the one thing that I would cut out if I could. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8765.08s)]
*  I think there should be more weight classes and I think they should. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8767.24s)]
*  They should make guys fight at whatever the weight they're. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8769.92s)]
*  I think it's sanctioned cheating. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8771.96s)]
*  I mean, I really do. I really think that's what it is. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8773.44s)]
*  When you got guys like like Alex Pahey, that's probably the best example. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8775.84s)]
*  He weighed in at one eighty five when he fought Israel. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8779.76s)]
*  Adesanya won the title when he got into the octagon. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8782.36s)]
*  He was 226. Oh, he got. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8784.64s)]
*  He gained that much weight in 40 pounds. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8788.64s)]
*  You know what? That that is what I was scared of. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8791.12s)]
*  That's what happened to me for the Olympics. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8793.560000000001s)]
*  Like Mark Kerr, Mark Coleman, they would cut down to 220 and get up to 245. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8796.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I was wrestling down at, you know, 200, 200, 199 pounds. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8800.640000000001s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, man, like, this is not right. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8805.36s)]
*  But, you know, I guess probably tired more. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8808.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, they did. They did. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8811.52s)]
*  I mean, especially if you have a full belly and you're wrestling on a full belly. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8813.2s)]
*  Hmm. Right. Because they've been starving themselves forever. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8817.2s)]
*  So, you know, when they finally get a chance to eat, they're going to eat. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8820.44s)]
*  That's going to slow them down. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8822.84s)]
*  But then the mindset is, but at least somebody would be bigger. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8823.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, you're right. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8826.52s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's the ultimate triumph of skill and mindset over everything else. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8827.960000000001s)]
*  You know, it didn't matter what you weighed. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8833.6s)]
*  No, it's pretty fucking impressive. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8835.800000000001s)]
*  I have to worry about it. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8837.36s)]
*  And you know what? My training was better than anyone else's. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8837.960000000001s)]
*  I had more intense training. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8841.28s)]
*  I was able to do whatever I wanted to do. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8842.560000000001s)]
*  And I could eat whatever I wanted to eat. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8844.800000000001s)]
*  And you could recover better. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8847.04s)]
*  Yeah, I was recovering a lot quicker than everybody else. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8848.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8850.960000000001s)]
*  Well, I really wish they would do something about that in MMA. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8852.44s)]
*  I really do. Yeah. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8855.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just think if they just had more weight classes, there's just only eight. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8856.960000000001s)]
*  They should have more weight classes. That's not enough. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8860.12s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8862.6s)]
*  I'd say about 12. I think 12. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8863.68s)]
*  You're right. Yeah. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8865.84s)]
*  I think every 10 pounds is the right way to go. Yeah. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8866.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, in boxing, I mean, you've got it's so much different. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8868.84s)]
*  You got 135, then you got 140 and then you got 147 and then you got 154 [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8872.24s)]
*  and then you got 160 and then you got 168 and then you want 75. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8876.72s)]
*  Like that's that to me makes more sense. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8880.0s)]
*  It makes a lot more sense. Yeah. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8882.84s)]
*  But it's just for whatever reason, this is just how people have been doing it [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8884.72s)]
*  for a long time in MMA. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8889.039999999999s)]
*  And like when you stand there, like there's guys that weigh 185 pounds [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8890.279999999999s)]
*  and I stand next to them when I'm interviewing them, like, how the fuck [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8894.119999999999s)]
*  did you ever weigh like Paheta? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8897.56s)]
*  How the fuck are you ever 185? Right. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8899.359999999999s)]
*  What's he 210? He's giant. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8902.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he's fucking dense like this table. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8903.88s)]
*  Like when you put your hand on the guy, he feels like a table. Right. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8906.8s)]
*  It's just nuts. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8910.08s)]
*  And it takes a lot out of their body, too. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8911.199999999999s)]
*  It's terrible for their kidneys, terrible for their just their overall body. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8913.96s)]
*  24 hours before an MMA fight. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8919.0s)]
*  You're literally on death's door. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8922.4s)]
*  Almost dead. You're exactly right. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8924.599999999999s)]
*  There have been a lot of guys that cut weight. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8926.4s)]
*  They've been rushed to a hospital. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8928.119999999999s)]
*  There's Paheta before and after. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8929.76s)]
*  It's hard to tell. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8931.4s)]
*  Like that's see, see there at 99 kilograms. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8932.76s)]
*  So what is 99 kilograms, 220 something? [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8935.6s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. Yeah, that's two. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8937.880000000001s)]
*  And then he went up to light heavyweight and he just beat Jan [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8939.92s)]
*  Bojovic at light heavyweight, who is the former light heavyweight champion. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8942.800000000001s)]
*  But he's a real freak. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8946.640000000001s)]
*  He's the greatest example of weight cutting. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8948.28s)]
*  Like there's no no one cuts weight like that guy. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8950.6s)]
*  No one's that big at 185 pounds. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8952.6s)]
*  He has some tricks up his sleeve. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8954.84s)]
*  He's able to cut weight like that. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8956.56s)]
*  I don't know what he's doing. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8958.0s)]
*  It's a lot of mental toughness to a lot of mental toughness. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8959.4s)]
*  Maybe genetics, maybe his body is able to do it better. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8962.92s)]
*  Some guys just their body breaks down. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8965.560000000001s)]
*  They're trying to dehydrate themselves like that. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8968.28s)]
*  It's hard brushing your teeth the morning of. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8969.76s)]
*  That's the thing I always remember the Saturday mornings, brushing your teeth. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8972.04s)]
*  Your mouth wants to drink the water, swallow the toothpaste because it's in your mouth. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8975.68s)]
*  There's been nothing in your mouth for days. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8981.44s)]
*  You want to swallow it. Yeah, exactly. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8983.640000000001s)]
*  What's crazy about wrestling is you have to compete the day of. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8985.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you weigh in and then you compete. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8988.52s)]
*  That's what's nuts. Yeah. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8991.12s)]
*  That's really nuts because of MMA, the stark contrast. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8992.56s)]
*  They also now they weigh in in the morning. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=8997.08s)]
*  And then what we do is we have an official weigh in ceremony at five p.m. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9000.279999999999s)]
*  So when I announce it, I'll say, you know, like Robert Whitaker, official weight 186. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9006.32s)]
*  But he's not 186 when he's standing there. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9012.76s)]
*  He's really probably like 200 pounds. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9015.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's like 186 is like for a couple of minutes. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9016.76s)]
*  Yeah, we get down there, sucks it up, and then they start [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9020.32s)]
*  rehydrating the electrolytes and the espada. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9023.72s)]
*  Yeah. So here's during the wake. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9028.4s)]
*  I mean, the guy's fucking dying. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9030.08s)]
*  Look at him. He's just lying there. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9031.84s)]
*  They're covering them with plastics and there's no energy. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9034.0s)]
*  No, I mean, he's he's literally dying. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9037.28s)]
*  I mean, you can't do this very long. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9040.2s)]
*  And it takes a long fucking time for him to drain himself down to 185. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9042.119999999999s)]
*  And I think he's more suited to 205. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9047.56s)]
*  And how tall is he? He's big. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9050.12s)]
*  He's about six, four. Oh, gosh. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9051.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's big and just got giant mitts. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9053.84s)]
*  I mean, his fucking hands are huge. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9057.48s)]
*  Guys got just pause, just massive knockout power and a huge size advantage. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9059.48s)]
*  But also, I think it affects your chin. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9065.960000000001s)]
*  I think when you do cut that kind of weight, you can't take a shot as well. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9068.84s)]
*  You take a shot better when your body's healthy. Yeah. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9072.76s)]
*  When you're eating right. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9076.599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, you're mentally and physically strong. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9077.8s)]
*  So when Tyson Fury fights Francis and Ghana, Francis and Ghana [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9081.119999999999s)]
*  used to cut weight to make 265, which is crazy because the UFC has a weight. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9085.16s)]
*  No, the UFC had a weight limit, which is nuts on their heavyweights. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9090.88s)]
*  On the heavyweights. Yeah. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9095.4s)]
*  Yeah, because there's a super heavyweight division that we've never used. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9096.92s)]
*  That's anybody ever use it. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9100.0s)]
*  Pride, you know, but pride is crazy rules like pride. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9102.599999999999s)]
*  They're allowed to do steroids like when Ensign Inouye was on my podcast, [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9105.76s)]
*  he explained that the pride in pride they had in the contract [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9109.800000000001s)]
*  in all capital letters, we do not test for steroids. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9113.720000000001s)]
*  No, yeah, I'm not telling you what to do, but I'm telling you what to do. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9117.6s)]
*  Right. Right. Take them. Yeah. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9122.52s)]
*  They wanted you to look awesome. Right. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9124.560000000001s)]
*  You know, they wanted you to fight at your best and look huge. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9126.76s)]
*  That'll that'll help. That'll help. Yeah. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9130.640000000001s)]
*  Might mean for sure. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9132.92s)]
*  Yeah. Crazy sport. Yeah. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9134.92s)]
*  Well, Kurt Angle, it's been an honor and a privilege having you in here, man. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9138.2s)]
*  I'm a giant fan. You're a fucking stellar human being. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9141.92s)]
*  Can I ask one more question? Yes, please do. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9145.76s)]
*  I've always wanted to know where does one keep a gold medal like yours? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9147.36s)]
*  Good question. Is it in a sock? Is it in a safe? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9151.44s)]
*  Is it right when you walk into your house in a glass case? [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9153.960000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what happened. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9156.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I used to take it with me to all my events whenever I would speak [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9157.960000000001s)]
*  or do appearances. The actual one? [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9162.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Wow. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9165.039999999999s)]
*  And so one time I took it to an appearance and this little kid grabbed it [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9166.24s)]
*  and he was holding it. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9171.64s)]
*  Then he kind of grabbed the ribbon. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9172.56s)]
*  They start flinging it. Oh, no. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9174.56s)]
*  And he let it go and hit the wall. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9176.4s)]
*  OK, so there was a big dent in my gold medal. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9178.16s)]
*  So I never took it to another event again. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9181.279999999999s)]
*  It's been in my it's been in my safe because my kids, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9184.359999999999s)]
*  they were playing Barbie one day and they had the [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9189.08s)]
*  they had the gold medal around the Barbie. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9191.44s)]
*  And I was like, OK, they're just going to get makeup on this. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9193.36s)]
*  So I decided from now on, I'm going to keep it in a safe. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9195.76s)]
*  So it's a way for my kids. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9198.880000000001s)]
*  It's way from anybody that's going to do any damage to it. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9201.28s)]
*  Because I already had damage done to my medal and I'm not going to have it again. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9204.400000000001s)]
*  There's a kid out there somewhere listening to this cringing. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9207.480000000001s)]
*  How old do you think that kid is now? [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9210.84s)]
*  Oh, God, that was 10 years ago. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9212.44s)]
*  He'd be he'd be about 18. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9214.2s)]
*  He's probably listening. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9216.36s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9217.36s)]
*  You know what? I never even thought about that. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9222.32s)]
*  Oh, that poor kid. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgHt-fCEjm0&t=9224.12s)]
