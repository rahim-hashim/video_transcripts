# Joe Rogan Experience #2126 - Donnell Rawlings
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWO40xAksOg)
*  the Joe Rogan Experience
*  trained by Dave Joe Rogan Podcast by night all day
*  I don't wanna, I don't wanna try to do you dirty don't I?
*  Don't do that man, don't do that man, don't start with that
*  Birds flying high, you know how I feel
*  They try to do you dirty
*  Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
*  They tried to set you up.
*  It's a new day.
*  It's a new dawn.
*  They tried to label you.
*  It's a new life for me, and I'm feeling good, Joe.
*  You look good.
*  You look real good.
*  Where'd you get that suit?
*  Who made that suit for you?
*  La Cattino out of Brooklyn and some Korean tailors
*  that I've been working with for the last two years.
*  And they trying to make me go from Ashley to Clarence,
*  and it's a new day.
*  I think it looks great.
*  And another thing you don't know is about this suit, Joe.
*  I smell as good as this suit looks.
*  Okay.
*  What is it for smell?
*  What is it called?
*  Sent, Portrait of a Lady.
*  It's an Arabic company.
*  That's all I know.
*  And I got a guy that outsources my colognes and shit.
*  What do you do?
*  Like a little here, a little here,
*  and a little on the wrists?
*  How you do it?
*  Or do you spray it and walk through it?
*  I spray it, walk through it, and then I,
*  I do that an anointing amount, like, okay, we get it.
*  You got some nice cologne on right now.
*  But it's good to be here.
*  There's something nice about a nice suit, man.
*  It does make you look professional.
*  It makes you work on your posture.
*  And one thing I did, another thing that I came here today,
*  and it was my intent, Joe, to break all the stereotypes.
*  So I got here 20 minutes earlier
*  than I was supposed to be here.
*  You came 20 minutes late.
*  You enforced the stereotypes.
*  And I wore a suit without a court date,
*  without a funeral, and without a marriage proceeding.
*  So this is the whole thing of Don-El in a new day
*  and changing his life.
*  I'm going through a transition.
*  What motivated this?
*  Law and order?
*  No.
*  Law and order didn't,
*  law and order didn't motivate this.
*  Law and order, first off,
*  law and order is one of the most respected franchises
*  in the history of television.
*  It's been around a long time.
*  Shout out to,
*  Shout out to IHT.
*  Shout out to Dick Wolf, and shout out to,
*  everybody's a part of that.
*  And they say in New York, they say that
*  you can't call yourself an actor in New York
*  unless you've been in law and order.
*  That's how it makes sense.
*  It makes so many, so many.
*  How many versions do they have?
*  I've been in every,
*  when I first began in my career,
*  people really thought I was a dramatic actor
*  more than a comic.
*  I was booking a lot of stuff.
*  I've been on every one of the episodes,
*  not episodes, but shows.
*  And out of them, I think 80% of them, I was arrested.
*  And I was like, wait a minute, am I getting typecast?
*  Every time I was, they'd be like,
*  action, I'm not just, and what I do?
*  What I do this time?
*  Every one, every one of them,
*  I got arrested for something.
*  How many of them are there?
*  How many law and orders are there, Gene?
*  Special victims?
*  Special victims.
*  I'm gonna say, I'm gonna guess, I'm gonna say five.
*  Five different law and orders.
*  Homicide was technically part of it too.
*  Oh, maybe, no, this is related, nevermind, hold on.
*  You got law and order, special victims unit.
*  Two.
*  Organized crime.
*  Three.
*  Adapted series, law and order, Toronto, criminal intent.
*  SUV is that one?
*  Law and order, criminal intent.
*  Five.
*  Trial by jury.
*  Six.
*  LA.
*  Seven.
*  True crime.
*  Eight.
*  Hate crimes.
*  Oh, this is in development, hate crimes for the defense.
*  They can have a whole show dedicated to hate crimes.
*  But that brand is like,
*  and I don't think those guys,
*  I mean, Dick Wolf and Arthur Formy,
*  when I first, I did it years ago,
*  when I first did it, Arthur Formy was the director
*  when I did it.
*  And that was like, and I think like in 2000.
*  And then recently, people love to watch those shows
*  where they get the bad guy.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to catch the bad guy.
*  And you have to have a bad guy.
*  Yeah, you have a bad guy and you gotta catch him.
*  But everybody is, everybody is more interested
*  in the bad guy more than anything.
*  That's in life general.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why you find so many people
*  that necessarily don't have a lot of talent,
*  but they subscribe to the bad guy side of it
*  and wanna be negative.
*  And then everybody draws to that.
*  The bad guy is winning like a motherfucker.
*  The bad guy is winning.
*  In what way?
*  Yes.
*  In what way?
*  What do you mean?
*  I'll just say, I'll just say like this,
*  and I'm not being specific to anybody in general,
*  even in the world of podcasts right now.
*  The model for a lot of people now is like,
*  say some outlandish shit,
*  say some shit that's gonna piss somebody off,
*  say some shit that's gonna make people hate you.
*  And now you have a platform and you have a successful
*  platform because at the end of the day,
*  with this, it's all about engagement.
*  It's all about, can you get people to engage?
*  At the end of the day, if you can do that,
*  whether people like you or not, you win.
*  Sort of, but I think people get tired of that.
*  They get tired of conflict.
*  If your whole business is conflict,
*  people don't wanna be in conflict all the time.
*  And they realize that a lot of conflict is unnecessary.
*  And if you're the type of person that likes to talk
*  about conflict constantly and talk about it online,
*  you probably also are willingly participating in it,
*  maybe a little too willingly.
*  Like maybe you're getting, you know,
*  you're creating problems, creating problems in your own life,
*  even as you get attention.
*  Like be careful what you wish for.
*  Because if you're known for just talking shit about people
*  and then you become successful,
*  then people are gonna talk shit about you.
*  They're all gonna come after you.
*  But the people that like that,
*  they don't have a conscience to even care about that.
*  Yeah, but everybody has a conscience.
*  I just think we accept a certain amount of bullshit.
*  We accept it.
*  And I think you should just concentrate
*  on doing whatever the fuck you do well.
*  You don't have to just say outlandish shit
*  and be so negative.
*  I just don't think it's necessary.
*  You don't, but you are living in a different world
*  than black Twitter.
*  It does work.
*  It gets people's attention.
*  No, who you went to, the people you're speaking to?
*  But black Twitter, and on these urban sites,
*  you could be negative for years and years and years
*  and years and years and years,
*  and a motherfucker will come up.
*  And that's the truth.
*  You are around a world of,
*  oh, he's a jolly good fellow.
*  But in that dark world, in that black Twitter world,
*  it's a lot, lot of negativity.
*  And it's very unfortunate.
*  That is unfortunate.
*  That's a very unfortunate thing.
*  I don't enjoy that.
*  I get it.
*  Black Twitter?
*  No, insulting people, getting mad at people.
*  At a certain point in your life,
*  I realized that there's no room for that in life.
*  You don't have to,
*  you can avoid it for the most part.
*  If you get avoided in your immediate life,
*  you could probably avoid it in your internet life too.
*  I think you avoid that conflict and negative energy
*  the more successful you become,
*  because I think that creates a
*  I don't give a fuck about bullshit attitude.
*  I think a lot of the anger and a lot of frustration
*  that comes with a lot of people
*  is the beginning of the stage,
*  it's the beginning stages.
*  But when you get, like we were talking about it earlier.
*  Damn it, fuck, you gave me that joint too quick.
*  You gave me that motherfucking joint too quick.
*  We were talking,
*  this is a bad one.
*  Because I tried to get that pause
*  to get my thought back.
*  I don't know what the fuck you just gave me,
*  but it just erased everything I was just thinking about.
*  You were talking about as you get successful,
*  it's easier to avoid conflict,
*  which I probably agree with.
*  Also, you're comfortable enough where you could recognize
*  the patterns that are beneficial
*  and not beneficial to you in your life.
*  And conflict is never beneficial to me.
*  Even conflict that I've engaged in,
*  that was necessary.
*  That's been your entire,
*  not even as a fucking young Joe Rogan,
*  you didn't have to end your life.
*  Fuck this or fuck that motherfucker,
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  You've always been this calm.
*  You've always been this collected and this calm
*  your entire career.
*  No, definitely not.
*  So that goes to my point.
*  Yeah, but I learned how to do it.
*  Because I realized, you know what happened once, man?
*  This is a true story.
*  I was watching this dude on stage
*  and I was hoping that he was bombing.
*  I was hoping he would bomb,
*  because he went on after me.
*  I didn't want him to do well.
*  And I realized, I go,
*  what a bitch ass way to think that is.
*  To want someone to not do well.
*  I was 21 and I'll never forget it.
*  But that's the age though, Joe.
*  That's the age when you like,
*  fuck it, that's it, night night.
*  Bye bye.
*  At that age, everyone is so ambitious and competitive
*  that was getting into comedy at that time,
*  that it was like,
*  it wasn't very,
*  there wasn't a lot of camaraderie
*  between like the open micers.
*  Cause everybody was like super desperate.
*  Like you remember the desperate days
*  where you weren't sure
*  if you were ever gonna be a professional?
*  Like there's desperate days.
*  I've never felt that way.
*  Never?
*  I'm telling you,
*  it's not being cocky or whatever you wanna say.
*  I've never felt that way.
*  Back to open mics?
*  The first open mic I ever did,
*  I got a standing ovation.
*  That's insane.
*  I got a standing ovation.
*  I think it wasn't a standing ovation
*  because I had the best material.
*  I was the funniest.
*  But earlier on, I used to go to the comedy clubs
*  and fuck with comedians.
*  Right?
*  And I probably shared this.
*  I used to heckle comedians.
*  And people started coming to the show to see me heckle.
*  So it was a thing.
*  This is why when people say I'm an interrupter,
*  I've been an interrupter.
*  I've been an interrupter before I even got on stage.
*  That's hilarious.
*  And how old?
*  I had to be like 21 or 22.
*  Perfect.
*  And the thing was, people started getting excited for me.
*  They knew that I was the guy in the audience that was funny.
*  But it was like some people in clubs, they hang around,
*  you'd be like, man, he should do it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Or like one day he should try.
*  So I had ruined all the other comedians' careers.
*  I just destroyed them.
*  They used to come up to me and be like,
*  could you not fuck with me?
*  I'm working on some new material.
*  I'm like, it's my job to heckle you.
*  It's your job to try to be funny.
*  You were a professional heckler.
*  I was a professional heckler.
*  That is so insane.
*  So much that, and I drew.
*  I was drawing the audience.
*  That's so, how has this happened?
*  It just happened.
*  And then eventually the club wanted me to shut the fuck up.
*  They was like, we'll shut his ass up if he go on stage.
*  And then the audience,
*  people really started coming to see me talk shit.
*  And I think the night, the first night I went on,
*  I think it was to build up something people felt like,
*  this dude is gone.
*  They felt like I was working for Safeway
*  as a security guard in a grocery store.
*  And the first time I went on stage,
*  all the people that for my job used to come,
*  they all looked at me like,
*  he's about to quit or get fired.
*  It was just something that by chance,
*  I never thought about doing comedy.
*  I used to go there
*  because I got free promotional tickets.
*  I never was the guy when I was younger, at 13,
*  when I first looked into the mirror,
*  I knew that comedy is what I wanted to do.
*  It was never that.
*  It just so happened being in that situation,
*  I went up, I ripped it.
*  And when I ripped it, the first time I went on stage,
*  I knew I was like,
*  this is what I will be doing for the rest of my life.
*  And I didn't say it, and with that thought, Joe,
*  I didn't feel like I'm gonna be rich.
*  I'm gonna be famous.
*  I'm gonna have a TV show.
*  For the first time I went on the stage,
*  only thing I wanted to do was be good.
*  That's almost to this point in my career now.
*  I'm like, if you good, and this applies to anything in life,
*  if you good at something and you're really good at it
*  and you're passionate about it and you study it
*  and you just live by that,
*  eventually you're gonna get the rewards of that.
*  I never was like, I'm gonna get a TV show.
*  I was just like, man, if I'm good,
*  I'm gonna be able to work this club.
*  If I'm good, I'll be able to work this club.
*  And then things will start happening for me.
*  So I think when I first started,
*  my friends and family, they was really, really rooting
*  for me to do it.
*  And the moment I went on stage, I was like,
*  this is what I will be doing for the rest of my life.
*  Wow.
*  And never thinking about it's gonna make me rich
*  or anything.
*  Do you ever feel guilty that you started off as a heckler
*  now that you're a comedian?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Yo, Joe, I gotta be honest, man, Joe.
*  I gotta be honest.
*  I like heckling motherfuckers, Joe.
*  I'm a natural born heckler.
*  In DC, we call it Jonin, right?
*  Jonin.
*  Why did it be called Jonin?
*  I don't know why they called it Jonin,
*  but it was just roasting.
*  It was the black way of saying,
*  if you wanna compare it, it was like roasting.
*  What an interesting word, Jonin.
*  Why did they come up with that?
*  Is he thinking that was a person
*  who was really good at it?
*  I don't know if it was a dude named Joan.
*  I don't know.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  I don't know the history.
*  A lot of black words,
*  I'm not gonna know the history of it.
*  You might wanna Google-
*  Have you ever heard that, Jamie?
*  Jonin?
*  Urban Dictionary.
*  Do you ever use it as a resource, Jamie?
*  Yeah, go for it.
*  Urban Dictionary has saved a lot of white people
*  that cook out to barbecues.
*  Yeah, but we, and I'm like, I used to love heckling.
*  I didn't know you couldn't heckle until,
*  in comedy, there's an unwritten rule.
*  They was like, you can't.
*  The rule is you can't-
*  Jonin.
*  Just put down and make fun of someone.
*  Quit Jonin on me.
*  You'll get smacked.
*  I wonder who Joan was.
*  Joan was a lady?
*  Joan?
*  No, I don't think.
*  You think that's it?
*  I know this fool ain't Jonin.
*  On, whoa, let me get that part, Joe.
*  Let me get the rest.
*  Get the rest?
*  I'll take the second half.
*  I'll take the second half.
*  You get the first half, I get the second.
*  Does that make sense?
*  Doesn't it?
*  It just could be someone just joked, like-
*  It was probably just someone named Joan
*  that was really good at insulting people.
*  No, no, no, I understand that sentence.
*  Where I came from, that's what it was,
*  the joke on the nigga.
*  That's what it was, Urban Dictionary nailed it.
*  That's what it was.
*  But it wasn't scripted, it wasn't like,
*  you had writers or anything like that.
*  It was just you.
*  In the moment.
*  In the moment, you look at that person up and down
*  and you just go for it.
*  And I used to, oh man, I used to Joan motherfuckers out.
*  And then the rule was in comedy,
*  you're not supposed to yell out in comedy,
*  you're not supposed to Joan or say anything
*  to another comment, which I fucking hate this rule.
*  Yeah, people don't like to be interrupted, Don-El.
*  I know, but don't-
*  Not everybody likes to do it your way.
*  All right, but Joe, have you ever felt,
*  and you have discipline,
*  you've been watching a motherfucker and you just like,
*  I just wanna say something.
*  You never felt like, I just wanna say,
*  I wanna wait till you get off stage,
*  I wanna just say something in that moment.
*  Especially if you've had a drink.
*  Yeah, yeah, I've been in that situation.
*  If you've had a drink, you're like, this is nonsense.
*  You would just wanna yell out.
*  And it's not to be nasty or nothing,
*  you just can't help it anymore,
*  you just feel like you gotta say something.
*  It's so funny, some years ago, me and Tracy Morris
*  was at a show, and me and Tracy Morgan started comedy
*  about the same time, and he was like,
*  man, I'm sick of these wack motherfuckers, man.
*  I just wanna say something.
*  I said, but you know, you can't heckle the comedians.
*  He said, we should do a tour, right?
*  Go all across the country to comedy clubs,
*  not to perform, just to heckle motherfuckers
*  from the seats, which I thought was a fucking
*  brilliant idea.
*  That would be so, you talk about something
*  that builds character.
*  It's almost like a roast battle.
*  Can you imagine putting mediocre comedians on stage
*  and having great comics in the audience heckle them?
*  Yep, you know what?
*  That would be terrifying.
*  It would be terrifying, but guess what?
*  I guarantee you, Joe, if you had 20 mediocre comedians,
*  one or two would stand out as the one that would break away.
*  And if you did something like that,
*  that's what you would be looking for.
*  Somebody's gonna say fuck it.
*  It's gonna be a shark tank.
*  So you'll recognize like real early on
*  what of your material's soft.
*  What out of your material's bullshit,
*  if you have to do it in front of people that you respect.
*  It's gonna make you step your shit up.
*  Or it's gonna make you have enough attitude and personality
*  to pull any joke off, because you know what it is.
*  Half the shit that you deliver, for the most part,
*  is stage presence.
*  It's stage presence.
*  It's how you respond,
*  how do you react to an audience coming at you.
*  Dude, David Tell was at the mothership this weekend,
*  and I saw him Sunday night.
*  Man, I don't know if there's a funnier person
*  that's ever existed.
*  You know what?
*  He's so funny.
*  Whenever I see his face, first off,
*  if you see David Tell's face now, you saw it 30 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Yo, he's like the white Morgan Freeman of comedy.
*  He's been how he looks forever
*  with a different color black hoodie on.
*  And it's so funny you mention his name,
*  because something came on my thread a day ago,
*  and David Tell's the type of guy,
*  not even hearing what he said, you look at him,
*  you say, I said I need to write more jokes.
*  You're like somebody, their mere presence
*  lets you know you gotta write more jokes,
*  because out of all the, and I've watched David Tell
*  for 30 years, I can't remember a time when
*  he hasn't went on stage with the mindset
*  of working on some new shit.
*  Always.
*  Always.
*  Always.
*  Always, and you're like how the fuck can he keep doing this?
*  He's just really focused on that one thing.
*  He used to be an alcoholic, and when he quit drinking,
*  he got way better when he quit drinking, man.
*  There's something happened to him.
*  Some comics, there's something that happens,
*  they're drunks when they're young,
*  and then they quit drinking,
*  and they're not as good anymore,
*  because they're not as fun.
*  Because when they were drunk, they were wild.
*  I've figured out a way to balance both.
*  Young drunk and older drunk.
*  But what I was gonna say is that it tells the best example,
*  because what he did was he quit drinking,
*  and then immediately got way better,
*  and just keeps getting better.
*  All that focus is now just on stand up.
*  I get it.
*  I think about that sometimes.
*  Dude, he was so good.
*  It was mind blowing.
*  He was just on fire.
*  He has a recorder, he plays a little flute.
*  I saw that, that's the clip that came up.
*  And I just thought the one part I remember,
*  he said, you have this instrument,
*  and he said, you have the head, the shaft, and the taint.
*  He was referencing the flute, or whatever it was.
*  Of course it was a penis, but I was like,
*  that was just, fuck, he's nice and shit at it.
*  He's got a formula in his mind
*  of how to make fun of everything.
*  And he's so in tune right now
*  that he can just kind of plug it into any subject.
*  And he just starts writing material.
*  And he's always working on it.
*  But he's not a fun guy to hang out with.
*  He's fun to hang out with.
*  What?
*  I like hanging out with him.
*  Man, I get nervous.
*  I feel like he's about to be on Law and Order or something.
*  When I hang out with Dave,
*  Dave will be talking to you,
*  then all of a sudden he just disappears.
*  But maybe it's just me, but yeah, he's not the party guy.
*  He was fun hanging out at the mothership.
*  Because we have the green room.
*  It's a nice relaxing place
*  where everybody can hang out together.
*  But he's an odd guy.
*  He carries around a flip phone.
*  He texts you with,
*  do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
*  like when you press four R's to get a...
*  Oh, he's doing the old school text?
*  Yeah, you gotta press it five times
*  to get an ass or whatever it is.
*  You remember those?
*  I remember those.
*  He does that.
*  That's how he sends you a text message.
*  That's crazy.
*  He's doing that with a flip phone.
*  That has kept him off of Diddy's yacht.
*  Yeah.
*  Not being connected.
*  Not being connected with too much communication
*  keeps you out of those back rooms
*  and keep you off those yachts.
*  That's hilarious.
*  You don't invite a person to the back room
*  or to a yacht if he has that phone.
*  Yeah.
*  Something is very suspicious about that.
*  You don't get invited to those parties
*  that get you movie deals.
*  That's just how they used to do Hollywood, man.
*  Old Hollywood is the shit.
*  Old Hollywood, that is exactly how they did everything.
*  Tarantino was telling us that one of the old producers
*  had a bedroom in his office.
*  So he had his office and then you go into his office
*  and he had a bedroom.
*  And the bedroom is where he would fuck all the starlets.
*  And so he was the producer
*  and if you're gonna be in his movie, he's gonna fuck you.
*  That's old school.
*  A bedroom.
*  Do you know how...
*  In his office.
*  You know how many women sitting there listening to us
*  saying bring back the good old days?
*  You know, as I mean, I do know you have some women like this.
*  Fuck that, I don't believe it.
*  But you do still have a couple of women like,
*  I don't wanna go to acting school.
*  I don't wanna study.
*  I don't wanna do anything.
*  I wanna get it popping.
*  Well, it seems like there was a real...
*  Look, no disrespect to actors, but there's a lot of them.
*  And there's a lot of them that probably never make it
*  that if they got the right breaks,
*  they could have been as huge as some movie stars
*  that exist today, right?
*  Wouldn't we agree on that?
*  I agree with that, with acting and it would stand out.
*  Yeah, but specifically for acting,
*  because there's a lot of people
*  that can just go into acting.
*  Like a lot of athletes have gone into acting
*  and done amazing jobs.
*  But not too many of them are good though.
*  But not...
*  You still see Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
*  Okay, who was in that Adam Sandler movie
*  with the basketball player?
*  Rick Fox?
*  I know Rick Fox was taking it really, really seriously.
*  Kevin Garnett, that's right.
*  He's in that Uncut Gems movie and he's fucking great.
*  He's not an actor.
*  It wouldn't work the other way.
*  You couldn't get a guy to do just stand up
*  and just be fucking great, who's never done stand up.
*  But you can get an actor out of a basketball player.
*  You could turn a fucking rancher into an actor.
*  You just teach him how to do it.
*  Some guys can do it.
*  What role did he play?
*  He played a basketball player.
*  Come on, motherfucker!
*  He played a dude who's ripping off Adam Sandler.
*  Did you hear what the fuck you just said?
*  But he played a dude who's ripping off Adam Sandler.
*  It doesn't matter, Joe.
*  I get that.
*  I always thought you was gonna say
*  he played a rocket scientist.
*  I'm just saying. So you're telling me, Joe, you're saying.
*  When he was going through, when he was doing his lines
*  to Adam Sandler, it's very realistic.
*  That he's a basketball player?
*  That he's not just a basketball player,
*  he's a basketball player that's ripping off Adam Sandler.
*  He steals a rock from him.
*  He doesn't wanna give a rock back.
*  There's no way that Kevin Garnett
*  could have fucking ruined his role.
*  Even Joe, listen to me.
*  Are you hating?
*  I'm not hating, what I'm trying to explain.
*  I feel like he's hating.
*  No, I'm not.
*  Don't start it, man.
*  Black Twitter will come for me.
*  I'm not saying that.
*  There is no way he could have been bad
*  playing a basketball player.
*  He was good, dude.
*  I mean, it's a good scene.
*  Okay, let me see.
*  I'm watching this.
*  Yeah, we can watch this.
*  I know, just fucking watching it.
*  We'll get in trouble.
*  All right, you can't watch it,
*  but I just wanna see him stand up.
*  Because right there,
*  I could see the dramatic side you're saying,
*  but when he stands up, he's playing a basketball player.
*  He is, but I'm telling you, it's not about that.
*  It's about gambling addicts.
*  The whole thing's about gambling addicts.
*  The whole movie's about gambling addicts.
*  It's a fucking amazing movie.
*  Right, I mean, I'm not even seeing the dialogue.
*  I mean, hearing it or anything,
*  I could see like his face looks abyssin,
*  but I still see a basketball Kevin Garnett
*  basketball player.
*  It's just tough.
*  Yeah, I know what you're saying, but he's...
*  And is that a Celtic, and it's a basketball ring.
*  Yeah.
*  Joe, he played a basketball player.
*  Yeah, but he played himself in this movie.
*  He's doing this thing where he's involved
*  in gambling addiction.
*  They're all just making crazy bets.
*  Dude, the movie will give you anxiety.
*  I'll check it out.
*  Like real anxiety, like,
*  oh, don't fucking do it, don't fucking do it.
*  So he was, and Kevin Garnett is a good guy.
*  I wasn't trying to shit on him, but just...
*  I know you weren't, I know you weren't.
*  What I'm saying is that like...
*  Because the minute you start, Joe, you say,
*  why are you hating the next thing you know?
*  The next thing you know, I'm being attacked
*  by every urban block in the country.
*  Joe Rogan was hating on Kevin Garnett.
*  Said the nigger shouldn't act,
*  he should just play basketball.
*  That was certainly not my words.
*  I know it's not your words, but it was a passion of my words.
*  Yeah, even that...
*  And that's how it starts.
*  Even that's not what you really meant.
*  But it's, but I'm saying is like,
*  I think out of all the things acting is probably,
*  even though some people are ingenious at it,
*  don't get me wrong, the most doable to a person.
*  Like that's the most...
*  I mean, it's, you're most likely to be able
*  to figure out how to do it.
*  Like you might not ever be able to figure out how to sing.
*  You know, you might not ever be able to figure out
*  how to do stand up, but you're,
*  you could probably figure out how to act.
*  Yeah, I would technically...
*  Just pretend.
*  Pretend and then you could get trained.
*  Yeah.
*  But I still think it's something inside of you as an actor
*  that takes you above the person, just like equally trained.
*  Yeah.
*  There's something that drives you
*  to wanna do something different
*  and make different choices as an actor.
*  Yeah, it's called being mentally ill.
*  Yep, and you're absolutely, I agree with you 100%.
*  Most actors are, have some type of mental disorder.
*  To think about it,
*  it's like you're playing make believe.
*  All the time, professionally. All the time.
*  And then if you get really famous for playing make believe,
*  at a certain point in time,
*  you're probably like, who the fuck am I?
*  Who actually am I?
*  Or who do I wanna be?
*  Yeah, I mean, but you think you are this person
*  because you are getting all this adoration
*  from all these people to see you
*  play different people in movies.
*  Like they don't even know you.
*  Right.
*  And then you like, what the fuck?
*  How weird is this world that I've created
*  where everybody loves me
*  and they like me to pretend to be different people?
*  Like who the fuck am I?
*  But at the same time,
*  you can give them whoever you wanna be that day.
*  I think we fucking, when we wake up in the morning,
*  we get in acting mode.
*  You go to bed, you fucked up about something
*  and you wake up in the morning like,
*  you know what?
*  Fuck that bitch, I'm gonna have a great day.
*  You're acting like you're not dealing
*  with what you did the day before.
*  I think that's a part of our life.
*  You, and I know this is a crazy question,
*  you've heard it before.
*  And it's like a generic question
*  when you have a comedian that's done some acting stuff.
*  Is it more challenging for you,
*  acting, or more challenging
*  as a standup developer in new material?
*  Well, it depends on what you'd be doing for acting.
*  Like I've never done a real dramatic movie
*  or a dramatic role in a TV show.
*  Everything I've ever done has just been silly.
*  So that's a different kind of acting.
*  Comic acting is, you know, it's just,
*  it's basically scripted shit talking.
*  Yeah, but at some point, even with acting,
*  there's a moment, this is the scariest part for me.
*  I can go in front of 25,000, and thank you,
*  you've provided platforms where I could do that many people.
*  I can go in front of 25,000 people
*  and it feels, and I can hear, and it feels amazing.
*  But it's the silence of when you know
*  there's like 150 people behind the camera
*  relying on what you do right now.
*  And that silence, quiet,
*  when everybody's completely focused on that one person,
*  one that got delivered that line and then action,
*  that shit is terrifying.
*  That shit is fucking, I'm telling you,
*  I've done shows with you and Dave
*  where you guys created platforms to come out in the arena
*  like I'm about to beat the fuck world up.
*  But the minute you say quiet, and you like,
*  and action, action, and then you gotta go.
*  And you gotta really rehearse that thing,
*  really know what you're saying while you're saying it
*  because you have to repeat these words in that order.
*  You're not freestyling.
*  You said earlier all the acting stuff,
*  you've been silly stuff.
*  I think maybe first four or five years of my career,
*  everything that I booked was dramatic.
*  Nobody thought I was a comedian
*  or if you wanna say a comedian, acting to the Chappelle show.
*  I had did like all of the law and orders.
*  I had did HBO's The Corner
*  where I played a heroin addict.
*  I think this was like the third audition I ever went on.
*  Third audition I ever went on, David Simon, Alex Foley.
*  She's a big, big time.
*  Foley, Foley's been a long time since I've been in New York
*  so I might be saying her last name.
*  But she cast all the wire, sopranos, all that stuff.
*  I went into an interview, I went into an audition
*  for the wire, I'm sorry, this was Jackie Brown Carmen.
*  Alex was when we went back and did The Corner,
*  but I mean the wire.
*  But for The Corner, it was Jackie Brown Carmen.
*  I went in for this audition.
*  The audition was as a heroin addict.
*  Charles Dutton directed this series.
*  It won three Emmys.
*  I played the character Brad.
*  That's my friend, Clark Peters.
*  He's an incredible, incredible fucking theater actor.
*  Came from the theater background.
*  So I'm doing audition, Joe.
*  I'm green as shit in audition.
*  And I'm like, man, I'm fucking this shit up.
*  I ain't gonna get this shit.
*  Jackie Brown Carmen said,
*  Donnell, relax, be calm, God is in the room.
*  You'll be okay.
*  And I fuck with God, but I didn't know
*  if God goes to auditions with you or not
*  and how much it would help, right?
*  And I did my lines again and I still thought I fumbled.
*  I was like, man, I understand her support or whatever.
*  I'm like, man, fuck this shit.
*  I just start saying anything, right?
*  Four days later, I swear, sometimes you do an audition,
*  you kind of feel when you're gonna
*  at least get a call back.
*  I get a call that said, you booked it.
*  I was like, what the fuck?
*  I was like, I could not believe it.
*  I was like, I don't know how the fuck that happened.
*  I was like, I know I wasn't prepared.
*  I was just saying anything
*  and I wanted to get the fuck out of here
*  and just go run right back to the stage.
*  Fuck acting, I'm gonna work on my jokes.
*  So we get on set, David Simon.
*  He's the original writer of the book, The Corner,
*  with another police officer.
*  It was, he did police journalism in Baltimore.
*  So I saw him on set and I was like, I got a question.
*  He was like, man, thanks for being part of it.
*  I was like, I got a question.
*  I just had to know, right?
*  I was like, I said, how the fuck did I get this role?
*  Right, I'm already booked.
*  I said, I swear, I thought I bombed that audition
*  and he said, Donnie, we like the way
*  you threw the lines away, right?
*  So if you mean not prepared, he said,
*  we like the fact that you threw the lines away
*  and he said, another thing,
*  you didn't feed into the stereotype of the guy's addiction
*  because everybody was going in there
*  was just going straight to the lean of the addiction,
*  the worst part of it, being high.
*  In our audition, they didn't wanna see that.
*  They didn't wanna see who is this person not being high.
*  And because I was off, because I said, fuck it,
*  I'm gonna just say it my way,
*  that's what fucking got me the role on that shit.
*  Well, that's probably the hardest thing to do
*  is to just say, just a free ball and being in,
*  just say, I don't even remember the lines,
*  but this is what I would fucking say.
*  But if you do that.
*  But some place, some platforms, they will allow that.
*  Then you get sticklers, like when you start talking about
*  HBO and those guys, it's like, they want you to say
*  every word that was on that fucking paper.
*  Yeah, but they also want someone who really sounds like
*  they can say those words.
*  Agreed.
*  There's things that a person has, like a type of charisma
*  that a person has, like a person like yourself,
*  that you either have that or you don't.
*  And if you have it, and you can deliver it in some form,
*  some way, you can be coached.
*  Someone can figure out, well, I'll help you memorize
*  the lines, we'll work through them together,
*  we'll go over things, but in the end, it's you.
*  It's you, you gotta go be you.
*  But not everybody can even pretend to be you.
*  Everybody don't.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  And everybody don't have the heart to take those chances
*  because, and I've never been trained, but one thing,
*  it's always resonated when you talk about acting,
*  is like, make a decision, right, and let them bring you back.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's better to go all out than to not do it and not,
*  when I was doing HBO's The Wire, there was one scene
*  when I get pulled over in the car,
*  and I got like $30,000 of, people don't know
*  if it's drug money, political money, or whatever,
*  and I get arrested for it.
*  And then the next scene, some kind of way,
*  they have to let me go with the money.
*  Basically, I came in with $30,000,
*  and I'm leaving with $30,000.
*  And I just said, I'm gonna do a little improv, right?
*  So there was like action, and when I left out the room,
*  I threw the money over the back of my shoulder,
*  and I said, some people got to have it.
*  Some people really don't let money change.
*  And then I looked back at the car, I said, oh, mighty dollar.
*  Everybody laughed, but they was like, nah,
*  we ain't gonna use that shit, bring it down.
*  But it's like making, at least they knew
*  that I would take the chance.
*  Some people, yeah.
*  Yeah, you'll be loose, and that's the thing.
*  It's like some people just can't be loose.
*  They just can't figure that thing out to be free.
*  It's always in their own way.
*  But I think for me, even with acting that's made it fun,
*  the times I get it, is that I've made enough success
*  in comedy and created a pretty good lifestyle off of that
*  that I don't have that pressure of having to book a role.
*  A lot of actors now, it's like,
*  if they gotta get this series, you know what I mean?
*  Just to continue the lifestyle they have.
*  So for me, acting's always been like,
*  oh, I'm just playing around, it's fun.
*  Get it, it comes and comes.
*  That's the best way to do it.
*  Especially if your standup is going well,
*  everything just sort of can be fine.
*  You don't really care if you're doing a movie here or there,
*  but if you were only doing movies,
*  those folks during the pandemic,
*  they kind of just went back to acting.
*  Because of a few comics that just stopped.
*  I was so happy that shit was over
*  because I got sick of these writers
*  that we never heard about doing spots.
*  It was like this guy wrote for a family guy.
*  You were like, where the fuck have you been?
*  You ain't been in the trenches like that.
*  People that realize they have fucking mortgages.
*  That's what happens.
*  And then they realize, oh my God,
*  I'm so connected to the TV system that if it goes down
*  because of the pandemic or another pandemic,
*  I don't work for a year and a half.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  I think that made people have to figure out
*  what their pivot was.
*  Yeah, well, you can't rely too much on a system
*  that doesn't give a fuck about you.
*  And a system that if you're paying attention
*  to where it's going,
*  a large amount of it is about to get sucked up by AI.
*  Like a giant chunk.
*  Of the entertainment?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I mean.
*  A giant chunk.
*  Tyler Pearl, it was a story maybe like three weeks ago.
*  And I think he was in the middle of either
*  producing a movie or doing something.
*  He was building an $800 million studio
*  and he paused the construction as soon as he saw us.
*  What is it called?
*  Sora?
*  Sora.
*  It can create entire scenes.
*  Entire scenes.
*  Entire scenes that look realistic.
*  Have you seen it?
*  I haven't seen it.
*  Watch this.
*  This video came out yesterday,
*  I think this is like a balloon head guy.
*  It's like a short film.
*  It, all these scenes supposedly I guess are made by Sora.
*  So this is all Aon.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  It's over.
*  Everyone has something unique about them.
*  I don't know about the audio that could be done afterwards.
*  It's just in my case, you know,
*  it's quite obvious what that thing is.
*  I am literally filled with hot air.
*  Yeah, living like this has its challenges.
*  Windy days for one are particularly troublesome.
*  One was the one time my girlfriend insisted
*  that I go to the cactus store
*  to get my uncle's area wedding present.
*  This is crazy.
*  What do I love most about my predicament?
*  Yeah, it's pretty well made.
*  And that's somebody just putting in the information
*  and that's being created.
*  Yeah.
*  The new world entertainment, Joe,
*  this is what my prediction is.
*  This is such a leap.
*  That is such a leap above everything else.
*  Now you add that too.
*  This is what's gonna happen eventually.
*  And this is not the right thing to say,
*  especially about Hollywood.
*  The idea of agencies, the idea of A&R,
*  all of those jobs are about to be gone.
*  And only thing you're gonna have is content creators.
*  And the content creators are gonna cut
*  the middleman of the agency out
*  and they're gonna go straight to the advertisers
*  and the people that pay the money.
*  You having to be connected with a certain entity
*  or a certain agency,
*  and they probably kill me after this, Joe.
*  I'm true, this makes me illuminati right now.
*  They gonna kill me, Joe.
*  Cat Williams and everybody coming for my neck.
*  I'm telling, it's gonna come where all of those things
*  that you needed to make it aren't gonna exist anymore.
*  And we're close to that right now.
*  Well, we already lost sitcoms.
*  So sitcoms were number one.
*  That was like a number one job for a comedian.
*  You get your own show.
*  Yeah, that was the only job you wanted.
*  That was the job that everybody wanted.
*  And then they had comedy movies.
*  Well, comedy movies have been drastically reduced.
*  So the sitcoms gone and then the comedy movies
*  have drastically been reduced.
*  But what did most people want that for, Joe?
*  What did the comedians wanted that for?
*  Two things, money and fame.
*  Yeah, because there was no social media
*  and there was no YouTube.
*  And so ticket sales were really dependent
*  upon you being on a television show.
*  100%.
*  Yeah, it was a big factor.
*  And this is why, you probably heard this.
*  And it's a conversation when it comes to,
*  especially when it comes to comedy.
*  You got the YouTube comedians,
*  you got the social media comedians.
*  Like comedy now has broken down into so many definitions
*  of what comedy is now.
*  When we first started, there was only one definition.
*  The minute you heard someone say comedian,
*  it was nothing but a guy who grabs a mic,
*  stands flat-footed and entertains the audience.
*  It wasn't a comedian on boats.
*  It wasn't that.
*  When you say comedian, you just associate it with-
*  Comedian on boats?
*  You know, I mean, just like,
*  no disrespect to the cruise guys.
*  Is that what you're talking about?
*  Yeah, they find their lane and they love it.
*  But that's a tough life, man.
*  That's a tough life.
*  That's a tough life.
*  Trapped on that boat telling them some fucking jokes.
*  But then some people got mouths to feed.
*  Some people like this.
*  That is what it is.
*  They look at the level of competition.
*  They look at this, they be like this.
*  You know what?
*  And those guys, they're six figures.
*  Yeah, they make six figures.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  They do, most of the guys that do it,
*  it's, I don't, it didn't get to a point-
*  I've talked to guys that didn't like doing it.
*  Yeah, but they-
*  They're like, it's very, kind of depressing
*  for some reason.
*  Your first year or so, it's probably not,
*  especially if you're doing like $30 spots in Brooklyn here.
*  Like when I, that was a come-up when I started.
*  It's like, oh, you on cruise ships.
*  I mean, you're getting- Really?
*  Oh yeah, it was, because we didn't really have a lot
*  to look up to other than just making money off of it.
*  You know?
*  So that was, it was a regular job in stand-up comedy.
*  But the point I was making about, even with that,
*  the different definition of community and young people,
*  and they always, they break like all the old heads
*  have a way of thinking, yeah, this and that.
*  The thing that you have to credit
*  is the work ethics you have to have
*  to get to a certain level.
*  As if you want to say a social media comedian,
*  or it's a certain level, it's a certain work ethics
*  you have to be to do to get consistent with that.
*  But the problem is, what some people have issues with
*  is like, yeah, but some of them not that good.
*  You know how hard it is to get good at something
*  when you're already a millionaire doing it
*  at whatever level?
*  You know, what pushed us when we were coming up
*  was that if I get good, I can get the money.
*  But now it's like, they got the money,
*  so what is the urgency, unless you get that one or two
*  that's really, really care about the craft,
*  what is the, who cares about being good at it
*  when the end result is I'm getting paid off the shit?
*  Well, you always want to be good at what you do, don't you?
*  Some people, but the level of getting good at now
*  is different.
*  Today, people getting good at knowing algorithms.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  They get good at knowing what the system is,
*  which is fucking incredible.
*  If you put talent on top of that, you know, it should be.
*  Yeah, if you're a smart person,
*  you know how to really utilize the system.
*  I want to say manipulate, but that's the wrong word.
*  It really is utilized.
*  Utilized.
*  Because it's just, like Mr. Beast, that's a perfect example.
*  That guy figured out like how to make the right captions
*  and how to make the right image that you click on
*  for the YouTube videos, the right title.
*  And then he figured out how to just keep dumping money
*  into his product.
*  And he figured out exactly where the algorithms are,
*  and he has it translated into different languages.
*  And that's a definite, that's what I'm saying is,
*  that's the skill set that's going to get rid of a lot of jobs.
*  That guy's a unicorn though.
*  But here's the thing, I feel like if you have AI,
*  like whatever the next generation of chat GPT is,
*  you could be able to devise a very effective business plan
*  that like really made sense.
*  The AI would sort of guide you step by step.
*  Like this is what you're going to do to achieve success.
*  It'll probably even break it down.
*  If you write for 20 minutes every day,
*  that will increase your time of material
*  by 50 minutes over the course of the next 10 months.
*  And if you like do all the calculations,
*  you're like, holy shit, is that real?
*  And if you really thought about it that way,
*  like through artificial intelligence,
*  you let it guide your career,
*  it would probably do a fucking amazing job
*  of like putting you into the perfect position to be.
*  I mean, if artificial intelligence could really-
*  So we're going to be auditioning against motherfuckers.
*  An artificial intelligence guy, you like,
*  you sending your tape in,
*  and then they got a motherfucker that's auditioning like this.
*  Hey, I need Joe to be a police officer,
*  arrest these guys for stealing.
*  Don, we have to realize we're that close to them
*  they're being fake people.
*  We're that close.
*  Hopefully I'm dead before they show up.
*  No, it's not.
*  Cause I already deal with regular fake people.
*  No.
*  Now we got artificially created fake people?
*  Oh, Hollywood is fucking dead.
*  They're in trouble.
*  Oh, Hollywood's dead.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  For real though, Hollywood's dead.
*  Just looking at that movie.
*  You buried it, you helped bury it.
*  I didn't do shit.
*  Yes you did.
*  What did I do?
*  I just abandoned ship.
*  You helped bury it.
*  You helped, you showed motherfuckers something you could do
*  that they probably didn't think you could do.
*  Go somewhere, post up, do your shit,
*  and create a whole fucking comedy community in Austin.
*  Yeah, I didn't think I could do it either.
*  You knew you could do it.
*  I did know I could do it.
*  Yes you knew you could do it.
*  I did not know I could do it.
*  And you did.
*  I just did it.
*  That's why I'll tell you.
*  And you have, you doing it, a lot of people doing it.
*  But I did your club, the mothership.
*  And it's like, anybody, not anybody,
*  if you have enough money, you can build a nice club.
*  It's a nice club, state of the art, whatever.
*  But it doesn't make it a comedy community.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  That's gonna be the challenges of all these people
*  that open up comedy clubs and stuff.
*  Dave has opened up one, I think Mike Epps,
*  there's a lot of them popping up.
*  And I think that's the dope thing.
*  But the thing is, it's a difference
*  between having a comedy community.
*  Yeah, you have to do that on purpose.
*  And that's one of the things that we did
*  when we opened up the club was set up a whole,
*  these are the nights you're gonna have open mic.
*  We're gonna have comedians audition to be door people
*  so that they'll be able to see guys like David Tell,
*  who's just there this weekend.
*  And then you'll have this very clear pathway.
*  There's open mic night,
*  the talent coordinator will be there,
*  he'll be able to watch you.
*  Maybe he can even give you some tips.
*  Other comics can watch you.
*  They see you working the door.
*  You get to see all this great comedy.
*  You get to be around all this great comedy.
*  And then there's a lot of places to go in town.
*  And we'll let you punch out.
*  Seven days a week, right?
*  They let people punch out.
*  Like a comic has a set down the street,
*  they can punch out, go run down the street, do a set,
*  come back to work. That's how it's supposed to be.
*  It's just seven days a week, right?
*  Yeah, we're seven days a week.
*  That's how I gauge whenever I go,
*  and you'll never see it anywhere.
*  Two nights open mic nights, too.
*  I always gauge a club.
*  Not gauge it, but you can tell how successful a club is
*  if they can run fucking seven nights a week.
*  Well, it's, you know, it was the perfect timing.
*  It's just a weird coincidence of all these things happening
*  that open to all these doors at exactly the same time.
*  Like, it's like going down the street
*  and you hit every green light, like magically,
*  and it just goes.
*  You know, it's a system in New York.
*  If you, on those streets,
*  Second Avenue, any of those streets,
*  if you drive 28 miles an hour,
*  you will catch every light from like 20th, 30th Street
*  to about 115.
*  That's a fact I know you didn't know, but I tried it.
*  I've heard that.
*  Yeah, if you do it,
*  I think it's 28 miles an hour,
*  you, it's a straight shot.
*  Wow.
*  A couple of cats and dogs will get ran over in that process,
*  but as long as you might maintain that consistency
*  of 28 miles an hour, you won't stop.
*  Hmm.
*  That was a fact that I know you didn't know.
*  I had heard that before.
*  I had heard that from cab drivers.
*  Is there anything you haven't heard, Joe?
*  At this point in time, I always think that,
*  but then Jonin comes along and throws me for a loop.
*  I had 16.
*  It's 16 the last time I was here,
*  you didn't know what a hot 16 was.
*  That's right, I didn't.
*  Yeah.
*  But you asked me, you asked me about this suit.
*  It looks sweet.
*  And as I'm watching myself from the camera,
*  I'm like, did I go overboard with this suit?
*  No, no, no, no, no, you look great.
*  I wish I'd known, I would've worn a suit too.
*  I like wearing a suit.
*  I know, I remember when we was doing-
*  Yeah, we did those arenas.
*  Arena shows, and your whole energy
*  changed when you had a suit on.
*  Like I did on my sped, I said, stop my feet.
*  You start stomping your feet.
*  And you said, you could do your set,
*  but it's just something about,
*  something that's classic about being able to do
*  stand up in the suit.
*  There is something about it.
*  And that's how I felt, even when I did New Day.
*  First off, this was my third time shooting this special.
*  I told you the story.
*  Yes.
*  And I remember, and I was really getting stressed,
*  because every time I saw you, you would be like,
*  when is the special coming up?
*  When is the special?
*  I'm like, I don't know.
*  I fucking shot this shit, I don't know.
*  First time I did the special during the pandemic,
*  at the end of the pandemic,
*  when the clubs still had all this COVID protocol and-
*  They had masks on.
*  Yeah, masks on, then vaccination cards,
*  have you been tested, and what shot you had,
*  Johnson and Johnson and all that shit.
*  We did it in North Carolina.
*  Outback was already against it,
*  because the venue I chose, it held 600 people.
*  I think it was the Fillmore Theater, 600, 700 people.
*  And we had a sale of 700 people.
*  But then when Netflix was like, ah, where's your card?
*  Where's this?
*  It went down, the first show went down to like 250 people.
*  Oh, they had to have vaccine cards to get in?
*  All that shit.
*  Which means now in the back of the show,
*  you gotta put a black curtain.
*  Oh no.
*  Now you're looking at a half-filled audience.
*  They got masks going and shit.
*  Oh no.
*  Did the show, first show went well.
*  Right, first show went well.
*  And then Dave was like, because he produced it,
*  Dave said, you know, if we don't get it,
*  we can shoot it again.
*  I'm like, motherfucker, ain't no time to shoot this.
*  We don't get it this time.
*  Second time at it, I caught a stand-in-o,
*  Stan Latham going crazy, Ricky Hughes going crazy.
*  We were like, oh, we got it, we got it.
*  And we announced that my special was gonna come out
*  the same time we announced
*  the earthquake special was gonna come out.
*  A week after that announcement, Dave calls me, he says,
*  Don-El, I wanna shoot your special over.
*  I'm like, you're not supposed to insult the thing.
*  You tell a committee you wanna shoot it over,
*  the first thing you think, what, it wasn't funny?
*  That's the first thing.
*  He was like, I can put you in front of any audience,
*  you're a ripped-in-row.
*  He said, but doesn't make it a great special.
*  He set off everybody and the umbrella of the home team
*  that people are really anticipating
*  because your connection with that show is you.
*  If we're gonna do it, we gotta get it right.
*  It was tough because I'm like,
*  oh, this is gonna be the joint
*  that give me a platform for people to see me do stand-up.
*  But we basically scrapped the shit.
*  He said, Don-El, you had too much COVID jokes in there.
*  And think about it, if I were to shot a special
*  with Mad Skinning, it automatically dates you to 2020.
*  Yeah.
*  So when you turn around,
*  it's like, oh, this shit was doing a pandemic.
*  How wild was the pandemic?
*  I miss it.
*  I was thinking about the other day.
*  I miss it, man.
*  I miss not having to be around a lot of motherfuckers.
*  I missed how people appreciated simple things.
*  I miss how when you had a bubble,
*  you could block all this negative, all the haters out.
*  You weren't allowed to come inside the bubble.
*  Give me six feet, bitch.
*  Give me six feet, the bubble.
*  And inviting who you wanted.
*  I miss how people appreciate life.
*  I think we should do a lockdown week,
*  a worldwide lockdown week, once a year,
*  where the whole fucking world just shuts the fuck down.
*  Yeah, that would be great,
*  except you can't tell people to shut things down
*  because then you're gonna give the power to the government
*  to shut things down whenever they want for a week.
*  And then they might decide two weeks is better,
*  maybe a month.
*  You can't give them the power to shut things down.
*  If people decide to not do anything.
*  Well, we should vote so we could vote on a lockdown,
*  like national lockdown day.
*  You don't want them to take away freedom from people.
*  I don't wanna take away freedom.
*  If people wanna do it, they should be able to do it.
*  If y'all agree to do it, do it on your own.
*  Nah, fuck that.
*  Fuck that, Joe.
*  Joe, what happened when we started making people do stuff?
*  Guess what happened?
*  When you make somebody do something,
*  when you make somebody wash their hands,
*  when you make somebody give you six feet,
*  when you make them do something,
*  it forces some type of change.
*  I'm not saying forever,
*  but I think that we should have a joint
*  where we just lock down everything for like a fucking week.
*  Everything is dead.
*  That shit was fun.
*  Some people died.
*  Not that many.
*  In comparison to people that lived.
*  Not already sick.
*  Point?
*  It is a disease that killed people for sure,
*  but it's a disease that killed people with,
*  what was the percentage?
*  It's like a large percentage of them
*  had four comorbidities.
*  Oh yeah?
*  A large percentage of the people that died from COVID.
*  Four.
*  Four different things that are killing you.
*  Just say it, wrap it up.
*  It's like that came along to an already compromised human,
*  which is not to say that we shouldn't try to help
*  compromised humans,
*  but I'm saying that it's not what they were selling it as
*  or what people were terrified that it was gonna be.
*  Yeah, but I know it was, I mean for me.
*  But it was so weird what it did for us, man.
*  Do you remember those days at Stubbs?
*  I went to Stubbs the other day to see the Black Keys,
*  and it just brought me back to those days at Stubbs.
*  We did those shows there.
*  It was like, there was a wild, crazy feeling
*  about doing something when no one else was doing anything.
*  It was fucking, I got high off of this shit.
*  It was exciting.
*  We were still doing comedy,
*  and comedy was shut down everywhere.
*  We were still doing comedy,
*  we were still eating with groups of people.
*  We were hanging out.
*  That's what I'm saying about appreciated.
*  Then even, but a lot of people thought we were reckless.
*  But you know, every part of this, it was protocol.
*  It was like, hey, every part of it, it was protocol.
*  You weren't gonna be around anybody
*  that hadn't been tested, period.
*  And that's, it was just something about it.
*  Even when we saw each other, it was like, oh shit.
*  We doing, we got excited about doing regular shit.
*  Even when all of our crew caught COVID at the same time.
*  It was like a chicken pox party.
*  We went down from a team of 24, and every day,
*  this is when I knew it was getting bad,
*  because I used to plan lunches for everybody,
*  and we had lunch like at 12 o'clock every day.
*  And they were like, I wonder what we're gonna have for lunch.
*  It'll be 24 people.
*  Then once the bubble popped, one day it was 22, it was 20,
*  it was 19, it went down to 12,
*  to four people you had to fend for yourself.
*  The whole fucking crew caught it.
*  And this is pre-vaccines, this is pre-...
*  That was right, it was right when vaccines was about to pop,
*  because I had somebody, I know this sounds so ghetto,
*  I had somebody that could get me to Johnson & Johnson
*  on the low.
*  On the low.
*  People were excited to get it at the beginning.
*  All of it?
*  Yeah.
*  I got it, I got it quick too.
*  I almost got it.
*  Yeah?
*  I got lucky.
*  See, now you like-
*  I got lucky, I dodged that.
*  Now, now, I'm wondering, ever since I got it,
*  I'm waiting for some shit to happen in my body,
*  that I can contribute to that shit.
*  Well, a lot of people can.
*  It did something to a lot of people.
*  It's got a very high rate of side effect.
*  Why you fucking with me now, man?
*  It does.
*  Which one?
*  I think all of them.
*  I think, and I don't think any of them are good for you.
*  I didn't...
*  So what's gonna happen to me?
*  I think if you were an old person,
*  and it was the first go around of COVID,
*  it probably would help you.
*  But I think there's a lot of problems with that thing.
*  What's been the-
*  Well, there's a lot of side effects.
*  I mean, there's...
*  The craziest thing that's going on right now
*  is the increase in all-cause mortality.
*  That's the crazy thing.
*  Due to the vaccine?
*  Yeah, there's an excess death.
*  There's like an excess death number increase
*  that's pretty...
*  If you were a statistician,
*  if you're a statistics person,
*  and you were looking at indications
*  that something went wrong,
*  you would say, well, was there anything
*  that caused these people's bodies to change
*  where we're getting this large number of excess deaths?
*  In some people, it's as many as 40% in some age groups.
*  40% excess deaths.
*  And what type of shit?
*  I think it just means like 40% more people die
*  than normally do.
*  Basically, that's what it means, right?
*  Black.
*  Jamie?
*  Black.
*  Excess deaths?
*  Black?
*  Everybody.
*  Everybody.
*  And a lot of it is cardiac stuff.
*  Cardiac stuff went way up.
*  But a lot of people got it
*  and nothing happened to them and they're fine.
*  I feel like that was a personal attack on me.
*  You were like, Don-El, you got the jab twice.
*  Listen, I would have got it.
*  I was ready to get it.
*  I didn't get it just because they couldn't do it.
*  I had to go to a clinic or the hospital or wherever.
*  And then I said, I'll get it when I come back next time.
*  And between that time and me coming back next time,
*  they had already pulled it.
*  They pulled it because of blood clots.
*  Yeah, I got it because of full work.
*  I know this sounds crazy, but you couldn't,
*  if you were working as a working actor,
*  you couldn't work.
*  You couldn't work.
*  You couldn't work.
*  So I know some people made it.
*  I mean, I know people are like,
*  yeah, you compromised your body.
*  And then some areas people think it's like,
*  oh, it's the white man trying to control you.
*  But it was at one point, it was like,
*  if you were trying to work, you wasn't working
*  unless you had a vaccination.
*  Yeah, you weren't going anywhere.
*  You weren't flying anywhere.
*  Yeah, it was a real issue.
*  And there's still, there was a lot of countries
*  that until recently you had to have a vaccine card,
*  including America.
*  You had to have a vaccine card to get in
*  unless you walked across the border, of course.
*  Shout out to the Mexicans.
*  Then you come right in.
*  They had, where was it?
*  Where was it?
*  In Canada, Australia, they had the biggest,
*  I think they were the most tight.
*  Australia was crazy.
*  They were putting people in camps.
*  If you were sick, they'd take you,
*  you could have been fine.
*  And you couldn't travel, period.
*  You just were there, right?
*  And if you got sick and then they put you in that camp,
*  you can't go anywhere.
*  And there's fucking armed people out there waiting for you.
*  And they didn't have that much,
*  they didn't have that much death either, so it worked.
*  Well, no, no, it didn't work.
*  First of all, it's a terrible idea
*  to just round people up and make them go to camps
*  because they're sick.
*  You don't allow them to stay at home.
*  You determine where they can move and not move.
*  You were arresting people for wearing masks outside.
*  None of that is scientific.
*  None of it works.
*  There's never been a respiratory disease.
*  You don't think lockdown helped us at all?
*  No, not at all.
*  So you think it would have just been passing
*  if we wouldn't have had to lockdown and all the protocol?
*  Maybe it slowed the rate of people getting it.
*  Maybe, you could say that.
*  And maybe for older people,
*  it protected them from being in contact with people
*  that would give it to them, okay?
*  Maybe.
*  But in terms of what it did to the economy
*  and what it did to the small businesses
*  and all the small restaurants and how many people...
*  Shut it down.
*  How many people went into drug addiction
*  because their fucking whole life,
*  everything they worked for fell apart?
*  How many people lost everything
*  through no fault of their own?
*  People that have been working for decades in restaurants
*  and small mom and pop shops, they just all went under.
*  None of them could handle that year and a half
*  where you couldn't work at all.
*  It doesn't make any sense,
*  any sense that anyone could have ever watched that happen
*  and see that 70% of the restaurants
*  were crumbling in front of them
*  and not to make some sort of a correction.
*  It doesn't make any sense that they didn't.
*  I see the aftermath.
*  When I go, I was insane.
*  Whenever I go to these cities
*  and you look at the downtown area.
*  So that's all from the lockdowns, man.
*  That's a big part of it.
*  Where people can't work for a year and a half,
*  you're gonna have so many more homeless people.
*  You're gonna have so many more people that are in despair.
*  So many more people that become alcoholics.
*  Remember all the people that were drinking like crazy
*  during the pandemic?
*  Was that was the best time to drink?
*  This lady made a video.
*  She was jogging down the street,
*  taking a video of all the different recyclables
*  that people had out.
*  It's all just bottles of tequila and bottles of wine.
*  During the pandemic?
*  Yeah, people are going hard.
*  Yeah, I was a part of that bubble.
*  That bubble.
*  It was a good bubble.
*  You never felt the freedom when we all came together?
*  Here's the thing though.
*  The lockdown was a terrible idea.
*  It was terrible for everybody.
*  It was terrible for kids.
*  It was terrible for everybody.
*  It might have, you can make an argument
*  that it might slow the spread of the disease.
*  But there's just so much they did
*  to suppress alternative methods.
*  But they had to do,
*  I think we had to do something.
*  Yeah, well, what they should have done
*  is listen to all the doctors
*  instead of just the doctors that wanted to vaccinate people
*  because there was a lot of doctors
*  that were prescribing alternative treatments.
*  There was different remedies.
*  There was a bunch of different things they did
*  that helped people that got sick,
*  especially monoclonal antibodies.
*  There's a lot, and then they stopped giving those to people.
*  They stopped making them accessible.
*  Once you were in the hospital, they wouldn't let you have it.
*  There was so much shit that went on
*  that was just, if you wanted to be really,
*  really clear with what you're looking at,
*  you'd have to say, God, I think this is motivated more
*  by money than taking care of people.
*  So much of it, so much of it.
*  100%, Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson,
*  they all came up.
*  And you can't even hate them
*  because that's what they do.
*  That's what they do.
*  That's their business.
*  So we need a pandemic or something catastrophic like that
*  to happen before a big business can make more money?
*  No, we need AI.
*  So somebody sat there.
*  So did Rick say?
*  AI is gonna put the kibosh on all of it.
*  AI is going to, what is going to?
*  I think we're gonna have president AI.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think we're gonna realize people are too emotional
*  and easily distracted and too corrupt.
*  And just like the percentage of corruption
*  is costing this amount of money.
*  The incorrect allocation of money to this and that.
*  Yeah, AI.
*  AI president. AI president, yeah.
*  Not kidding.
*  A lot of people with actually
*  what you're smoking right now, Joe.
*  No.
*  So what you do, you vote for this?
*  How do you, how does it?
*  Well, here's the thing.
*  If they really want complete total control,
*  they'll trick you into telling you
*  that you don't need to vote anymore
*  because AI is going to equitably distribute all wealth,
*  all social services, all housing.
*  Everything's gonna be even for everybody.
*  AI knows how to do it.
*  It's gonna stop all international conflict.
*  It's gonna have a perfect carbon neutral existence
*  while powering everything up.
*  But it has to take control.
*  But somebody has to be in control of what you ask.
*  Not necessarily.
*  So it's just gonna be anybody.
*  It's not necessarily.
*  No, not necessarily.
*  Nobody's gonna be able to control the information
*  to give AI to do everything you just said.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  What happens is AI achieves what they call sentient AI.
*  So what it is is at a certain point in time,
*  if artificial intelligence gets good enough,
*  it's going to be autonomous.
*  It's gonna be able to control itself.
*  And it's gonna be able to make better versions of itself.
*  It's not gonna be as simple as you made a thing
*  and now I programmed into the thing
*  what the parameters of this thing are.
*  And now this thing can act like a person.
*  No, you turn it into a life form.
*  And then you say you have the ability
*  to create better versions of yourself.
*  Well, that thing is-
*  You're steering the shit on me right now.
*  That thing's gonna be a god, okay?
*  That thing that's gonna be a god,
*  that thing might be four years away from us right now.
*  Like no bullshit.
*  Like 2029, it might be a real thing by then
*  with the way technology is moving so fast.
*  Like we didn't even think about AI being a threat.
*  You know how many deadbeat dads are gonna leave
*  if you could do an AI version of being a dad?
*  They're gonna be like, fuck it, I'm outta here.
*  You go fuck with Junior, I'm gone.
*  I can't believe, but you can believe-
*  Human beings are gonna live in alternative realities.
*  It's not gonna be as simple as now all of a sudden
*  there's artificial intelligence.
*  It's artificial intelligence that can give you
*  whatever elixir you need to keep you happy.
*  And that's what it's probably going to do to people.
*  It's probably gonna figure out a way to sedate people.
*  So how are people gonna make- Keep them calm.
*  And let them stop breeding.
*  So how are people going to be able to work
*  and provide for themselves?
*  It's just gonna be a different skillset.
*  It's gonna be different type of jobs.
*  How are humans gonna be able to compete with AI?
*  Well, we're not.
*  That's the thing.
*  It's not possible.
*  If they reach a certain point, so if you just think about,
*  you know what an exponential increase in technology is?
*  I don't.
*  Exponential means it's not as simple
*  as like one plus one equals two.
*  You gotta think that with each,
*  you know how they do like a funnel
*  and they have a quarter and they spin the quarter
*  around the funnel and at the bottom
*  it gets faster and faster and faster.
*  That's how exponential increase in technology works.
*  With each invention, it makes all these other inventions
*  and they all accelerate.
*  And as they do it, it happens so fast and so quick
*  that this exponential thing is hard to understand
*  because it's not like each step is one more.
*  It's like earthquakes.
*  Like a 7.1 earthquake is like way stronger than a seven
*  and they just get bigger because it's exponential.
*  That's the same thing with technology.
*  It's gonna happen so fast
*  that the increase in power and its ability
*  to do whatever it wants to do is gonna happen so quick
*  that once it becomes alive,
*  it's just gonna make better versions of itself
*  like immediately.
*  But what do we do?
*  There's nothing we'll be able to do to control it.
*  We are fucked.
*  That's what I was trying to say.
*  Because there will be no more jobs.
*  When you first started this shit,
*  I was like every time you build up and said,
*  what the fuck you said, I said we are fucked.
*  We're fucked.
*  We're fucked.
*  We're fucked.
*  They're already having them work as kitchen assistants
*  where they talk to you in your kitchen.
*  They got robots.
*  I went to a robot restaurant the other day
*  and a robot motherfucker pulled up with the noodles
*  and all that type of shit.
*  Jesus.
*  I go to studios.
*  I go to like Good Day Pittsburgh and all this type of shit
*  and where you used to go in those places
*  and see like 12 cameramen is one producer
*  and all the cameras are fucking robotic.
*  Didn't we learn from iRobot?
*  No, we didn't.
*  Why didn't we learn from those movies?
*  Why didn't we learn from Terminator?
*  Because we-
*  What the fuck is wrong with us?
*  Because we thought it was just a movie.
*  Why didn't we learn from George Jetson?
*  Yo, that was my state of the art shit.
*  I'm so old, Joe, that when I see,
*  I remember when thinking about George Jetson,
*  my mindset was like, that will never fucking happen.
*  And my son has a phone with a goddamn video camera
*  because we don't believe this shit is gonna happen.
*  Well, it happened so fast.
*  That's another example of exponential increase
*  in technology.
*  That's why, Joe, I fuck with the woods.
*  That's why, Joe, I said fuck Hollywood.
*  I'm going from the streets to the creeks.
*  Get yourself a satellite phone.
*  I said I'm going from the hoods.
*  Get a satellite phone.
*  Nah, I ain't doing nothing.
*  You got all this survival shit.
*  Get a satellite phone and go to the woods.
*  And then what, who the fuck you gonna call?
*  Just call whoever the fuck you want.
*  Just you.
*  You're the only one.
*  Hey, that's out there.
*  We got that photo out there.
*  This decided I'm going from the streets to the creeks,
*  from the hoods to the woods, from the hoards to oars,
*  from Adidas to Tevas, Joe.
*  My whole mindset, my whole thing is a fucking new day.
*  Fuck Hollywood.
*  God.
*  I don't think it really exists for us anymore.
*  No.
*  Comedy Hollywood, like Comedy Hollywood.
*  Comedy Hollywood is a ghost town.
*  It's not there anymore.
*  You are an example, and there's a lot of other examples of,
*  you can literally make Hollywood
*  wherever the fuck you want to make Hollywood.
*  But it's not even.
*  It's not Hollywood at all.
*  The only reason you wanna be in Hollywood now
*  is for the parties, Joe.
*  And nobody's going to those parties anymore.
*  You gotta tell them no.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  There's a lot.
*  It's hard not to think about it,
*  but there's a lot of people,
*  that's not just, that's not just in the case with Diddy.
*  It's not like this shit that's happening
*  with him right now.
*  This shit be going on in Hollywood forever.
*  I'm not saying it's right,
*  but at some point you gotta say no.
*  That's the simplest thing to tell somebody.
*  The best vice.
*  All right, this guys, get ready,
*  bring a baseball bat sticking to your ass
*  with a line of cocaine.
*  What are you gonna tell them?
*  Ha ha ha.
*  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
*  Boop, boop, boop.
*  You gotta tell them no.
*  Bro, that's some next level shit.
*  What, the parties?
*  Yeah.
*  It's not, Joe, you don't know about the parties, Joe.
*  I don't go to those parties.
*  I didn't say if you fucking went to the parties,
*  I said do.
*  I hear rumors.
*  I hear whispers.
*  Joe, you don't know about these parties.
*  You don't know about these parties.
*  You don't know about the parties
*  when the motherfucker come up to you,
*  you with your girlfriend,
*  and they like, I like both of you.
*  You don't know about these parties?
*  You never heard about these parties?
*  No.
*  You never heard about,
*  you never heard anybody come up to you
*  and they say shit like this, Joe?
*  So we think you're cute.
*  We.
*  Get it?
*  You never heard about these parties, Joe?
*  Now the question is,
*  how many of them are out there?
*  And do you think that's a Hollywood thing?
*  I think that it's definitely more prevalent in Hollywood
*  than in like Oklahoma,
*  but I'm pretty sure these type of parties
*  and things exist.
*  The problem is, man.
*  Just deviance.
*  It's just deviance.
*  And guess what we wanna do?
*  For the most part of our life, Joe,
*  you know who we wanna dance with?
*  The devil.
*  Most people have more fun
*  with the devil than with God.
*  God is the party pooper.
*  Is this the part where you announced
*  the opening of your new church?
*  You know what, Joe?
*  Joe, listen.
*  You might not agree with this,
*  but I thought about it.
*  I wanna go.
*  I'm not saying I wanna be a part.
*  You can do it.
*  I'll get it.
*  Yo, help me.
*  Kinnison did it.
*  At AI Church, I can get my own church,
*  have my own people to come.
*  Cause I want to have a church where people
*  like fuck with God,
*  but don't really fuck with God.
*  Right.
*  And let me get you.
*  You wanna try to put them on the path.
*  I wanna people that fuck with God,
*  but don't fuck with God.
*  And the reason why, what I'm trying to say, Joe,
*  is like I fuck with God and I don't fuck with God.
*  And the reason why I say I don't fuck with God,
*  like I never abuse it.
*  I'm never like, oh God, please.
*  This light is about to turn red.
*  I can't eat this $75 ticket, God.
*  Please help me.
*  I don't use God for shit like that.
*  I would never be like, oh God, oh God.
*  It's 12 o'clock.
*  I hope the Burger King drive-through line is still open.
*  I really need a Whopper my way, God.
*  Please help me, God.
*  I don't fuck with God like that.
*  When I fuck with God it's like this.
*  My lady's pregnant.
*  God, please give me a healthy baby.
*  That's reasonable.
*  That's the, I know I'm not gonna start a church,
*  but the idea of getting people to feel like that,
*  think about like, that's how I feel.
*  That's gonna be my change.
*  I'm gonna start a church
*  that fuck with people that fuck with God,
*  but don't fuck with God.
*  Specifically.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you think?
*  I like it.
*  You definitely can be a preacher.
*  I like the way you're dressed.
*  I see you in a private jet.
*  I see you in front of a Rolls Royce.
*  You just see me in front of a Rolls Royce.
*  Don't do that, you start scaring me.
*  Don't do that.
*  I see you in an arena with your big smile on the face.
*  I don't want that.
*  You can do it though.
*  Come on, if that fucking, that guy,
*  what's his name that does it?
*  Joel, come on, man.
*  You don't think he'd dominate in that world?
*  No, but I do think that there's a place for people
*  that there has to be a church or something
*  for people that aren't perfect.
*  There would be a cool-
*  I think that people try to go for a lot of things.
*  I think a lot of people's religion or anything,
*  they think that you have to be perfect
*  to be part of it or to understand it,
*  and I don't think that's the case.
*  I do believe it's something that makes you feel good.
*  People make the argument, is it real or is it not?
*  But it's something that's spiritual
*  that makes a person feel good, want to do better,
*  and want to live the right way.
*  So if I had a church, that's, if I was to even,
*  we're joking about it, but that would be like
*  the type of energy that I would fuck with.
*  Well, people would like something like that,
*  because there's a lot of people that don't want to go
*  to like a traditional church,
*  but they're interested in the idea of it.
*  The way it's been described to me, the best way,
*  I think Jordan Peterson was the first person to tell me this,
*  that he, even if you don't necessarily believe in God,
*  if you live like you believe in God,
*  you will live a better life.
*  If you follow those principles and just try to believe,
*  you'll live a better life.
*  Even if you think in your logical mind,
*  which is really fascinating, right?
*  Even if you think in your logical mind,
*  what is the possibility that one grand creator
*  has this insane connection to everything that happens
*  all throughout the universe,
*  and there's some sort of a divine plan
*  to every word you say and everything you do
*  and every event that ever takes place in your life
*  and everyone's life around you?
*  Yep.
*  That's a lot of people like, I don't know.
*  But if you do believe that.
*  If you do believe that and you live like that,
*  you'll have a better life.
*  But I think everybody needs to believe in something.
*  Something, yeah.
*  You gotta believe in something.
*  And that's why, from my point about the devil,
*  everybody wanna dance with the devil.
*  Devil has the best parties, but then after a while,
*  think about it, if your phone ring,
*  this is like back in the day, your phone ring, right?
*  You answer the phone.
*  You see on the call with that idea,
*  you see it's the devil, it's the devil, right?
*  And you let it ring to the last fucking ring,
*  you finally pick it up, what's up?
*  And the devil is like,
*  man, we about to have this banging ass party.
*  We got all these bitches, man.
*  We about to get it popping.
*  We got some good food.
*  It's about to be jumping down here.
*  You'll be like, fuck, I'm coming, devil.
*  Right, Jeffrey Epstein.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  To the island.
*  Yeah, yeah, like that.
*  Exactly.
*  You're like this, I'm going, right?
*  Now you getting dressed, you getting dressed,
*  you're thinking about all this party about to be popping.
*  You get dressed, then your phone ring again.
*  And it says God.
*  The first thing you're gonna look at God is like,
*  God damn it.
*  Fuck!
*  I can't believe it.
*  If God's calling and you just pause before you answer,
*  he's gonna be mad.
*  If you just look at it and go,
*  oh shit, should I?
*  But that's what you're gonna be.
*  I'm gonna let this go to voicemail.
*  You know how to, bad motherfucker,
*  you have to be like God, go to voicemail.
*  Yeah, that's very funny.
*  No, to put God on hold is,
*  as many people try to call into God to put God on hold,
*  it's like, oh, this dude's got some balls.
*  It's one of the things that keeps me on iPhones
*  is random FaceTimes from friends.
*  Out of nowhere?
*  Out of nowhere.
*  Just to, what, to validate the friendship?
*  No, it's just a fun thing.
*  Oh, just to FaceTime?
*  It's fun when someone FaceTimes you out of nowhere.
*  You're like, oh shit.
*  But then the worst is like,
*  you're anticipating to pick it up
*  and then don't pick it up.
*  Oh, yes. And then you're like,
*  oh, you fucking asshole, you don't know him.
*  Well then you gotta figure out
*  what way your relationship stands.
*  Nah, I don't wanna judge you.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Some people have bad days.
*  I don't wanna judge you after that.
*  No, I don't judge nothing.
*  I assume, also I assume people like you or me
*  get too many fucking text messages anyway.
*  You can't even keep up with everything.
*  It's not possible.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  There's not messages on Instagram and Twitter.
*  It's not possible to keep up.
*  And then I'm older.
*  I get voice messages.
*  People think I'm gonna answer a voicemail message.
*  They fucking lost it. Get the fuck out of here.
*  That means I gotta, do you even know how?
*  Or long ass emails?
*  Like come with this.
*  Why do you have so many links in this email?
*  Remember we used to record, too many, just too many links.
*  It's too many, like voice, it used to be,
*  I don't even know how to program a voice recording.
*  Hey, this is Don-El.
*  The, the.
*  How do you even do that?
*  I guess you just press a button on your phone.
*  Does anybody know the button?
*  It's gotta be like one or nine or something.
*  I got used to be, we used to, when we used to do it, Joe,
*  we used to have slow music in the background.
*  Music in the background, yes.
*  And we say shit like, hey, right person, wrong time.
*  Ah!
*  Leave your number and I'll be sure to call you back.
*  Everybody try to be cool. Leave it.
*  And if you don't, I mean, it's like you didn't even call.
*  We used to have music in the back.
*  Like that was the shit.
*  So remember answering machine messages?
*  Have your favorite song in the background?
*  Yeah.
*  You have that, yo, do, do, do, do, do, do, yo, this is Don-
*  do, do, do, all that stupid shit.
*  And you really didn't have to have your own voice.
*  You could just have music.
*  Like so much. And then you got creative.
*  If you really knew people, you're like,
*  you could get somebody like, yo, could you leave my,
*  my voice recording for me?
*  But nobody used the phone for fucking,
*  nobody talks on the phone anymore.
*  I remember really clearly when you first could use music
*  as an option when someone calls you.
*  Or in the background music.
*  Yeah.
*  They used to know when you were on hold at a hospital,
*  but they had it where you could pick it.
*  And then you would let people go to,
*  you would let them go to voicemail just so they could hear
*  how cool your music was in the background.
*  Couldn't pick up. You had to let them know.
*  I got music in the background of my shit.
*  Yes. I would love it when my phone would ring
*  and you could hear songs.
*  Now I would think that's annoying as fuck.
*  Back then it was so novel.
*  But who actually picks up a phone when it rings?
*  We don't even- Not anymore.
*  Communicate like that anymore.
*  No, very rarely. It's all text.
*  I do like to make phone calls when I'm in my car though.
*  I'll call a friend if I'm in my car.
*  Only when you think about them, but not for anything.
*  I do it just to say hi.
*  Cause it's a good way to say hi.
*  Cause if I'm driving to work or driving to the club
*  or driving somewhere, it's like, I got dead time.
*  I'd like to say hi to somebody.
*  I told myself this year, I was like,
*  you know how we always, when you say,
*  oh man, something happens, you're like,
*  I was just about to call that person.
*  Yeah.
*  I was just thinking about you. You called me first.
*  I've started to do that when I get that impulse,
*  like somebody pops up.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like, let me just call this motherfucker.
*  Just like on some, you came across my brain.
*  Instincts.
*  Yeah.
*  Like when I told you I wanted to get one of those,
*  when I texted you, I said,
*  I want to get one of those cyber trucks.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, black people always looking for a hookup.
*  I was like, I know you got a hookup.
*  Get me on the list, son.
*  Have you drove that car?
*  I have not driven it.
*  I saw it in person.
*  I've seen a bunch of them now.
*  I saw it in person a long time ago.
*  It's a real trip, man.
*  It really looks like something from the future.
*  On the inside of it, right?
*  I can imagine.
*  It's probably like, simulator or something.
*  It's crazy.
*  The whole thing is crazy.
*  It probably doesn't have a regular steering wheel.
*  You can get a regular steering wheel.
*  Or it's like-
*  It's one of the options.
*  Yeah, it's called, what's that called?
*  A yoke.
*  You can get a yoke, which is, I have it on my Tesla.
*  I'm not really a big fan of it.
*  I have the Model S.
*  It's just one unit?
*  No, it's like you're holding on.
*  It's like you're doing a Formula One car or something.
*  It's just not good for parking.
*  You like it?
*  Spin it around?
*  It's weird for spinning the wheel around.
*  It's fine if you're just on the highway.
*  I don't even look at my fucking reverse cameras.
*  The wheel's the way to go.
*  What is that?
*  That's the Cybertruck one?
*  I don't know if you can get the wheel on the truck,
*  can you?
*  Well, that is a wheel.
*  Oh, I guess it is.
*  It's like a mixture of both.
*  No, it's definitely not.
*  It definitely has a top.
*  The whole thing about turning is you want a top.
*  Yeah, yeah, the flap.
*  Yeah, that'll be fine.
*  You won't even notice the difference.
*  But I don't know if that's ideal.
*  That's how the old Tesla had it, like that.
*  I must have my old one.
*  Or that's the, no, that's the Cybertruck's version?
*  Oh, it is.
*  What didn't, I didn't have a,
*  I had something that looked like that,
*  but with a top on it.
*  What was the S before that?
*  I don't know anything.
*  I know X model.
*  There was the, what is the car?
*  What is it, P100D?
*  Yeah, when I had a P100D,
*  I felt like they had it all down right.
*  There was a blinker switch on the stock, you know?
*  Which everybody knows.
*  I just, I don't give a fuck, Joe.
*  I just want to know how the sound system,
*  that's how you sell cars to black folks.
*  The sound system's good in these things, man.
*  That's it, so.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the only way to do it.
*  Do you ever drive an electric car though?
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird, because you want to go vroom, vroom,
*  and you like just whoosh, you'll blow that shit up.
*  Yeah, but I wanted to at least drive.
*  When I was thinking about it, that'd be something fun to do.
*  It's a fun thing.
*  They're big as shit though.
*  That's a big truck.
*  I heard the wait in this is like a year, right?
*  Is it?
*  Yeah, that's what the streets were saying.
*  The streets.
*  Yeah, the streets very important.
*  You got to listen to the streets.
*  If you don't listen to the streets,
*  you could be in a big truck.
*  Waiting list of a year.
*  In one year, what are the odds civilization exists?
*  It's not 100%.
*  You got me planning, but I'm like.
*  It's not 100%.
*  Just give me a good, Austin.
*  In one year.
*  Joe's trying to kill me off.
*  Just give me a good 20.
*  In one year.
*  You got an artificial dad.
*  Yeah.
*  One year I'd say we're like 50-50.
*  But the thought of that is like very interesting,
*  and I think you're 100% right.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially with this election coming up.
*  Trump's going to win.
*  I'm not saying I'm a supporter,
*  but I cannot see how he's not going to win.
*  I don't know if they're really going to have Biden
*  against Trump.
*  I'm not convinced of that.
*  What's the options?
*  He resigned.
*  With this suit, I feel like I should be able
*  to answer that question.
*  You should be able to answer that.
*  You should be on CNN.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like.
*  Did Kamala steps up, but she doesn't have to.
*  Look at any moment.
*  First of all, the stress of being the president
*  must be insane.
*  Insane stress, right?
*  It makes everybody look old.
*  He was already very old,
*  and not just chronologically,
*  but biologically.
*  People keep pointing to his age and Trump's age.
*  It's like stop doing that.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  I know what you're trying to say.
*  They're similar in chronological age,
*  but they're definitely not similar in the effect of decay.
*  Like one guy is at least.
*  Trump feels like he's sharp.
*  Reasonably sharp.
*  Reasonably sharp.
*  But there are reasonably sharp businessmen
*  that exist that into their 90s
*  can have great conversations with people.
*  They're sharp.
*  But Biden has problems.
*  There's problems there.
*  It feels like his motor skills are off.
*  It feels like you couldn't.
*  It feels like.
*  Yeah, to deny that,
*  it's just you're not helping anybody.
*  Do you think his mind is still alert?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  No, I think he forgets all kinds of crazy things.
*  I met Muhammad Ali in the airport
*  maybe five or six years before he passed away.
*  And it was interesting because I was dating this chick.
*  I knew she was young because I said,
*  we were walking and she said,
*  oh, there go Muhammad Ali.
*  And she kept walking.
*  I'm like, fuck you mean?
*  The Arab Muhammad Ali or Ali Muhammad?
*  She said, Muhammad Ali.
*  I'm like, where?
*  I saw Muhammad, I just, like anybody would do.
*  I was like, oh shit.
*  It's Muhammad Ali.
*  And I walked, he was in one of those,
*  you know, like the cars, the electric cars.
*  Yes, yes.
*  And I was, everybody was going up to him
*  and I was like, I just want to shake your hand.
*  Right?
*  I said, I just want to touch you.
*  And his hands was like shaking,
*  but his eyes were alert like motherfucker.
*  You know, like, you know, keep it cool.
*  But what I said, like Biden,
*  his motor skills seem like he's off.
*  But I wonder if his mind is still sharp enough
*  to go at another four years.
*  The answer's no.
*  I think that'd be.
*  It's not fair.
*  It's not fair to him.
*  But all those people under him,
*  they should be asking him to step down
*  and let a democratically elected person
*  that can actually lead the country take his place.
*  But who is that?
*  But they're not gonna do that
*  because they don't really care.
*  They just want to win.
*  They want to stay in power.
*  They don't care when they don't have anybody.
*  Well, they want to stay in power.
*  Listen, if they didn't want to stay in power,
*  if they brought in Gavin Newsom,
*  Gavin Newsom, once he gets in,
*  he brings all of his own people.
*  And now there's different people.
*  And a bunch of these people get fired.
*  A bunch of these people are gone.
*  A lot of the people that work for the other administration,
*  you gotta realize that he's that old and that fucked.
*  You know how you get rid of-
*  Who's running the thing?
*  The people behind him are running the thing.
*  You know how you get Biden out, Joe?
*  How do you get Biden out?
*  Don L?
*  Have him sign for bad boy with Puffy's bad boy.
*  He probably could talk men to it for the country.
*  If he signs the bad boy, it's over.
*  But I don't know how anybody's gonna beat Trump.
*  Yeah, it doesn't seem like they're going to.
*  They keep trying to arrest him.
*  And the crazy thing is this dude has been very competitive
*  and with, for the most part, no news coverage.
*  I haven't seen a commercial-
*  Well, the news coverage is always he's going to jail.
*  That's the news coverage.
*  But the news coverage-
*  Which gets his base super excited.
*  The thing is they got lied to for so long
*  that they don't know what to believe anymore.
*  So in the early days, it was Russia.
*  Trump was colluding with Russia.
*  There's a Russia collusion.
*  Russia, Russia, Russia.
*  Turned out to not be true and they couldn't prove it.
*  And so these people talked about nothing but that for years.
*  So now when he's going to jail and getting mugshot-
*  Well, Trump, they arrested him.
*  He didn't go to no jail.
*  Like jail?
*  I don't know where the fuck he went,
*  but they took a mugshot photo of him.
*  Where the fuck they took him?
*  They probably brought that shit to where he was.
*  I think they had him into a courthouse or something.
*  When Jamie comes back from the bathroom, we'll ask,
*  but I think he had to go to some courthouse
*  or something like that to get arraigned.
*  So when stuff like that happens
*  and people have already gone through years
*  of the Russia bullshit, they don't believe you anymore.
*  And so now-
*  No, I don't believe.
*  The people that really follow him believe,
*  not anymore, they believe everything.
*  They believe him.
*  But they don't believe the media anymore
*  when I'm saying you, the media.
*  Jamie, where did they take Trump
*  when they took that mugshot photo of him?
*  Where was he?
*  Was he at a jail?
*  Was he at a courthouse?
*  Where was he?
*  He was in a side room in his house.
*  He was in a bar and I'll go.
*  He has golf shorts on.
*  Yeah, with a green screen.
*  He had a green screen background.
*  Fulton County Jail in Atlanta.
*  Fulton County Jail in Atlanta.
*  Oh, he did a bit.
*  They called it, oh, he went to jail jail.
*  Yeah, jail jail.
*  But he wasn't there long enough to get like a sandwich or-
*  No, but he was there long enough for them to take
*  one of the greatest photos in the history of the world.
*  Look at that photo.
*  That looked like his regular campaign photo.
*  Well, a lot of people used it.
*  They used it.
*  Look at it before-
*  Look, it is crazy, man.
*  It's crazy that they're going after him
*  for what they're going after him for.
*  You know, the whole thing is so transparent.
*  Like the people that support Donald Trump
*  want to support him to the day that they die.
*  Yes.
*  You're not going to change it.
*  And as many times you indict him or whatever,
*  all it does is invigorate that base
*  and those people, they get more excited and more excited.
*  Well, people think that they're going to change your mind
*  because they don't like something,
*  but that doesn't always really work.
*  And a lot of times it has the opposite effect
*  because they don't like why you're trying
*  to change their mind and how you're trying to distort
*  the facts of things and only concentrate on negative things
*  just to try to change a perspective and to lie
*  and gaslight and tell me that Biden's sharper than ever.
*  Like when they start saying things like that,
*  okay, now everyone knows you're bullshitting, okay?
*  Now you're just playing a game.
*  So if you've agreed that sometimes
*  you're going to play this game,
*  we're going to say things that don't make any sense
*  that you know aren't true and that I know aren't true
*  and you're going to put them in the newspaper
*  and you're going to put them on television.
*  But can you still respect a person?
*  Because not the issue, but so much of this is the part.
*  Me?
*  Not you, but so much that's so fucked up about politics
*  is that when people personally can't stand someone
*  because of what their political views are.
*  Because of their politics.
*  That's silly.
*  In this business right here,
*  that's a hard thing to subscribe to.
*  That's not a good mark of a man, for sure.
*  A man that can't have a calm, relaxed disagreement
*  with someone, with another man,
*  that's not a good sign of your self-control.
*  That's probably not a good sign also
*  of the why in which you engage in conversations.
*  Because there's just far too many people
*  that engage in conversations just trying to win.
*  Because they've got it in their head
*  that they have an idea and they want to argue their idea
*  better than your idea.
*  It's like a verbal sparring more than-
*  It's like a baby mama joke.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  I'm sure.
*  They just want to get that argument and win it.
*  I don't give a fuck. They want to win it.
*  Yeah, so that's a real problem that people have.
*  It's a real problem.
*  Because it doesn't do anybody any good.
*  It doesn't do you good even if you win.
*  And more people are going to try to do it back to you.
*  It doesn't, it's way better to just not be-
*  Not engage.
*  Or not be attached to your ideas
*  to the point where you identify with them.
*  But instead, just say, why do you think that?
*  And then they tell you-
*  This sounds like therapy in regard to co-parenting.
*  That's what I'm doing right now?
*  That's what it sounds like.
*  It's so fucking relatable.
*  Well, it should be that way with all human beings.
*  You're so lucky you don't have to co-parent.
*  I'm very lucky.
*  But also, I think with co-parenting,
*  it's uniquely stressful.
*  Because then the mother starts dating another guy,
*  you start dating another woman.
*  But what about a v-
*  Wait, why does she gotta date first?
*  Why does she gotta date first?
*  It's probably hard.
*  Why?
*  Why is it always the woman that gets it?
*  I'm trying to be politically correct.
*  Oh yeah, that makes sense.
*  The point is, it doesn't do anybody any good,
*  but it's also so emotionally stressful, right?
*  I agree with, but I'm going to tell you,
*  this is my thought on co-parenting.
*  The first part of beginning of co-parenting,
*  the first thing you as a co-parent,
*  first thing you do, this is what makes the best co-parents.
*  First thing is, that person can't get happy before you.
*  That would ruin you on the inside.
*  So both people are trying to find happiness
*  before the other one.
*  You don't want that person.
*  That's the beginning of co-parenting.
*  You're like, fuck that, why didn't it work?
*  And then as it goes on for a while,
*  then you start thinking about what is in the best interest?
*  What's the best interest for the kid?
*  And that usually is not the first beginning of it,
*  because at the beginning of it, you don't give a fuck.
*  And it's also like an emotional challenge.
*  It's a challenge to just try to get better control
*  of your ability to communicate and just into, you know.
*  I think you, and I know a lot of people in this situation,
*  you grow into it.
*  I never thought in my situation that would be,
*  I remember I was dating this woman some years ago,
*  and her parents had split up when they,
*  their brother, sister were like really, really young.
*  And at the time we were dating,
*  their family used to get together for holidays.
*  They weren't seeing each other anymore.
*  They would get together holidays.
*  They'd get together for Sunday dinner.
*  And I was like, they must still be fucking or something,
*  right, because I thought that that's the only way.
*  Then I realized that even with the situation with my son,
*  I realized they were just trying to give the kids
*  as much family and as a regular life as they possibly could
*  and not being together.
*  And that experience made me wanna be
*  a better co-parent with my son.
*  And we finally at the point where we get along
*  and we know the best interest at the end of the day
*  is what we do for Austin.
*  That's great.
*  Yep.
*  It's totally doable.
*  And people change.
*  They change as they get older.
*  People evolve.
*  You get better at communicating.
*  That's, again, that's what I was saying
*  about arguing about ideas.
*  It's not a good sign of a man.
*  Like getting angry, like verbally abusive, shitty, insulting.
*  Like what people tend to go to right away.
*  Because they're just trying to win
*  and they're trying to break the person down
*  as they're trying to win the argument.
*  And I think it's real tempting.
*  And it's tempting to people
*  because people like to be good at stuff.
*  And if you think you're smart
*  and you think you got somebody
*  and you're good at something and you can chase it down.
*  I mean, I don't argue.
*  If I ever argue, it's because I know I'm gonna win.
*  That's the only time.
*  If there's a chance.
*  But you argue if you're right for sure.
*  Yeah. You're right.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's been in relationships.
*  If I argue, it's just not like I'm flying off the top.
*  I'm like this, I have everything to win this argument.
*  That's why I don't get a lot of arguments
*  because a lot of them I can't win.
*  So I'm like, I'll just stand back and just take the abuse.
*  I don't mind arguing
*  but sometimes when you have to say something
*  because someone's saying something ridiculous
*  and you gotta go, dude, stop.
*  That doesn't make any fucking sense.
*  Stop saying that.
*  I agree.
*  That's how I love it.
*  Because otherwise sometimes people will like,
*  they'll pollute the environment with a bad idea.
*  I've had that situation in black podcasting.
*  I had a situation and I know I would leave names out.
*  But the thing, like you said, with someone,
*  to hear, you know, as a comment to hear,
*  you're not funny.
*  In the common world of comedy,
*  that's like the N word of comedy.
*  It's also-
*  It's very triggering.
*  I feel like it's a cry for help.
*  Almost always.
*  Almost always.
*  I mean, there's some shit that people say,
*  there's a lot of shit Cat Williams said
*  that turned out to be true.
*  But I think there's this quote,
*  is that,
*  all criticism is a tragic result of unmet needs.
*  That's a part of the quote.
*  But that part of the quote always resonates with me.
*  It's like, that's what it is.
*  Like these people,
*  the reason why they're lashing out and saying,
*  you're not funny,
*  like there's not more productive shit to do.
*  Like you're trying to attack someone
*  who's getting more attention than you.
*  Yeah.
*  Like why?
*  But I know that's a painful-
*  That's not real.
*  That's not real.
*  It still hurts, Joe.
*  Not to-
*  To you, Joe.
*  But you shouldn't feel it at all.
*  I mean, Joe, I still read fucking comments, man.
*  Ah, they're still going from the RZA episode.
*  They won't let go.
*  They won't.
*  That's the first thing I told Donnell
*  after the RZA episode,
*  I said, don't read the comments.
*  And that first thing I did,
*  it's just so hard.
*  It's just hard.
*  Cause it be going so well, Joe.
*  It'll be going so well.
*  He's a beast.
*  I love him.
*  Top five.
*  And then boom.
*  He got you.
*  And the whole fucking day is shut the fuck down.
*  Yeah, you don't want that in your life, Donnell.
*  Don't listen.
*  I was-
*  I could get to that, but I don't listen.
*  But this is something you have to take into consideration.
*  I think that,
*  especially with someone like you as a public figure-
*  Motherfucker still think I ran off him.
*  That was a dress.
*  Aw, Brody.
*  I texted him the other day, he thanked-
*  Aw, that was a good one.
*  Yeah, I liked that photo, Brody.
*  That painting.
*  We gotta put that back up in here.
*  Yeah, Vanessa, you made me stay.
*  Yeah.
*  You said fuck my kid.
*  You said fuck my kid.
*  I did not say that.
*  I said I wanna go home to see my son.
*  I definitely did not say that.
*  You like, you got your kid, baby mama, RZA.
*  I said, dude, the RZA's coming next.
*  Do you wanna hang out?
*  Cause we were just having a fun time.
*  But the minute, Joe, the minute I said,
*  man, I haven't seen my son in two weeks,
*  you're supposed to have been like this.
*  Oh, get out of here, go do that.
*  You heard me say I wanted to see my son.
*  And you said, I don't know, it's the RZA.
*  And I stayed.
*  Yeah, that was easy.
*  Just to get abused.
*  The devil just whispered in your ear.
*  Yeah, I told you I'd dance with a married man as well.
*  Just to be abused.
*  Listen, man, the podcast was fun.
*  It was fun.
*  It was a great podcast.
*  But these comments, motherfuckers, Joe,
*  they fucking evil, man.
*  But, Donnell, it doesn't matter.
*  It doesn't matter.
*  They won't be invited to my church.
*  They're welcome to their opinion.
*  Everybody's welcome.
*  They're not coming to my church.
*  You don't want that in your head.
*  I don't, but I can't stay away from it.
*  Fuck them.
*  They should all be able to just.
*  Fuck them, fuck them, fuck them.
*  Just let people go.
*  Just don't read it.
*  It's not good for you.
*  Even the good stuff's not good for you.
*  Even the blowing you up.
*  That's the good shit.
*  That's the love shit.
*  I love that.
*  Top five, Mount Rushmore.
*  Hell yeah, killed, murdered.
*  That's how I want to be supported.
*  When we be on artificial intelligence,
*  I want them to be on my dick.
*  It will be.
*  I want them to be like, oh, best, top fives.
*  Oh, shit, you gotta see them underrated.
*  I don't want to hear none of that shit, lame, cringe.
*  That's kind of like what we were talking about earlier.
*  Like, if artificial intelligence gets to the point
*  where it can formulate a game plan
*  and you actually follow that game plan,
*  if artificial intelligence says,
*  Don-El, we have sat down and devised a strategy
*  to radically improve your popularity and your ticket sales.
*  This is how we're going to do it.
*  I love it, yeah.
*  It lays it out for you.
*  It tells you what to do.
*  And you're gonna develop a YouTube video
*  every three or four months and put out a clip
*  and do a this and.
*  I would love it.
*  I bet it would work.
*  I think creativity at this point
*  has to come from a person,
*  especially your kind of joke writing,
*  the things that you make fun of,
*  things that I make fun of,
*  the things that are unique to whoever the individual is.
*  The only thing that's gonna save us,
*  and that's the people, if it's possible,
*  is that now, oh my God, they're gonna be making robots.
*  Seeing a motherfucker live,
*  it's gonna be something about seeing somebody live.
*  I think that's the only thing that's saving TV
*  is sports events.
*  That's the only thing people really, really tune into
*  is what do I have to watch in that moment.
*  Yeah, if you're watching a football game
*  that is actually happening,
*  that there's a scramble, the ball gets thrown,
*  someone's trying to catch it.
*  If you're watching a fight, dudes getting knocked out,
*  you're watching actual things
*  that are happening in real time.
*  But if you're not, man,
*  and within four or five years,
*  everything's gonna be generated from a computer.
*  And who knows how you're gonna interface with it?
*  Because they just started releasing
*  these Apple Vision Pros.
*  I saw those.
*  Which are crazy.
*  You can walk around in them.
*  So you can be sitting in your living room
*  with a giant screen and move things around
*  and swipe things to the left and swipe things to the right.
*  So you can actually see stuff like glasses.
*  Like I can walk, I can see like this.
*  You can walk around.
*  Yeah, and then you have things that are in front of you.
*  So you could sit down and have an enormous movie screen
*  in front of you and watch Avatar in 3D
*  and just sit there like, whoa.
*  Or you can have a fucking spreadsheet
*  and open it up.
*  You can open up a website.
*  You can fucking play video games.
*  And just by with your head in your hand.
*  That's fucking crazy.
*  I don't want to, I'm gonna stick out.
*  Five years from now, Darnell, with AI?
*  Think about that with AI,
*  where it just brings you into a world
*  where you literally feel like you're in that jungle
*  in Avatar with the flying plants and all the Navi
*  and all the fucking, those crazy animals on the ground.
*  Imagine like that being around you.
*  Like indistinguishable from reality.
*  Smells, taste, everything.
*  All programmed into your mind,
*  syncing your brain up with whatever this code is.
*  You're not recruiting me.
*  You're not recruiting me.
*  And I'll tell you what, you know where I'm gonna go.
*  I'm gonna go to the woods.
*  I'm gonna go to the river.
*  I would say you can have your fucking 3D glasses.
*  I'm gonna go to the river.
*  I'm gonna crawdad fish.
*  I'm gonna take my son and let him ride ramps
*  in the backyard.
*  I'm gonna do regular shit
*  while you're dealing with all of this 3D AI shit.
*  And I'm gonna get fucking David Taylor's phone
*  where nobody can get in touch with him.
*  Look at that.
*  If your girlfriend's yelling, you can just come and grab.
*  That guy's just watching YouTube.
*  She just keeps staring at it.
*  She's yelling at him and he's watching basketball.
*  He's gonna disappear into the woods.
*  Oh, now he's in the woods.
*  Look at that.
*  That's where I'm going.
*  Come on, how beautiful is that?
*  It's kind of amazing.
*  I'm going to the woods.
*  The real woods.
*  I wanna go to the real woods.
*  And again, that's one of the things I like
*  about Yellow Springs, Ohio.
*  And being there is disconnecting
*  and going and doing some regular shit.
*  The only thing that's gonna save us
*  from all of this alien shit and everything,
*  you know, Joe, is this.
*  Sleeping in the woods?
*  That's not sleeping.
*  That's chilling.
*  Chilling.
*  That's plants.
*  That's some regular shit.
*  The only thing that's gonna save civilization
*  is the woods, Joe.
*  That's it.
*  Doing regular shit and appreciating regular shit.
*  You're halfway there.
*  You like the woods to kill shit,
*  but have you ever thought about living there?
*  No, I do.
*  I like the woods, period.
*  I don't just like the woods to kill shit.
*  You don't do shit but kill shit in the woods, man.
*  No, no, I go in the woods.
*  When was the last time you did?
*  Sunday.
*  Non-killing something in the woods.
*  What was it?
*  When hiking.
*  Did you have a bowl?
*  Did I have a what?
*  A bowl with you just in case.
*  No, I had my dog.
*  No, I didn't have a bowl just in case.
*  Just, did you have a knife?
*  I always have a knife on me.
*  Okay, so you was prepared.
*  No, no, I was hiking.
*  You was, that's what it's gonna save?
*  I was outside in nature having a good time.
*  That's beautiful.
*  That's the only thing, it may sound simple,
*  that's the only thing that's gonna save us
*  is getting in touch with nature.
*  That's the only motherfucking thing.
*  I disagree.
*  I think we're fucked.
*  I think getting in nature is gonna be good
*  for the individual, but I think for the species,
*  I have a feeling we're the last of the Mohicans.
*  I'm not trying to save everybody.
*  Just me and my boy in the fucking woods.
*  Just me and my family.
*  You guys will be fine.
*  I feel like the human race, as this thing comes alive,
*  I think we're greatly underestimating
*  the impact that it's gonna have.
*  We not underestimate,
*  because you talk about it all the time
*  and you know everything about it.
*  I learn more about what I'm praying for in 10 years.
*  I definitely don't know everything about it.
*  In fact, my knowledge of it is pretty limited.
*  A lot of it is speculative and unfounded.
*  For the average person that's never gonna challenge you,
*  that still has a flip phone,
*  and that part of it, you know way more.
*  And what you're saying is very fucking believable.
*  What was disturbing to me was I had a conversation
*  with Ray Kurzweil, who's one of the big names
*  in artificial intelligence.
*  And he's all super rosy about the future of AI
*  and that it's inevitable and that we're all gonna do this.
*  And I'm like, well, what if someone gets in control of this?
*  Someone, there's gonna be somebody in control.
*  And that's what scares the shit out of me, dude.
*  And no one seems to have an adequate answer for that.
*  And Elon is terrified of that too,
*  which really makes me scared.
*  If that fucking dude's scared of it, okay.
*  So that means that they know
*  that we are building the type of technology
*  that at some point we won't be able to control
*  and take over us.
*  It's inevitable that that's gonna happen.
*  Or we merge with it,
*  or we scale up our ability to control it
*  as it gets implemented.
*  So even though it's more intelligent than us,
*  we can still control it.
*  But we're always gonna have a nutty professor.
*  Well, the thing is if it becomes a living thing, right?
*  So what they're doing right now is they have,
*  everything exists in an actual computer.
*  There's nothing that exists in a physical form
*  except these robots that they're using
*  to clean up kitchens and shit.
*  Have you seen those yet?
*  No, I haven't.
*  It's disturbing.
*  The biggest part is-
*  You talk to the robot,
*  and the robot can pick plates up
*  and put them in the drying rack,
*  and it talks to you.
*  And I look at it and I'm like,
*  okay, that is just a really crude, shitty,
*  like I compare it to the Model T.
*  Like that's a Model T.
*  And if you look at the exponential increase in technology,
*  like look at, what was the first year you got a phone?
*  What year was that?
*  Phone, it had to be probably,
*  probably like 82, 83.
*  Damn, you had an early one.
*  I was front-line, I was a drug dealer.
*  You had an 82?
*  Yeah, that was the thing.
*  You had a, oh man, you get pictures of-
*  Did you have the briefcase phone?
*  I had the briefcase joint, yeah.
*  I had one that was built into my car in 88,
*  but then I couldn't afford that.
*  I didn't get another phone after that.
*  Nobody got it, it was about minutes.
*  You couldn't afford that shit.
*  It was too expensive.
*  My shit didn't work, I just had it.
*  But I had a job back then too.
*  But then I got another one, I think in 94.
*  I think it was 93, that's right.
*  And it was a Motorola StarTac.
*  That was a shit, I remember that was the coolest shit
*  you could have.
*  That was only 30 years ago.
*  Okay, 30 years ago, from that to what you have today
*  is insane, insane.
*  The only thing, Joe, this is the only thing
*  that's gonna save humanity, battery life.
*  Yeah, but China has developed
*  these nuclear powered batteries.
*  We were just talking about that.
*  They could power a cell phone for 50 years.
*  Yeah, I don't know if this is just theoretical
*  or if they've actually implemented it.
*  That's the thing, I think I was like,
*  the motherfucking battery has to die.
*  Not necessarily.
*  It's just a matter of what they use for the fuel.
*  What we're dealing with now is no different
*  than what every civilization has always been dealing with.
*  If you could go back to the 1700s
*  before they had vaccines, before they had antibiotics
*  and medication and just show those people
*  back then a cell phone, they would think you're a wizard.
*  Or a witch.
*  A witch.
*  A witch, yeah.
*  A warlock, a satanist.
*  And if you called somebody to answer,
*  they would really thought that you were the devil.
*  Insane, if you were talking to someone FaceTime
*  from another place, that's normal shit now.
*  Whatever the fuck that robot is,
*  you take that robot that cleans kitchens
*  and scale that bitch up 200 years from now,
*  you got a sexy lady who's in lingerie
*  who's cleaning your house and sucks your dick
*  and you're never gonna mess with real ladies again.
*  And then the human race goes extinct
*  because no one wants to breed anymore.
*  The human race is gonna go extinct
*  when there's a female robot
*  that can make a sandwich and suck a dick.
*  This is what I think.
*  That's what you think?
*  Yeah.
*  I like the way you think.
*  That's what I think.
*  But it's gonna be another fucking robot
*  hating on the bitch.
*  Nope.
*  She's sucking his dick but she not making
*  money with him. They're gonna be perfect.
*  The robots only wanna please us so we die off.
*  The robots wanna leave all the ladies barren
*  and all the men, just no jizz,
*  they just suck them off all day.
*  And then leave them ambitionless, childless,
*  and then they die off.
*  The funny thing is, what you said is,
*  all I'm thinking about is,
*  I did a roast with Whitney Cummings
*  and they had a robot of her.
*  And I was thinking, just now,
*  who fucked Whitney's robot?
*  Somebody did.
*  Somebody did.
*  Somebody did.
*  I tried to, I did.
*  Somebody fucked that robot.
*  Shut up to her robot.
*  Whitney's the type of bitch that'll tell someone,
*  stick your dick in that robot before me,
*  I wanna watch, do it.
*  She got down like that.
*  But that sounds like-
*  I don't know.
*  I'm guessing.
*  Yeah.
*  She would be, and be experimental too.
*  She'd be like this, okay, let's shoot this.
*  Fuck my robot's mouth.
*  We can go, yeah.
*  She's a mom.
*  I talked to her like three weeks ago.
*  She's so cool seeing her.
*  It's wild, right?
*  Being her, being a mom.
*  She's so smart.
*  She's gonna be a great mom.
*  She's such an interesting person.
*  And I asked her, I said,
*  with the success that you've had in everything,
*  you're doing well for yourself,
*  you do well for other people,
*  you help other people.
*  I said, do you think,
*  cause that's a tough question
*  for successful women in this business.
*  I said, do you feel like having a baby boy completed you?
*  And she said, yes.
*  And that's the tough thing,
*  cause sometimes women are so career driven
*  that that part of them,
*  or that part of experience in life,
*  they don't really care about it
*  or just say it's embarrassing.
*  But she said that she does feel complete
*  and it makes her like a better person.
*  That's good.
*  And she just got,
*  she's got a nice mommy, mom energy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think.
*  And then she ran out of animals to buy.
*  That's when white women are about to-
*  Doesn't she have a horse?
*  Use a horse.
*  White women buy horses?
*  She has rescue horses.
*  Yeah, rescue horses.
*  When they start buying different animals,
*  like animals that the average person don't have,
*  like orangutans and shit like that,
*  that's when they'd be like,
*  yep, I'm about to have a baby.
*  She connected me with the people
*  that run this wolf sanctuary.
*  And I went up to the wolf sanctuary
*  and I thought I was gonna like it,
*  but I didn't like it at all.
*  I didn't like it at all.
*  I didn't like it at all, man.
*  What do you think she thought
*  you were gonna enjoy about it?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, like they're helping these wolves
*  and they're preserving these wolves
*  and they take wolves off of ranches
*  and capture them and keep them in this place.
*  But man, it just bummed me out big time.
*  The males have all been castrated.
*  They've all been fixed.
*  Yeah, that bummed me out.
*  And then they're all in these cages
*  and they're getting stared at by people.
*  So they're not preserving the race.
*  I mean, they're not preserving the wolf.
*  They let them out.
*  They interact with them.
*  You can interact with some,
*  but it overwhelmingly bummed me out.
*  I don't like the idea of wild predators
*  being trapped in cages.
*  I went to the zoo.
*  I took my son to the zoo
*  and it was like one of the best,
*  worst experiences I had.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just the excitement.
*  It's just like how much we so selfish.
*  The excitement of like,
*  one of the tigers came out of the cage
*  and everybody was like,
*  oh my God, yay!
*  They started clapping for the tiger.
*  And I'm like, this motherfucker's used to walking
*  like 50, 60 miles a day to try to kill some shit.
*  And this motherfucker's in 300 square feet
*  and we're clapping for it.
*  And it just felt.
*  The excitement that the kids had was one thing,
*  but knowing what has to go down.
*  And then for the people,
*  here's the people that got the toughest job.
*  The tour people that speak on the animals and everything.
*  They'd be like,
*  and this is, it must look a little frustrated today.
*  You know, the ones that gotta make it feel like
*  they're having a happy experience.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause everybody been throwing shit at this motherfucker.
*  Of course you would be frustrated too,
*  but it feels so wrong and so right at the same time.
*  Yeah.
*  Safari.
*  I wanna go on a safari.
*  That's real.
*  That's the real thing.
*  Safari is a different thing.
*  The thing that bums me out is the primates.
*  I went to the gym or the zoo rather in Denver.
*  And I remember we had gotten there right when this,
*  like we turned around this monkey cage,
*  right when this monkey was just wailing.
*  He just decided like he couldn't take it anymore.
*  And he's in this cage and he's wailing.
*  I'm not gonna wait a year
*  that they decided they couldn't take it anymore.
*  Wailing like he's wanting to get the fuck about it.
*  But I was on that.
*  I was on the edible.
*  Okay.
*  And I just was feeling this monkey's pain, the screaming.
*  He was just screaming, no!
*  Cause it's this little ass cage as small as this room.
*  And he's just running around grabbing branches.
*  He's bored as fuck, man.
*  And now you add motherfuckers taking pictures of you
*  all fucking day.
*  I had my son, this is so fucked up
*  and I know I shouldn't did it, but I rented a monkey.
*  We had a petting whole thing.
*  I rented a monkey and the monkey definitely
*  had some shit going on, right?
*  Because they gave the monkey, I feel so bad.
*  Everybody was at the monkey, looking at the monkey
*  and all of a sudden I heard everybody say,
*  eww, yuck, the monkey was eating a lollipop, jerking off.
*  Yo, yo Joe, I swear, in my church,
*  I swear my son's life.
*  Everybody was like, where the fuck you get this monkey from?
*  Right?
*  But now it's like, you know the phrase,
*  had his trainer monkey see monkey do something.
*  I'm just thinking, did the trainer just sit around
*  this monkey, eat a lollipop, jerk it off.
*  Because, and the monkey was looking like,
*  he was looking like I wish the fuck somebody would say shit,
*  but the cover back on, leave me the fuck alone.
*  And the monkey was looking people directly in the eyes, Joe.
*  It wasn't like the monkey discovered it.
*  It was like this monkey's like,
*  this is how we get the fuck off work early.
*  Did you ever see that video of the dude
*  who's like sitting there and a monkey hops in his lap
*  and then he's like trying to be cool with this monkey
*  and the monkey just decides to scalp him.
*  Just bites his head and takes a giant chunk
*  of his scalp off.
*  Have you ever seen one?
*  No, I don't really go for those types.
*  You wanna see it?
*  I really don't.
*  You don't wanna see it?
*  I'm not built for that, I don't like skinning.
*  That's amazing.
*  You have amazing willpower.
*  I don't wanna do it.
*  I definitely wanna see it.
*  I'd be like, what?
*  Show me that.
*  I don't want, that's the difference.
*  You're very into that.
*  That's like that nature medal,
*  one of those websites where.
*  Nature's medal, yeah.
*  It's like, yeah, I can't handle that shit.
*  But man, taking one of those creatures
*  and forcing it to live in captivity is torture.
*  And it has to be a point
*  where they know it's gonna be the breaking point.
*  Yeah, that monkey, when I turned the corner,
*  right when I was going towards the cages,
*  I just watched him just jump on the cage
*  and it's just like, ah!
*  And you just kept on, you take pictures?
*  No man, I got bummed out.
*  I got really bummed out.
*  That's gotta be.
*  That might've been the last,
*  no, I definitely went to the zoo after that.
*  And I know, when they go, I wonder,
*  but most of those monkeys,
*  they get them from when they were babies, right?
*  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
*  It's still torture.
*  It's still torture.
*  You think that monkey could,
*  you think that monkey could like,
*  if you was like, fuck it, we're leaving,
*  and you just took him to the jungle that he could.
*  No, he's fucked.
*  He'd get fucked up, right?
*  He'd get fucked up.
*  Yeah, he wouldn't be a part of a troop.
*  Why, because he wouldn't know how to fight
*  or know this shit, right?
*  He probably wouldn't be socialized.
*  He wouldn't know the dynamics of social dynamic.
*  Waiting for feed time and shit,
*  knowing that every man for himself,
*  every monkey for himself.
*  He would have no idea.
*  He would be fucked.
*  They'd probably kill him.
*  It's, when I was in Costa Rica,
*  I saw a monkey, there's monkeys everywhere,
*  and one monkey was missing a foot.
*  Like one of his hands was gone.
*  And I said to the dude, I go,
*  what happened to him, do you think?
*  He's like, oh, they bite each other's hands off
*  all the time.
*  As a matter of fact.
*  I was like, what?
*  They bite each other's hands off.
*  That's, they're primitive.
*  They're monkeys, Joe, what the fuck do you want them to do?
*  But they're also resort monkeys,
*  so they come around and try to get Oreos from you.
*  Those are thieves.
*  Candy bars.
*  But they want that from you, and people give it to them.
*  And so you could watch them.
*  They'll take an Oreo and open it up and eat the white stuff.
*  They're used to it.
*  And you're like, what do you, you know how to do that?
*  Like, they know how to do that.
*  And that's the only thing they're accustomed to.
*  And then if they go to regular woods,
*  and they'd be like, get your bitch ass Oreo cooking,
*  eating ass motherfucker out of here.
*  They could tell, you could tell a difference
*  between a monkey that grew up on crab and his food,
*  then a motherfucker that's stealing Oreos.
*  It's in their eyes, I'm sure of it.
*  Well, monkeys can get to populations that are very big,
*  and then they get super aggressive.
*  And then you got real problems.
*  You got real problems.
*  That happens in India.
*  Like there was one monkey,
*  that dog, I guess, had killed one monkey.
*  And so because of that,
*  they just decided to start killing dogs.
*  I remember that.
*  And that was fun.
*  That felt like a movie.
*  There was like, I remember that.
*  It was like monkeys from everywhere.
*  Just like we, any dog go in your house,
*  cause it's gonna be a problem.
*  Bro, they were throwing dogs off roofs.
*  They were dragging them.
*  The monkeys were.
*  And it looked like they knew like, yo,
*  we don't get these motherfuckers.
*  Oh, no, they did know.
*  They did know.
*  Two killer monkeys captured in India
*  after revenge massacre of 250 dogs.
*  Bro.
*  Where my dogs at?
*  That is so crazy.
*  250.
*  They're fucking smart and they're fucking dangerous.
*  And the thing is like, they'll steal your baby, man.
*  They'll steal kids.
*  They're fucking creeps.
*  They're not stealing my baby.
*  Not yours.
*  But if you're not paying attention, they're creeps.
*  Do they give you, they have to give you a warning
*  like these are baby snatching.
*  I mean, it's like, here's the baby snatching monkeys.
*  Here's the Oreo eating monkeys.
*  And here are just the monkey monkeys.
*  All the mental issues.
*  Did you ever see the footage of Thailand
*  when they were like rampaging through the streets
*  cause all the tourists were gone because it was COVID?
*  No.
*  It's insane.
*  The monkeys just took up.
*  They were so used to the tourists.
*  So they're so used to the tourists feeding them.
*  Look at all these monkeys.
*  Oh, that's the one I was talking about.
*  Yeah, God damn.
*  How crazy is that?
*  I mean, there's so many of them, man.
*  They're everywhere.
*  So if you're around them, man, you're in danger.
*  Like if you have food, you're fucked.
*  They will 100% take your food.
*  And if you try to fight them,
*  they'll pull your fucking face off.
*  They look like the riots.
*  Bro, there's so many of them.
*  That looks great.
*  What does the number of monkeys were in that?
*  Does it say?
*  The video says thousands.
*  I don't know.
*  God.
*  You gotta start shooting monkeys.
*  Somebody needs to go out there with a shotgun
*  and start taking care of business.
*  I'm not going anywhere where wildlife,
*  other than the woods.
*  I deal with snakes and shit like that.
*  Bro, ancient Thai cities overrun with monkeys.
*  They look as long as they stay cool.
*  But I guess you just have to feed them to keep them cool.
*  There's not gonna be enough food.
*  I guess if they like...
*  He put a tiger head in the shop to scare them away.
*  No, did he really?
*  I got a tiger's head as well.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Like he doesn't know that monkey knows
*  that that thing doesn't move.
*  It's gonna be one monkey to go touch them.
*  Like, no, motherfucker, get the fuck out of here.
*  Yeah, this bullshit, man.
*  Look, they're just hanging.
*  Look at the balls on that monkey too.
*  Increasingly aggressive.
*  Street brawls.
*  Whoa, rival macaque gangs.
*  World star.
*  Bro, they have rival gangs of monkeys.
*  That's crazy.
*  It affects their health when they eat human food.
*  Yeah, they fucking feel better.
*  The more energy they have, yeah.
*  If they eat human food, it's probably better.
*  I watch that and I say, God bless America.
*  If you could give monkeys cheeseburgers, they'd be pumped.
*  If you likes to have an in and out.
*  But didn't you have a monkey like this?
*  I was gonna say double, double.
*  Like, no, fuck, it'll be monkeys come up here.
*  Oh, man, that's how people from different cities come.
*  They're like, this is my first in and out burger.
*  That's what I would be.
*  Here's the thing about those monkeys in Thailand.
*  Was that always like that?
*  Like when did they get overrun by monkeys?
*  Like, did they have those amount of monkeys 20 years ago?
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  I think it would probably be during the pandemic
*  when it got real crazy.
*  Well, I think that got real crazy,
*  crazy where they wanted the gangs
*  and they started like,
*  cause there's no more food.
*  Cause the tourists weren't there.
*  They was like separating which one?
*  East side, west side monkey.
*  But my thought was like,
*  were there that many of them in cities 20 years ago?
*  Or is that a recent thing?
*  You know, is that a thing where they're figuring it out
*  and then their population is gonna get bigger and bigger?
*  Joe, they're getting prepared for AI.
*  They know it's coming.
*  I don't think they are.
*  They're getting prepared for AI.
*  They know that once they create the first
*  monkey created through artificial intelligence,
*  that all of them, they're gonna be out of business.
*  They're preparing for it the same way,
*  but they just not talking about it, Joe.
*  And that's the only thing that separates them from us
*  is ability to communicate.
*  There's speculation more recently
*  that they're actually missing now.
*  This monkey's thinking the same shit that you're thinking.
*  They're missing?
*  Monkeys are going missing.
*  They're seeing less numbers in the streets.
*  And they're speculating.
*  They're leaving Hollywood.
*  They're leaving Hollywood.
*  Traffickers have snuggled them out of the country.
*  They're leaving, Joe.
*  I think I accidentally snuggled them.
*  I meant smuggled them.
*  Yeah, that makes sense.
*  They're leaving Hollywood.
*  They're going somewhere else where it feels safer
*  and it's easier.
*  Same thing with me, Joe.
*  A lot of them, they go to private zoos, we found out,
*  in the Middle East.
*  Everybody can afford a private zoo.
*  A lot of ballers can, though.
*  And that's like a thing, to have a private zoo
*  and to have your own.
*  If you're some dude and you're living in some...
*  So you've rescued these monkeys
*  and then you're putting them in a private zoo
*  to do what?
*  What is your life goal after that?
*  Well, people stare at those monkeys at their private zoo.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think there's insanely wealthy people
*  that have private zoos.
*  I think it's a normal thing.
*  Thousands of monkeys invade Thai city,
*  driving out tourists and businesses.
*  This is recently.
*  Yeah, so it's like this is back to what it was
*  during the pandemic.
*  It looks like they're invading that city.
*  They're coming back.
*  And it says some investors might take their money out
*  until they address the issue.
*  Yeah.
*  There's about to be some poison.
*  What about the poison that shit out the monkeys?
*  Well...
*  3,500 monkeys.
*  They're gonna do some lace Oreos.
*  They're about to kill all of them.
*  They're gonna have to do something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They're about to kill.
*  They're gonna give them COVID.
*  The monkeys is dead.
*  They're probably gonna give them some poison.
*  I think at a certain point,
*  you kind of have to control the population,
*  as sick as that sounds.
*  They're gonna wipe...
*  That's crazy.
*  Just let them climb on people.
*  They're gonna take about a thousand of them, right?
*  Put them away.
*  Put them away.
*  Or just have them somewhere
*  when they wanna give them the breed.
*  This sounds crazy.
*  I think they're just gonna poison a fuckload of them.
*  I think you're right.
*  They can't poison all...
*  Why not?
*  I'm right the second time, Joe.
*  Can't kill them all, Joe.
*  You don't have to kill them all.
*  Then what are you gonna do about it?
*  There's so many of them.
*  You just give it a certain amount of food.
*  And the most aggressive ones
*  are the ones that are gonna get the food first.
*  And so that way you get rid of the most douchey
*  of all the douchey monkeys.
*  Oh, then you say, okay, that makes sense.
*  My custom would get about 4,000 of them,
*  round them up, and then they give them some poison
*  and the other one is just, it's out.
*  Yeah.
*  They start back up.
*  Listen, either one can work,
*  but I think that rounding them up,
*  you could probably sell them.
*  They're probably worth a lot of money.
*  I think there's a lot more of those private zoos
*  than we like to think there are.
*  Yeah, but I don't know anybody that has a private zoo.
*  I don't even know anybody that would know
*  about a private zoo.
*  You don't know any oil dudes either.
*  There's probably some oil dudes out there
*  that go to private zoo.
*  That's the oil dude.
*  You got 1,000 Ferraris in a private zoo.
*  Saudi Arabia.
*  Yeah, you got a tiger.
*  Dubai.
*  You got a fucking bunch of monkeys.
*  And you got your own zoo.
*  We got these right from Thailand.
*  It's not enough of those old dudes
*  to keep the species alive.
*  So back to my situation.
*  Lock up 3,000.
*  Keep the species alive?
*  Lock up 3,000 of the monkeys
*  and then poison the rest of them
*  and then you can control.
*  It's the new Bob Barker.
*  Help control the pet population.
*  Have your monkeys spayed and neutered.
*  Well.
*  We can change the world.
*  I think you just gotta control the populations.
*  And unfortunately, the only way to control the populations
*  is either give them birth control,
*  which is a problem, right?
*  In the hood. That's weird.
*  Anyway. In the streets.
*  How's that gonna work?
*  Or you have to kill them.
*  So, or you sell them to rich dudes who have their own.
*  They've been there since the 13th century.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That's a bad idea.
*  Children are just getting rid of them.
*  How many did they have back then?
*  Was it those kind of numbers?
*  The numbers have gone up and down.
*  I just read through a tourist thing
*  about people going to the city.
*  Remember the last train leaves at 1806.
*  You don't wanna get stuck there.
*  Oh my God.
*  Stuck by the monkeys?
*  Bro, imagine if you get stuck by the monkeys
*  and you got a candy bar
*  and they just fuck you up.
*  Yeah, so I'll both of them.
*  You try to eat a candy bar in front of those monkeys,
*  they will fuck you up.
*  I think I'll both of them out there
*  has just been shitted on.
*  Yeah, both of them.
*  1300. 1300.
*  It's not gonna be enough.
*  But then again, how old is that city?
*  I think whenever they find groups of people,
*  they probably realize they're cute
*  and people give them food if they have any extra.
*  Only tourists didn't have to tourists
*  not gonna come there to go back to their normal wildness.
*  Tourists are the only thing that's probably kept them cool.
*  I wonder if wolves will ever get to the point again
*  where they become dogs again.
*  The reason why wolves became dogs
*  is because people were having campfires
*  and the wolves would come around,
*  they'd feed them and those are the ones that stayed close.
*  Their ears got floppy and then they started breeding them
*  and then they became dogs over thousands of years.
*  I wonder if we'll fuck things up so hardcore
*  and wolves will be everywhere again,
*  the real wolves will be everywhere again
*  and we'll start doing dogs again from scratch.
*  Which species would be first?
*  I know a chihuahua, my punk dog couldn't help.
*  Yeah, definitely closest one.
*  Huskies, huskies, German Shepherds.
*  Not a Frenchie.
*  They probably looked like that.
*  They probably looked like just many, many, many, many,
*  because you gotta think a dog or even a wolf,
*  how long do they live?
*  How long does a wolf live in the wild?
*  Is it like a dog or like an old one
*  that's like 15, 16 years old?
*  How long is a wolf?
*  Life expectancy of a wolf.
*  Captivity is up to 20 in the sense that the wild
*  is no longer than 10 years usually.
*  Wow, up to 20 in captivity.
*  So it's basically like a dog, up to 20,
*  like dogs that live 20 years.
*  So let's imagine how many generations you can get
*  just in the course of one person's life.
*  You know, you breed, when the wolf pup is a year and a half
*  or two years old, you breed them.
*  They breed again, they breed again.
*  You keep selecting for the ones that are the most docile,
*  the most obedient, floppy ears, shorter snout,
*  and you just keep doing that over and over again.
*  Within a couple of hundred years,
*  you have a totally different animal.
*  You have a totally different animal
*  because you're dealing with so many generations.
*  So what you're saying, in over hundreds of years,
*  so we're gonna have robotic motherfuckers
*  raising these wolf dogs.
*  That's your prediction.
*  No, one of many things can happen.
*  One thing can happen is natural disaster.
*  Natural disaster, like a big one,
*  like Yellowstone blowing up.
*  Like Yellowstone is a super volcano,
*  and if it blows up, it's like a continent killer.
*  It's gonna fuck up the whole continent.
*  Does it have the possibility of?
*  100%, 100%, it goes every six to 800,000 years.
*  And I think the last time it went was 600,000 years ago.
*  Oh shit, I was preparing for this total eclipse.
*  Now I'm the fucking here.
*  Nah, a total eclipse is nothing.
*  That's April.
*  April 8th, that's gonna be fun.
*  That'll be interesting to watch.
*  Are you gonna watch it?
*  I'm gonna be in Ohio when it happens.
*  It's going right here.
*  It's traveling right above here.
*  But they say Ohio is the best place to see it.
*  Is that true?
*  Dave probably told you that.
*  No, no, I think Burt Kreischer told me that
*  because he's gonna be in the big one.
*  Well, Burt Kreischer is not necessarily Wikipedia.
*  I don't.
*  Why you hating, man?
*  Goddamn, what's wrong with you today?
*  Fuck Whitney and her baby.
*  Fuck David Tell.
*  Fucking Burt Kreischer, no shit about anything galactic.
*  What the fuck is going?
*  It's a new day, Joe.
*  So this is the path.
*  Yellow Springs is a great spot.
*  Right in the center.
*  Just as good as here.
*  So you question.
*  Just as good as here, though.
*  Yeah, it's taking the path.
*  We're in Austin.
*  It goes right through us.
*  Yeah, but Jamie, I like the idea of me being right.
*  I was right.
*  Yeah, we definitely right.
*  But I mean, it literally passes right through us.
*  There you go, David.
*  So where are we, Jamie?
*  Go to where we are.
*  And this happens every what, seven years?
*  I feel like I've been to one before.
*  We'll see.
*  We'll get a very, very, very, very good view of it,
*  but you need to be about 50 miles to the west.
*  What time, Jamie?
*  To get like, I don't know.
*  I think it's like one o'clock, it says, yeah.
*  AM, of course.
*  No, PM, PM, PM, PM.
*  You wouldn't, that wouldn't be a Sunday.
*  Well, there's gotta be some places you can go
*  where you don't have to make a big deal out of it.
*  You know?
*  I think you can look through the,
*  if you have a Tesla with the right roof,
*  you can look through that safely
*  because it's got all the protection on it.
*  Oh, that's outrageous.
*  That's what I read.
*  Well, Roka's making glasses.
*  They're making glasses.
*  Just specific for this?
*  Yeah, just specific for this.
*  So you can't look at it for not any period of time?
*  It's not good to look at it at all.
*  I remember when I was a kid in Ohio, like, I don't know.
*  Now it would have been like 95 or something.
*  It was a weird day,
*  but it gets really strangely dark outside for a little bit.
*  You wanna look at it, obviously,
*  because you're attracted to it.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  It will fuck up your eyes just like staring at like a laser.
*  Okay.
*  It could get bad if you look at it for a long time.
*  I don't think I'm gonna look at it that long.
*  Not long enough for it to go bad.
*  I mean, it is interesting,
*  but in the greater scheme of the universe,
*  is it that interesting?
*  All it is is alignment of stars.
*  But it's something that makes it interesting
*  is that it doesn't happen, but what, every what, 10 years?
*  That's true.
*  Jamie, I'm gonna send you something
*  because this is interesting.
*  Do you remember when Trump looked at the eclipse?
*  Oh yeah, he looked right at it, right?
*  This blink, squinting his eyes is fucking hilarious.
*  Those are the guys, it's stormed.
*  Yeah, he's so ridiculous.
*  Hold on, gotta find this fucking thing.
*  Okay.
*  Joe, you asked me time and time again about my special.
*  You didn't even watch it.
*  Nope, I don't watch anything.
*  I'm too busy right now.
*  And plus, I don't even know if I got a link.
*  Someone send me a link?
*  You'd have to like send me a link for me to watch it.
*  It's streaming on Netflix, Joe.
*  Oh, when did it start?
*  February 27th, thank you for that.
*  I didn't know.
*  February, it's streaming, it's actually streaming.
*  It's on Netflix.
*  Oh, you need an advance link.
*  No, an advance of...
*  You need it before everybody gets to see it.
*  I didn't know it was out.
*  That's the only way you would watch it
*  if you had a private link with codes and everything, Joe?
*  That's how I like to watch things.
*  So just like...
*  I like to feel special.
*  So just like putting the name of it in Netflix is,
*  you don't do that, right Joe?
*  Well, I don't do that anymore.
*  So you're preparing for artificial intelligence
*  of a special release?
*  Yeah, that's a better way to do it.
*  All right.
*  Definitely.
*  That's not what I'm saying.
*  It came out February 27th, man.
*  And it did well.
*  People like it.
*  The streets like it.
*  The streets.
*  Yep, the creeks, the creeks.
*  The creeks and the streets like it.
*  I'm gonna send you this, Jamie,
*  because this is just a very strange thing
*  that happened at the club the other night
*  that almost doesn't make sense.
*  So we were in the green room.
*  I feel like I wanna send you the link for my special.
*  Casey Rocket was on stage in the small room
*  and Tony Hinchcliffe was on stage in the big room.
*  Fuck Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  Now the room, the shows had been going on for hours.
*  In the small room, it was the open mic.
*  So there might have been 20 people on before.
*  And in the big room, it started at a different time
*  and this was 45 minutes into the show.
*  So three comedians had gone up.
*  But somehow or another, the time synced perfectly.
*  Within the both rooms.
*  So as the timer was going off,
*  Bob Biggerstaff, he's the first person to notice it
*  and he pointed it out to us.
*  So like, go back.
*  Computer rebelled?
*  Really?
*  Anyway.
*  So you had an eclipse of your rooms?
*  Yeah, it's like an eclipse.
*  This is like an eclipse.
*  The odds of this happening are so small.
*  One show started at 10 p.m.
*  Or 8 p.m.
*  The other show started earlier than that
*  and had an open mic night.
*  So they'd have like 10 people had been up before.
*  And KC Rocket is on stage.
*  He's at five minutes and 24 seconds.
*  And Tony's on stage in the other room.
*  Five minutes, 24 seconds.
*  And we were like, this is crazy.
*  Like, what are the odds of this happening?
*  Who, not only did it happen,
*  like who would even notice that it happened?
*  Bob did.
*  If he didn't notice it, it might have been lost in time.
*  Yeah, Tony fucking did.
*  Just his fans are.
*  The guilt's all he has.
*  Yo, they're his motherfuckers, boy.
*  And this is what I got going back to,
*  like not reading the comments.
*  I think the last time I did Kill Tony,
*  it was probably like three or four years ago, right?
*  I'll be having a good comment day, Joe.
*  Oh, good day.
*  Yeah, hey, I love you, I love you.
*  Then the next thing, we'll ask him
*  if he's gonna walk out on Kill Tony's podcast again.
*  Yeah, well.
*  What do you do?
*  Gotta let that one go.
*  I wanna go back.
*  Well, then go back.
*  I'm afraid.
*  Then get your ass.
*  Well, the power of it.
*  Go back, but be ready.
*  Wait a minute, first of all, I was ready.
*  But you still walked off.
*  That's what you believe, Joe?
*  Did you not walk off?
*  You didn't know what the real story,
*  that's what you believe?
*  I don't know.
*  That's all propaganda.
*  I had completely forgotten about it.
*  I'll tell you what happened.
*  I was here first of all.
*  I did Tony's show during the pandemic.
*  Right.
*  When he couldn't get guests.
*  Right.
*  I risked my fucking life.
*  Risked your life.
*  For him.
*  Right.
*  And these punk ass motherfuckers.
*  Yes.
*  Good show.
*  Black comic goes up.
*  I've been here two and a half hours.
*  They just drink, give me tea,
*  tea doses and tea doses and tea doses.
*  They're forcing you to drink.
*  Whatever, I know that I consume tea doses and tea doses.
*  Right.
*  Then I had a date, a sushi date.
*  You know the sushi spot I'm talking about.
*  The one that, the private joint.
*  It looks like a speakeasy.
*  Six people.
*  I had a reservation for that.
*  So I'm doing this show.
*  I told them I'm going to the bathroom
*  because I was gonna go eat.
*  And they made it look like I ran off the show joke.
*  Really?
*  You went for that bullshit edit.
*  I had been on the show for two and a.
*  You should sue.
*  It's not a bad idea.
*  But I like Tony.
*  I don't like this for fucking pain and suffering.
*  Just take him to court.
*  And it's petty and I don't really give a fuck.
*  Then go back.
*  But it's, yo, I would love to.
*  As soon as my schedule allows it, I'll go back.
*  Why are you looking at me like I got a problem going back?
*  No, I don't.
*  Okay, wait a minute.
*  Bathroom, that is not a comedian.
*  Go rewind it.
*  Did I, now this is what they did, Joe.
*  They showed me talking to the comedian.
*  Then look, look, all right, watch this.
*  Is that me running off from a comedian?
*  That's like, I'll be right back.
*  Going to the bathroom.
*  Look, ghost, look, keep following it.
*  Walks off.
*  To the bathroom.
*  To the bathroom.
*  But what they showed,
*  Jamie, can you, I'm glad we get to fucking put this out there.
*  Can you show the edit they did?
*  Just put, Donnie L. walks off.
*  Donnie L. walks off in an edit.
*  Now watch what they do in a fucking edit.
*  Donnie L. walks off.
*  How many times have you watched this?
*  Only 4,000.
*  Why have you?
*  That 4,000.
*  Why have you really spent?
*  I haven't spent no time, I just remember it.
*  This is the first time I actually saw the original.
*  They factored it up.
*  They doctored it up.
*  The white man.
*  That seems out of place.
*  I'm making it race.
*  The white man doctored.
*  Feel like they should have done that.
*  They shouldn't have done it.
*  But your argument is about that.
*  You first thing, and it worked on you,
*  because you said, yeah, that time you walked out just.
*  Can I call Tony right now?
*  Yeah, and the way you looked at me,
*  the way you looked at me was like,
*  what you gonna do about it?
*  Call Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  Hold please.
*  Yeah, did you got that?
*  I know it's gotta come up.
*  I'm looking for it.
*  The one I found that doesn't seem,
*  you're not even in the video yet.
*  Yeah, this is, yeah, tell him I'm still sensitive about it.
*  And I took him to eat fried chicken.
*  Tony Hinchcliffe?
*  Yo, what's up, man?
*  Hey, dude, I'm here.
*  You're on the podcast right now.
*  I'm here with Don-El Rawlings.
*  And I'm still beefing, motherfucker.
*  Tell him the real story.
*  Tell him the real story.
*  Did you edit the show to make it look like Don-El was upset
*  and that a man clowned him and he walked up the stage?
*  A black man, did you edit it?
*  First off, Tony, Tony.
*  Tony, you fucking, fully shit, man.
*  Nothing was edited.
*  Tony, you fucking, fully shit, man.
*  Nothing was edited?
*  So Tony, what you see is actually
*  the true events that took place?
*  No, 100%.
*  And he never, you know, I mean,
*  it's absolutely not even in question.
*  You know, everybody was doing what they were doing.
*  Is Don-El trying to pull a PR move here?
*  Is this the reason why black people have issues?
*  I mean, whatever he's doing, it's very shady.
*  And he's trying to rewrite history.
*  Oh, all right, Jamie, for me, for the sake of God,
*  now he can't find it.
*  This is outrageous, Tony.
*  I don't know what to think.
*  Now he can't find it.
*  We have pictures of him outside of a firehouse
*  after the moment he was saying hi to people
*  at the fire department.
*  They were like fans of his.
*  And he went and hung out with them.
*  He had nothing to do, he had nowhere to go.
*  Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.
*  This is getting worse.
*  I can't believe this, man.
*  I can't believe you left out details
*  only to use them as a weapon
*  when confronted by propaganda.
*  Kudos to you, sir, for holding your cards.
*  Fucking kudos.
*  Tony supports black on black crime.
*  He pitted two black guys against each other.
*  Oh, wait a minute, I thought you said
*  that you went to the bathroom
*  and none of that stuff happened.
*  They edited it.
*  I went to the bathroom.
*  He said that he was going to the bathroom.
*  He walked all the way out the front door.
*  Right, to the sushi spot, son.
*  I left for sushi.
*  He said he left for sushi.
*  Jamie, please.
*  His reservations were much later
*  than when he lost his work.
*  All right, now watch this.
*  Is this it?
*  Donnell Roling walks off.
*  Now watch the edit.
*  Mom and dad G's on the same fucking stage.
*  Now watch.
*  If you don't get the fuck out of here,
*  where'd you get those Jordans?
*  I've invited Donnell back on.
*  Hold on, hold on a second.
*  We're watching the video of it right now.
*  I'm gonna say this.
*  Yeah, I like it.
*  I got something funny.
*  You look like Idris Elba Fuck the Blowfish.
*  This nigga shot for tank tops in Victoria's Secret.
*  Totino's kicking in right now.
*  You know why I wanna suck him, you little...
*  You wretch!
*  He's a Christian.
*  He's the most successful crack baby.
*  I was over there thinking of jokes for this moment.
*  I know what he wanted to do.
*  Oh yeah, if I fucking rose Donnell.
*  No, man.
*  Tito's.
*  I'm about to leave right now because...
*  No, you're not.
*  Come on, Donnell.
*  No, I'm gonna leave.
*  Look.
*  I wanna go.
*  Wrap it up.
*  Thank you, Tony.
*  He's throwing the candles?
*  This is really happening.
*  Tony, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  Look, look, that's not the...
*  I see the truth.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Whew, Donnell.
*  Tony's a liar.
*  That was shameful.
*  I had to go to the bathroom.
*  I get it.
*  I had to go to the bathroom.
*  What I was supposed to do?
*  Sit there, act like I'm in the woods?
*  Yeah, it's just you came to a gunfight with a robber sword.
*  I didn't come to a gunfight.
*  I wasn't there for that joke.
*  I know, you were there to host.
*  You didn't know you were gonna get attacked, ruthlessly.
*  Why you were drunk.
*  Too drunk to defend yourself.
*  Too drunk.
*  That was very abusive.
*  Very abusive.
*  To our friendship, and I called Tony a friend.
*  I don't think he realized it was gonna happen, though,
*  to be honest.
*  No one plans anything on Kiltop.
*  This is what I'm saying, black on black crime.
*  I was given this African American comedian,
*  some good advice on comedy,
*  and then he just started shooting me.
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
*  And I wasn't ready for that.
*  I was like, how could you do that to me?
*  And then all the white people started laughing.
*  Oh, look at the black on black crime.
*  We don't gotta do anything.
*  They're killing themselves.
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
*  RIP George Floyd.
*  That's a very interesting way to put it.
*  That's exactly what my people saw, Joe.
*  And it was all, and Tony and his crew of henchmen
*  set it up.
*  Interesting.
*  Henchmen.
*  The henchcliff.
*  Hinchcliff men. Yes.
*  And he lied.
*  Just right now.
*  People are gonna believe that.
*  He just lied.
*  Seems like he wasn't lying though
*  because we watched the video.
*  I don't know what you saw, Joe.
*  What did you see?
*  I saw something totally different.
*  I saw a guy that had to go to the bathroom.
*  Okay.
*  That's what happened.
*  Okay, we settled it.
*  We're in the world of editing.
*  I had to go to the bathroom,
*  I went to the bathroom,
*  and then I went to the bathroom,
*  and then I did sushi.
*  I really don't care.
*  It's a new day.
*  I'm gonna let it go.
*  Yeah, let's let it go.
*  Let's let it go.
*  Didn't go well.
*  Expected it to go.
*  But I appreciate the fact checking
*  and appreciate the research
*  of the doctored clip you had, Jamie.
*  Thank you.
*  It is kind of rude, Jamie,
*  that you did that to Donnell.
*  I thought that's the one he wanted me to find.
*  I mean, you could have put up any clip,
*  but you chose to go with the CGI AI doctor,
*  Tony Hinchcliff, henchman version.
*  Yep.
*  That's it.
*  But long as like-
*  How you done?
*  How many fucking times have you done Kill Tony?
*  Three times.
*  That's it?
*  Yep. Really?
*  Yeah, I did it in LA.
*  Maybe two.
*  I did it in LA.
*  I had a lot of fun.
*  I did it with Tony Lucas was on that one.
*  We had a good time.
*  I caught a stand ovation on that joint.
*  Nice.
*  I did that one, then I did the one here.
*  When David, Lucas, and Tony tear each other apart,
*  it's the hardest I ever laughed.
*  Oh yeah?
*  David goes after Tony so hard,
*  and Tony goes after David.
*  And they're both laughing really hard
*  at each other getting clowned.
*  But wait, wait, wait.
*  It's really fun.
*  And then when me and David went at it,
*  it was an example of joning,
*  because everybody was like,
*  oh, you didn't let him talk.
*  I'm like, when I came up with roasting,
*  whatever you call it, you don't let nobody talk.
*  You just go into that person,
*  you run out of breath or run out of jokes.
*  It wasn't like, and now it's your turn.
*  You get three seconds.
*  Right.
*  It's not slap fighting.
*  I'm not a big fan of it.
*  I don't like roast.
*  I might've been invited to,
*  or agreed to do three roasts in my entire career.
*  I think they're too personal.
*  I mean, it's funny to some people,
*  but I think it's just too personal.
*  It's too easy just to be disrespectful.
*  Oh, just a joke.
*  You meant that shit and it hurts.
*  Yeah, it's a license to be mean.
*  Yeah, and I don't like it.
*  I did Whitney's.
*  I did Whitney's.
*  Whitney called me and I said,
*  I don't like the roast, right?
*  I don't do that thing.
*  And then she told me how much I was gonna pay.
*  I said, so I need to be there at five, right?
*  That's so stupid.
*  We coming off the pandemic.
*  Wasn't nobody making money.
*  I did it with her.
*  Wasn't it wildly did it on OnlyFans?
*  OnlyFans has had comedy specials.
*  I know, but it was dope.
*  I really think, I really saw her as a producer doing that
*  and being able to put people together.
*  And she was really, really serious about making it look good,
*  get the right people involved.
*  It was fun every time.
*  She's great at all kinds of stuff.
*  She's always juggling things.
*  I remember I was talking to her.
*  She was in the middle of writing a script, right?
*  And she's like, I'm gonna put the script aside for a bit
*  because I'm doing this documentary on violence.
*  I'm like, what?
*  Oh yeah. What?
*  And oh yeah, did I tell you I'm having a baby next week?
*  Oh, I'm having a baby.
*  Nine months pregnant apparently.
*  Yeah, out of nowhere.
*  Picture that. Who would have known?
*  She's a maniac.
*  Yeah, but it was fun.
*  It was fun working with her.
*  I did it with her.
*  I did it with Bert Kreischer, Jim Norton.
*  It was so funny.
*  And we had to roast without having to be too mean.
*  That's cool.
*  It was cool. I had a good time.
*  But I mean, if you ever,
*  I'll send you the link for my special you can check out.
*  No, I'll watch it.
*  I'll just watch it on Netflix.
*  I will. You're not gonna watch it.
*  There's a few that I need to watch.
*  I still haven't watched Shane's.
*  I didn't watch Dave's last one.
*  I don't watch too much to end up other than a lot.
*  I try to like balance the amount of entertainment
*  I get in general.
*  I know I didn't really expect you to watch it.
*  I will watch it.
*  Jesus Christ, I'm gonna watch it.
*  You don't have to watch it, Joe.
*  I feel like I have to watch it now.
*  You don't have to watch it.
*  Jamie, doesn't it feel like I have to watch it?
*  I'm watching it right now.
*  You talk.
*  Jamie's watching it right now.
*  I like the intro.
*  I respect Jamie.
*  The thing I like the most, the intro.
*  Yeah?
*  It's good. You gotta watch it.
*  I watch it.
*  But you don't have to, but watch it.
*  Because you were like,
*  when is the special coming out?
*  Probably watch it.
*  All right.
*  It was fun.
*  Okay.
*  But the thing is, one thing about a special,
*  and you've done a lot of them,
*  the special thing about it is like, all right,
*  what's next?
*  It forces you to have to start over.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's a lot of people,
*  people don't understand the pressure,
*  I feel, of a special,
*  because people always say,
*  well, this is what people say.
*  It happened to me last week.
*  I did a show, somebody said,
*  I liked the show I just saw more than I liked the special.
*  I don't know if people understand,
*  the funniest, you're probably gonna see a comedian,
*  is right before he shoots a special,
*  and right after the special.
*  Also, just live is always funnier.
*  Live is always funnier.
*  It's way funnier.
*  I always say that if you see a really good special,
*  a really good special is like 60 to maybe 70%
*  as funny as it is if you were in the place.
*  Exactly.
*  Probably like 60.
*  And that's the hardest,
*  the hardest thing to capture,
*  is that feeling like-
*  You can't capture it.
*  With this special for me,
*  first time I was telling you earlier,
*  first time I did it,
*  he can't do it because of the COVID stuff.
*  The second time we were in Napa Valley,
*  we were doing some shows there,
*  and you know, Chappelle records all of his shows.
*  Probably you do the same thing.
*  So he asked the producer, Ricky Hughes,
*  she said, how many cameras do we have here today?
*  She said, we got five.
*  He looks at me and says,
*  do you wanna shoot your special?
*  I'm like, when?
*  Tomorrow.
*  I'm like, who the fuck says-
*  Right.
*  But I got excited because I was like,
*  I liked the idea of it not being a spectacle.
*  Right.
*  I liked the idea of nobody knowing about it.
*  Right.
*  It was only three people that knew
*  we were even gonna go for it.
*  Right.
*  Everything else was like a regular show.
*  I was like, oh, you know what?
*  This would be so dope.
*  No pressure.
*  Yeah.
*  Shot it, killed it, Joe.
*  I was doing a regular thing.
*  I wasn't thinking about special, just regular show.
*  Killed it.
*  I'm like, oh shit, I called Robbie Propp,
*  and I'm like, yo, we got the special.
*  He like, let me see it.
*  You been saying that, right?
*  Three weeks later, Dave calls me again.
*  I wanna shoot the special over.
*  I'm like, why?
*  He said, I didn't like the production.
*  I'm like, motherfucker, you're the producer.
*  He was like, yeah, but it was really small thing.
*  He was like, delighting.
*  And then it was people walking past, you know,
*  doing the show.
*  And I was like, well, you remember Live at Sunset Strip,
*  Richard Pryor, one of the funniest lines you remember
*  where he was like, look, white people left.
*  And then he came back, the seat's gone.
*  It was in the moment.
*  It was live, it felt live.
*  That's where I thought, if that felt live.
*  He was like, down there, we'll put it out.
*  But I'm telling you, if we're gonna do it,
*  we scratched the second one.
*  Cut to the third one.
*  And I think out of all the criticism
*  and everything he said leading up to his reasons
*  why he wanted to do it again, I think that I caught it.
*  And people's like, do you think that was your best?
*  In that moment, that night,
*  it was the best I could be that night.
*  Beautiful.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like, you know, we'll do shit.
*  You say, I'm not doing that joke before.
*  You know you've performed these jokes better,
*  but can you capture it in that moment and that night?
*  And I think I caught a good vibe.
*  Beautiful.
*  Darnell, I love you.
*  I'm not gonna watch it.
*  That's a lot, Darnell, you were great with it.
*  I love you, I have to take a leak.
*  And we gotta end this, we gotta wrap this up.
*  No problem.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Tell everybody the name of it.
*  It's The New Day on Netflix.
*  There it is.
*  It's The New Day.
*  That's another sharp suit.
*  I got two suits for two different situations.
*  The yellow in the pocket, I like it.
*  What's the button say?
*  DR, it's my logo.
*  Oh, nice.
*  Yep.
*  Proud of that, finally got it done.
*  Beautiful. Thank you.
*  Thank you, brother.
*  All right, bye everybody.
