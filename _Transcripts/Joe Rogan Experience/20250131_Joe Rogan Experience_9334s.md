# Joe Rogan Experience #2266 - Brian Simpson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5.8s)]
*  Little things you say. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=10.44s)]
*  I imagine having to be that measured in everything you say all the time. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=13.88s)]
*  Just stick to the talking points. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=20.16s)]
*  Bro, that's my whole life. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=21.16s)]
*  That's stressful. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=22.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's super stressful, especially if you're a little intoxicated. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=23.16s)]
*  You get a couple of whiskeys in you, you start talking shit. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=28.72s)]
*  You've got to be responsible for every word that comes out of your mouth, even if it's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  stupid. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=34.96s)]
*  But, you know, I think people get it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=35.96s)]
*  They get that people are human beings and they can stumble. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=38.0s)]
*  Like people, they forgave a lot of Biden stumbles until they were like, what the fuck? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, a lot of people like in 2020 were like, there's no way, there's no way he's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=46.32s)]
*  going to do it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=50.16s)]
*  He was too old to run when it was 2016. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=51.16s)]
*  He's kind of always been known for the gaffes. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=54.68s)]
*  Like, because I remember when Obama was picked him, that was the number one concern was like, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=57.4s)]
*  oh, but sometimes he be saying shit. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=62.36s)]
*  Didn't Obama, he was famous to quote as Joe as a, don't worry, Joe will find a way to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=64.28s)]
*  fuck things up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=68.52s)]
*  Oh, I never heard that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=69.52s)]
*  There's supposedly, well, it's hard to know what the quote was, but supposedly. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=71.56s)]
*  But he got out of all of it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=76.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=78.64s)]
*  Well, that's because the machine was behind him, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=79.64s)]
*  So he gets into office and you saw that like Mike Johnson guy, the Speaker of the House. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=82.16s)]
*  He said that he had talked to him. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  It took a year to have a meeting and he finally had this meeting with him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=88.4s)]
*  He was wanting to talk to him about something. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=91.4s)]
*  And he said, why did you sign this executive order? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  And it had something to do with liquid natural gas. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=96.16s)]
*  He said, I didn't sign that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  He said, yes, you did, sir. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=99.36s)]
*  You signed it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=100.36s)]
*  Can we get it? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=101.36s)]
*  And so he has the secretary printed up, he brings it in. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=102.36s)]
*  He had never read it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  So he was just signing executive orders that he didn't even know. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=105.12s)]
*  He didn't know what it was about. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=108.68s)]
*  He thought it was about research and it was about shutting it down. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=109.68s)]
*  And so there's a bunch of people behind him that want to do things and they think it's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=113.4s)]
*  for the best interest of the country and they're all acting as a big group that's like the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=119.48s)]
*  puppeteer of the president. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  And that's not how it's supposed to be. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=125.12s)]
*  It's not supposed to be that way. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=128.12s)]
*  But isn't that like that with every president? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=129.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=130.44s)]
*  Because I think when a president brings in a new cabinet and the new cabinet starts doing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=131.44s)]
*  different things, then you see what's happening right now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=135.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=137.56s)]
*  We've already found thousands of criminals that had snuck in here and had committed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=138.56s)]
*  multiple crimes while they were here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=144.04s)]
*  And the Biden administration had left them here and they allowed them to stay in these [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=146.08s)]
*  sanctuary cities and sanctuary states. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=149.52s)]
*  And Trump's just yanking them out and flying them back to Colombia and flying them back [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=152.3s)]
*  to Mexico and flying them back to wherever they're from. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=156.8s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=159.4s)]
*  No, but exporting them in planes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=160.4s)]
*  The Biden administration could have done this too. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=162.6s)]
*  But I think every president that get in there, they do little shit different than the other [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=165.12s)]
*  side. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=171.56s)]
*  But at the end of the day, the big major shit that would help out the average people, it [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=172.56s)]
*  always falls short of a couple of votes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=177.16s)]
*  Trump is talking about getting rid of income tax and replacing it with tariffs. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=179.96s)]
*  I asked him about that on the podcast. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=186.08s)]
*  I thought he was joking around. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=189.04s)]
*  He was saying that it would be better for the economy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=190.52s)]
*  We'd have way more money if instead of you paying tax, these companies should be paying [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=192.96s)]
*  tax. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=198.8s)]
*  Why are they making such a killing off the American people? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=199.8s)]
*  But the companies would just charge us bigger prices, wouldn't they? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=201.96s)]
*  Well here's the thing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=205.36s)]
*  Could they if we had American manufacturing that can make the same products? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=211.84s)]
*  So the whole reason why... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=212.84s)]
*  But you can't make the same products for the same price. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=213.84s)]
*  But if you have other countries charge tariffs, and I think we've charged tariffs in the past, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=215.52s)]
*  and it's an interesting thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=220.84s)]
*  It's like you make a trade agreement. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  It's essentially a trade agreement. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=223.68s)]
*  And his position has always been that one side of the trade agreement was unbalanced [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  and America does a stupid job in negotiating its trade agreements. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=229.2s)]
*  So he wants tariffs and everything. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=233.24s)]
*  That's what he threatened the guy from Colombia with. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=234.88s)]
*  He said, because they didn't want to take the prisoners, the flights were coming over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=238.88s)]
*  and he didn't want to give them approval to land. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=242.0s)]
*  He said, we're going to tax you, we're going to tariff you 25 percent, and then like in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  a week we're going to jack it up to 50 percent. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=247.48s)]
*  And this guy wrote like a poem to Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=250.48s)]
*  It was the most ridiculous thing ever. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  The guy's a wild dude. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=253.88s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=254.88s)]
*  It's like if you bring in the tariffs, you have to make them so high that the American [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=255.88s)]
*  goods were cheaper by comparison. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=260.36s)]
*  Well you'd have to really ramp up American manufacturing in a lot of places. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=262.0s)]
*  Like we don't make phones. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  That's one of the craziest things about America. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=267.52s)]
*  We can't make a phone. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=270.88s)]
*  We can't even make a phone. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=272.32s)]
*  We make mistakes. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=273.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, maybe we could make a phone. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=274.32s)]
*  Isn't there one phone that is made in America? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  Is there one phone that's manufactured here? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=280.32s)]
*  I think there is. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=282.0s)]
*  I mean, even if it's assembled here. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=283.0s)]
*  Is it the nothing phone? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=284.48s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=286.72s)]
*  I think it might be assembled here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=287.72s)]
*  I think they still have to get some. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=288.72s)]
*  They still have to get shit from China. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=289.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=290.72s)]
*  They have to get shit from Taiwan. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=291.72s)]
*  The key pieces. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=292.72s)]
*  They have to get shit from India. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=293.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=294.72s)]
*  Everybody gets their shit from somewhere. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=295.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=296.72s)]
*  I mean, like I said, the problem with American manufacturing is you can't do it for as cheap [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=297.72s)]
*  as you have to pay people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=302.04s)]
*  The problem is, first of all, we're addicted to buying new shit all the time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=304.36s)]
*  I have a bunch of phone lines, and one of my phone lines, I have an iPhone 11. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=309.36s)]
*  It's like five years old. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=315.6s)]
*  I don't notice when I'm using it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=317.04s)]
*  As long as it still works. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=320.6s)]
*  You don't notice on a normal experience. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=322.34000000000003s)]
*  What do I do with my phone? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=324.48s)]
*  I'm not fucking making complex video rendering. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=325.48s)]
*  You know, what am I doing? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=329.44s)]
*  I'm watching YouTube videos. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=330.44s)]
*  I'm text messaging people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=331.44s)]

*  If they start removing pesticides and herbicides and all these things that are killing people, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=498.44s)]
*  if people's health improves, if we remove things from the human diet, if just start [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=504.52s)]
*  educating people on the importance of diet and exercise, I would love to see that. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=508.84s)]
*  But you know the problem with that is we live in a society where like none of that shit's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=513.76s)]
*  going to happen unless they make more money than what we already doing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=517.44s)]
*  That's not necessarily true because you can motivate people. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=520.0s)]
*  in free motivation and having a government that's like promoting health in that way would [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=523.64s)]
*  cause a bunch of people to take that step that they've been thinking about taking. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=530.92s)]
*  So a lot of times motivation doesn't catch you flat. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=535.96s)]
*  Motivation catches you looking for motivation. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=539.28s)]

*  I just need something. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=546.88s)]
*  One day the government announces that we are going to turn the health of America around [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=548.36s)]
*  and we are going to promote a national fitness regime. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=554.96s)]
*  We're going to start bringing it to schools and kids to get people healthier. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=558.36s)]
*  We're going to bring in organic food and start feeding kids when you feed them in public [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=562.12s)]
*  schools and you have free lunches. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=566.68s)]
*  Did Michelle Obama try to do something like that? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=568.04s)]
*  Yes, she did. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=569.04s)]
*  She got shut down. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=570.04s)]
*  They shut her right the fuck down. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=571.04s)]
*  They sit down. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=573.04s)]
*  You're going to fucking kill our profits. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=574.04s)]
*  Fuck this healthy shit. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=577.32s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=578.32s)]
*  But what's different now than what was happening back then is we're so divided. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  If somebody in the government suggested anything was the healthiest thing, at least half the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  country would be like, I'm not fucking with it for that very reason. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=590.44s)]
*  You're so right. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=593.48s)]
*  They attached Obama to Obamacare even though it was not a bad thing. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=595.96s)]
*  And if Trump was like, hey, every American, jumping jacks is the best exercise. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=600.0s)]
*  He's doing no Trump jacks. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=605.28s)]
*  That's your president's exercise. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=607.64s)]
*  So it's like, we so divided, nothing's going to stick. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=608.88s)]
*  I also think that the problem with like health care and all these things where people are [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=612.4399999999999s)]
*  getting paid, you're dealing with a bunch of different games that are being played inside [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=618.0s)]
*  a game that has a function. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=625.56s)]
*  And that function is health care. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=628.64s)]
*  It provides health care in a kind of shifty, shitty way. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  But the game it's playing is make the most money. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=636.32s)]
*  That's the game it's playing. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=640.2s)]
*  It's playing a financial game. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=642.1600000000001s)]
*  That's why it's coming up with reasons to deny people and it's using AI to figure out [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=644.2s)]
*  how to deny people. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=649.12s)]
*  And they deny a large amount of claims. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=650.52s)]
*  So you got to look at it like what it actually is. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=652.6s)]
*  It's not that it's all bad, but that there's a bunch of different games. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=655.8000000000001s)]
*  Each person in that game is playing their own game. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=660.4s)]
*  You have thousands of employees. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=664.48s)]
*  You have thousands of people trying to climb the corporate ladder and make more money and [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=666.04s)]
*  get promotions and make more money for the company and impress the board. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=670.6s)]
*  They want a fucking yacht, bro. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=675.04s)]
*  I'm talking about how much we're divided, but it's weird. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=677.6800000000001s)]
*  That's the one thing they couldn't divide people on. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=681.2s)]
*  I remember after the CEO got popped on CNN and MSNBC and Fox, the narrative was how dare [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=684.1999999999999s)]
*  people be excited. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=693.88s)]
*  Because at first they tried to do what they do with everything and they said, oh, look [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=694.88s)]
*  at these liberals fucking laughing at death. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=699.12s)]
*  And then they realized, oh, the insurance industry has fucked over everybody. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=700.88s)]
*  They don't give a fuck who you voted for. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=705.16s)]
*  That might be the one. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=707.24s)]
*  Health care might be the one thing that we can come to like a bipartisan agreement on [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=708.52s)]
*  that health insurance and insurance companies in general, they're just captivated by what [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=713.24s)]
*  a corporation is. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=719.36s)]
*  A corporation has a responsibility to its shareholders to make the most money. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=721.08s)]
*  And they just that's a problem with the whole structure of it is that no matter what the [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=725.2s)]
*  business is, they find a way to make money more than they find a way to do the thing [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=729.12s)]
*  that they're supposed to be doing well as a service to people. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=733.92s)]
*  If Trump actually fixed health care, he would go down as one of the greatest presidents. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=736.92s)]
*  He would be like, it would be, I think it would be a whole different, like he actually [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=743.52s)]
*  did like viable, real change to the health care system that like made it work for everybody. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=747.56s)]
*  Well, it used to be that there was no social media. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=753.88s)]
*  So if you wanted to make a big change, the government could gaslight you on TV in these [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=757.24s)]
*  press conferences and bring out experts and they could gaslight you and tell you what [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=762.26s)]
*  to do. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=766.7s)]
*  And that was all the information you had. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=767.7s)]
*  That doesn't work anymore. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=769.7800000000001s)]
*  It doesn't work anymore. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=772.1800000000001s)]
*  So this is one of the reasons why this is the best time ever to kind of revamp health [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=773.5s)]
*  care and revamp like the way people think about what is healthy, what is healthy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=777.74s)]
*  How are you going to revamp it in a way that still makes money? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=781.94s)]
*  You well, it doesn't have to. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  First of all, first of all, you're going to lose money. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=786.0600000000001s)]
*  The country is going to lose money. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=788.4200000000001s)]
*  It's like who's going to get the money. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=790.26s)]
*  There's an exchange of money, right? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=791.6600000000001s)]
*  So if a lot of people are sick all the time and a lot of people are on Medicaid and a [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=793.2s)]
*  lot of people are on health insurance, the country is going to spend more money that's [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=798.48s)]
*  going to go to pharmaceutical drug companies. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=803.36s)]
*  But it doesn't have to go there. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=806.0400000000001s)]
*  We can't commit to giving it to them every year just because they figured out a way to [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=807.9200000000001s)]
*  keep getting it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=812.12s)]
*  That's dumb. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=813.36s)]
*  The right way to say is we have to look at the collective money of the country. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=814.4000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't it be way better if we spent way less on health care because people got healthier [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=819.48s)]
*  because they figured out there's no easy way to do it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=825.6s)]
*  You have to have diet and exercise. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=828.12s)]
*  It's the most important foundation for any healthy human being. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=830.1s)]
*  It doesn't matter what kind of exercise. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=833.28s)]
*  It probably doesn't even matter what kind of diet as long as you're like committed to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=835.48s)]
*  eating healthy real food. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=839.92s)]
*  The whole thing is just diet and exercise and movement. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=842.0s)]
*  That would fucking cure 70% of the problems we have in this country with health care because [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=845.84s)]
*  people would be healthy. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=851.88s)]
*  And so then you wouldn't be as susceptible to getting sick. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=853.36s)]
*  You wouldn't be as susceptible to getting injured. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=856.28s)]
*  There's a bunch of things that would probably likely stack up financially in our favor. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=858.68s)]
*  So that's how you make money out of it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=864.08s)]
*  You make money out of it because everybody makes more money. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=865.88s)]
*  You make more money if you're healthy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=869.38s)]
*  You make more money if you're active. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=870.88s)]
*  If you're in the bed all the time because you have back surgery constantly or if you've [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=873.08s)]
*  got this and that and you've got a lot of interruptions in your life, they're going [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=876.32s)]
*  to hiccup your career. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=879.5600000000001s)]
*  They're going to hiccup whatever you're trying to accomplish in your life if you're dealing [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  with being sick all the time. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  So you think if people were healthier, they would deny less people? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  I think if people were healthier, first of all, you would need way less health care. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=889.72s)]
*  That's the number one thing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=894.88s)]
*  If people were fit and they took care of themselves, there's a giant part of if you looked at all [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=896.0200000000001s)]
*  the health care issues that we have in this country, there's a giant chunk of it that's [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=903.0600000000001s)]
*  connected to diet. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=907.1s)]
*  It's connected to the standard American diet. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=908.62s)]
*  It's connected to eating too much calories, garbage food, obesity. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=910.62s)]
*  All that is possible to shift that in a different direction. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=915.86s)]
*  You just have to change the way people eat and that you would see other people getting [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=920.34s)]
*  results and then you would want those results. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=925.1800000000001s)]
*  If you hear RFK Jr. on TV trying to motivate people to do this and you see him working [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=927.74s)]
*  out, maybe that's the thing you need that takes you from, man, I got to go to the gym [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=933.66s)]
*  one day. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=937.46s)]
*  Fuck it, I'm going to the gym. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=938.46s)]
*  This is it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=939.46s)]
*  Then if more people do that, there's more healthy people. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=940.46s)]
*  If there's more healthy people, there's less losers. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=943.0600000000001s)]
*  If there's less losers, the country makes more money. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=945.26s)]
*  The whole GDP goes up. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=947.3s)]
*  You're going to do better. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=950.74s)]
*  You're going to do better with whatever you're doing in life if you're healthy because health [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=951.74s)]
*  is energy. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=955.62s)]
*  But how do you make people want like? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=956.62s)]
*  You don't make them do it, but you inspire. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=958.22s)]
*  The government has never done that before. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  Why not try it? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=963.74s)]
*  Why not try that? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=965.38s)]
*  Why not try that? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=966.38s)]
*  Why not try to like fucking gaslight people until you got to wear a mask in your car or [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=967.38s)]
*  you're going to die instead of that gaslighting? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=970.98s)]
*  How about pump them up? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=973.22s)]
*  They scared the fuck out of everybody with COVID. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=974.92s)]
*  How about they pump everybody the fuck up with health? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=976.9s)]
*  If government wanted everybody to do anything, they have to pay them. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=979.1s)]
*  You know another problem with my theory? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=984.24s)]
*  I give you a tax break if you lose 40 pounds. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=985.24s)]

*  Like, okay, I don't know what to tell you. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=997.62s)]
*  If he came back, if he disappeared for like six months and came back just jacked. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=999.46s)]
*  Jacked, shaved his head. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1002.98s)]
*  Did you see him play tennis with Serena Williams? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1004.34s)]
*  No. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1006.34s)]

*  She's not going to embarrass him. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1015.22s)]
*  No, obviously not that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1016.7800000000001s)]
*  They're volleying back and forth and he's playing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1017.7800000000001s)]
*  Is he running? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1019.86s)]
*  He plays tennis, man. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1020.86s)]

*  It looks like he's doing it the right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1029.7s)]
*  He doesn't look like me. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1030.7s)]

*  They need a purpose or they need something that occupies their brains. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1082.78s)]

*  I just don't want to do it. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1093.3s)]

*  I don't know what to say. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1107.06s)]
*  But he probably also has zero stress. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1108.5s)]
*  Well, he has a way of letting shit roll off his back. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1110.62s)]
*  I mean, he had to have some stress and that guy shot at him. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1113.46s)]

*  It's like, is this a movie? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1120.46s)]
*  Are we in a movie? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1121.94s)]
*  Is this like a simulation? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1123.26s)]
*  And then his ear healed up like Wolverine. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1124.26s)]
*  Bro. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1125.82s)]
*  He healed up pretty quick. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1126.82s)]
*  You can see a little mark on it. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1127.82s)]
*  You see there's a little tiny. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1128.82s)]
*  If you look at it, like when he was right there, I go, let me see it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1129.82s)]
*  And he leaned in. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1132.1799999999998s)]
*  You could kind of see. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1133.1799999999998s)]
*  You know, the ears filled with blood vessels. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1134.1799999999998s)]
*  That's why I bleed so much. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1136.38s)]
*  Nobody talks about it anymore. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1137.38s)]
*  No. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1138.8600000000001s)]
*  You know what else nobody talks about? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1139.8600000000001s)]
*  The guy who blew up the cyber truck in front of Trump Tower. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1141.26s)]
*  What happened to that guy? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1144.66s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1145.66s)]
*  You don't know that story? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1146.66s)]
*  I don't follow any of the pop political stuff. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1147.66s)]
*  Well, this isn't even political. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1149.7s)]
*  This is a weird story. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1151.08s)]
*  It's a guy who was like, now, has it been confirmed that that's him? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1152.82s)]
*  Let's pull up the story because I don't want to do it any misjustice. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1158.58s)]
*  But this was after the election, correct? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1162.52s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1165.9399999999998s)]
*  It was real recent. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1166.9399999999998s)]
*  New Year's Day. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1167.9399999999998s)]
*  OK, New Year's Day. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1168.9399999999998s)]
*  That's how crazy the news cycle is. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1170.78s)]
*  Like you forget what day things happened. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1172.1799999999998s)]
*  Like was that a year ago? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1174.6999999999998s)]
*  No, it was last week. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1175.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1176.6999999999998s)]

*  So this dude. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1180.78s)]
*  That dude? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1181.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1182.78s)]
*  What is the story behind him? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1183.78s)]
*  He was a Special Forces guy, right? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1184.78s)]
*  And he was in, I think he was in a television show with Tim Kennedy. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1185.98s)]
*  They had like a Special Forces TV show where they did something. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1189.86s)]
*  So this guy's like, you know, he's an operator. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1195.38s)]
*  He's like a serious soldier. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1197.3400000000001s)]
*  Why a cyber truck? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1199.0200000000002s)]
*  And he allegedly committed suicide with a large handgun, a Desert Eagle. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1200.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh, he rented it. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1209.38s)]
*  OK. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1211.42s)]
*  Large handgun and blew up this thing. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1212.42s)]
*  It says self-inflicted gunshot wound. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1215.5800000000002s)]
*  The whole thing's weird, man. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1219.14s)]
*  Nobody could imagine him doing this. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1221.54s)]
*  Everybody's saying it doesn't make sense. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1226.46s)]
*  Why would he? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1228.98s)]
*  This guy knew how to make bombs. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1229.98s)]
*  Why would he make a shitty bomb like that that doesn't even blow up the building? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1231.68s)]
*  It just blows him up in the car. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1236.18s)]
*  And why would he do it in a cyber truck, which is like the most durable car you can buy? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1239.1399999999999s)]
*  Like that whole thing. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1243.54s)]
*  The cyber truck. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1245.06s)]
*  You saw that video where I tried to shoot an arrow through it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1246.06s)]
*  My arrow exploded. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1248.94s)]
*  That thing's solid steel. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1250.66s)]
*  So why would you blow yourself up in a solid? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1252.5s)]
*  You would get a convertible and fuck everybody up, right? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1255.0600000000002s)]
*  If you're going to blow up yourself in a car and you want to do the most damage, you'd [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1259.74s)]
*  have a car that you'd want to blow apart. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1263.94s)]
*  Those Teslas contain the entire explosion. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1266.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1268.94s)]
*  I mean, did he leave some kind of manifesto? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1269.94s)]
*  I don't know if he left a note. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1273.3000000000002s)]
*  Did he leave a note? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1274.6200000000001s)]
*  I think so. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1275.6200000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1276.6200000000001s)]
*  They probably found it like barely smoldering outside. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1277.6999999999998s)]
*  Look it's like, remember when they found the terrorist passports, the planes went into [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1281.1799999999998s)]
*  the fucking World Trade Center, blew up in front of everybody's face, just a gigantic, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  enormous pile of fire. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1292.2199999999998s)]
*  And yet this dude's passport just barely singed on the outside like a Bugs Bunny cartoon falls [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1294.9799999999998s)]
*  to the ground. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1300.8999999999999s)]
*  That's what the whole Sean Ryan thing was about because they sent the email and then [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1301.8999999999999s)]
*  it was, did the guy write the email? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1305.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1307.58s)]

*  That's right. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1310.58s)]
*  Now I remember. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1311.58s)]
*  God, I forgot Sean Ryan was involved in that. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1312.58s)]
*  And then people were saying that he didn't, that guy didn't send that to you. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1313.58s)]
*  You got hoaxed. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1315.78s)]
*  And then Sean Ryan proved that the guy did send that. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1316.78s)]
*  So he was saying some stuff in there about drones and what was he saying? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1319.82s)]
*  Let's put up what he said. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1324.98s)]
*  You know what I realized, man? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1325.98s)]
*  Shout out to Sean Ryan. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1327.3s)]
*  It said, in case I do not make it to my decision point or onto the Mexican, Mexico border, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1329.4199999999998s)]

*  First off, I'm not under duress or hostile influence or control. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1343.46s)]
*  My first car was a 2006 black Ford Mustang V6 for verification. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1347.1399999999999s)]

*  That was not his first car. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1352.8999999999999s)]
*  No, no, he had a different car. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1353.8999999999999s)]
*  We'll find that out in a second. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1355.86s)]
*  Put a tab on that, Jamie. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1357.62s)]
*  What we have been seeing with drones is the operational use of gravitic propulsion systems [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1359.6599999999999s)]

*  recently has picked up. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1381.1000000000001s)]
*  As of now, it is just a show of force and they are using it similar to how they use [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1382.6200000000001s)]
*  the balloon for SIGINT. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1387.26s)]
*  SIGINT? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1389.86s)]
*  How do you say that? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1390.86s)]
*  SIGINT? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1392.74s)]

*  So what is because of the speed and stealth of these unmanned aircraft, they are the most [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1402.62s)]
*  dangerous threat to national security that has ever existed. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1408.1399999999999s)]

*  So where's the recording of public records that was not his first car? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1978.98s)]
*  Well, show us the public records. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1982.8200000000002s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1986.1000000000001s)]
*  It was a BMW 2008. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1988.38s)]
*  One series BMW. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1991.8600000000001s)]
*  I would add, wouldn't this just be registered under his name? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1993.38s)]
*  Maybe he borrowed one. Maybe his parents registered it. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1995.98s)]
*  I think they checked his parents' cards, too. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1998.02s)]
*  What about that 1998 is a Ford Mustang? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=1999.42s)]
*  But it's 2006. It's a big difference. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2001.78s)]
*  See right here. Why is Sean Ryan spreading an easily confirmed fake email? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2004.3000000000002s)]
*  If your first car was a 1998 Mustang, would you say your first car was a 2007 Mustang? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2008.18s)]
*  The dates don't even line up. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2013.8200000000002s)]
*  So he had a 98 Ford Mustang. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2015.1000000000001s)]
*  Why is the BMW circled? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2018.02s)]
*  Because, you see, the thing is, whenever weird shit happened, the first people to talk be full of shit. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2020.42s)]
*  They were those they were worse people. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2024.8200000000002s)]
*  So it looks like he didn't have he had scrolled that back again. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2026.5800000000002s)]
*  So he had a 98 Mustang, not a 2007. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2029.98s)]
*  That was his first car. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2034.5800000000002s)]
*  Then he had a 2008 BMW. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2036.02s)]
*  And then he had a Jeep. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2038.78s)]
*  He never had a 2006 Mustang. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2040.8600000000001s)]
*  You can see right where he got divorced because he got a Mustang again. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2043.22s)]
*  I'm back, baby. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2046.34s)]
*  Twenty eighteen. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2048.14s)]
*  Twenty eighteen. He got a Ford Mustang GT. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2049.18s)]
*  That's that midlife crisis. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2051.34s)]
*  You got the GT, too. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2052.42s)]
*  Greg Fitzsimmons got it. He got it with the EcoBoost. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2054.26s)]
*  He was telling me how much he loves it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2056.26s)]
*  I know, but you didn't get the V8. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2057.82s)]
*  He's like, oh, gas mileage. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2060.18s)]
*  I'm like, shut your mouth. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2061.62s)]
*  What do you mean EcoBoost? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2063.22s)]
*  Oh, it's a great engine. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2064.54s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. It's got plenty of power. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2066.26s)]
*  In comparison to old cars, it's way more powerful. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2067.86s)]
*  I mean, it's a fast fucking car. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2070.26s)]
*  But the EcoBoost is just more fuel efficient. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2071.98s)]
*  It doesn't have the same horsepower. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2075.26s)]
*  And the GT has the Coyote V8 that has that rumble. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2077.42s)]
*  Makes you feel alive. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2082.86s)]
*  You know, when you rumble, rumble. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2084.78s)]
*  You ever been in a red light with a guy in a Mustang and they take off [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2086.74s)]
*  and you hear that sound, especially if he's got a manual? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2090.06s)]
*  No, my my my homie, when I was in the service, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2092.3399999999997s)]

*  Yeah, it was definitely like a 70 something. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2106.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? It was like an old the cool ones. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2110.5s)]
*  Yeah, but it was like no modern technology in this motherfucker. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2113.54s)]
*  It was loud as shit. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2116.18s)]
*  Corvettes are the only cars that looked good into the 70s. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2117.54s)]
*  All the other American cars turned to dog shit. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2121.22s)]
*  They turned to, they became boxes. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2124.56s)]
*  They became fuel efficient boxes. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2127.14s)]

*  And then eventually they fucked that up too. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2130.56s)]
*  And they made Corvettes like flat and look like a wedge. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2132.8799999999997s)]
*  They looked so stupid for a while, but now they're back. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2136.48s)]

*  and then it didn't land on apartment buildings. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2375.78s)]

*  and you don't know where the planes are? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2571.2s)]
*  That seems insane. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2573.96s)]
*  That doesn't even seem possible [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2575.3799999999997s)]
*  because how could you exist as a military aircraft [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2576.66s)]
*  if you don't have a comprehensive analysis [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2579.46s)]
*  of everything that's around you all the time? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2581.22s)]
*  We have sensors. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2582.8199999999997s)]
*  We put them on jets. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2584.02s)]
*  Why wouldn't we put sensors on the helicopter? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2585.02s)]
*  They probably do have them. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2587.46s)]
*  So why didn't it work? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2588.42s)]
*  Wow, we're gonna find out pretty soon. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2590.1s)]
*  Will we even know? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2592.02s)]
*  Or we'll never find out. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2592.8599999999997s)]
*  But everybody's dead, right? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2593.7s)]
*  So how do you know when everybody's dead? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2594.52s)]
*  They think the pilots are dead of the helicopter. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2596.1s)]
*  I believe there was, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2599.18s)]
*  was there supposed to be two people in the helicopter? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2600.02s)]
*  Four, three? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2602.3399999999997s)]
*  Three people in the helicopter? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2603.2999999999997s)]
*  Was it like 60 or 70 people? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2605.3999999999996s)]
*  60 people in the plane are dead. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2607.72s)]
*  Damn, only 60 people on the flight? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2611.04s)]
*  Small flight. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2612.72s)]
*  Yeah, I guess it was mostly a figure skating team. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2613.56s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2617.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, because that's the thing. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2618.68s)]
*  I was saying, it would have to be a group of people. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2620.0s)]
*  Because if they just wanted to take out one person, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2621.48s)]
*  why waste a helicopter? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2623.68s)]
*  Like, there's better ways to kill one person. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2625.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2628.44s)]
*  Well, also, you want the worst press possible. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2629.48s)]
*  Kill a plane filled with young figure skaters. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2633.14s)]
*  The sweetest, most delicate people. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2637.2599999999998s)]
*  Like twirling around on the ice. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2639.44s)]
*  I mean, when we think of them, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2641.3399999999997s)]
*  they're almost like super humans. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2642.58s)]
*  We don't even want to think about, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2646.06s)]
*  that's why when that Tonya Harding, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2646.9s)]
*  Nancy Kerrigan shit went down, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2648.8599999999997s)]
*  nobody even wanted to believe it's possible. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2650.3399999999997s)]
*  The figure skating community's got thugs? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2651.92s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2655.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2655.92s)]
*  The figure skating community tries to take out people [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2656.74s)]
*  by breaking their knees? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2659.3599999999997s)]
*  And that shit was ripe for comedy for like five years. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2660.42s)]
*  Yeah, people get vicious about shit, man. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2663.7200000000003s)]
*  People get vicious. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2666.6400000000003s)]
*  But here's the other thing. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2667.76s)]
*  It might just be incompetence. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2672.6400000000003s)]
*  Most likely it's incompetence. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2674.48s)]
*  Somebody was just fucked up. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2675.8s)]
*  Most likely someone made a mistake, most likely. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2677.2400000000002s)]
*  But in this day and age, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2680.2000000000003s)]
*  when you know about things that have happened, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2681.32s)]
*  you know about false flags, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2683.4s)]
*  you know about all kinds of shit that happens, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2684.8s)]
*  you always gotta wonder. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2686.48s)]
*  And if we do find out, here's worst case scenario. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2687.6000000000004s)]
*  What if a foreign government has figured out a way [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2691.1s)]
*  to hack into our equipment [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2693.98s)]
*  and they can get a helicopter to fly right into a plane? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2697.5s)]
*  Oh, like this was a test run? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2700.74s)]
*  What if this was like proof of concept? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2701.74s)]
*  See, I think a better conspiracy would be [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2703.38s)]
*  if we found out that it was like Delta was behind it. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2705.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2711.02s)]
*  Delta tried to take out American Airlines? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2711.86s)]
*  Or like Alaska was like, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2712.86s)]
*  yo, we gonna fucking ruin their reputation. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2714.14s)]
*  But if you were a foreign country [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2716.7799999999997s)]
*  and you wanted to demonstrate [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2718.58s)]
*  that you have technical superiority over people, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2720.32s)]
*  how would you do it? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2723.26s)]
*  Well, first of all, you'd lay the groundwork, right? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2724.1400000000003s)]
*  This is one thing they definitely did, right? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2727.34s)]
*  Where's the highlighter, bro? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2729.02s)]
*  Got that? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2730.5s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2731.34s)]
*  You lay the groundwork, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  and the groundwork is sell them all the shit they need. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2733.1000000000004s)]
*  Sell them all the shit they need. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2737.02s)]
*  And some of the shit you sell them, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2738.38s)]
*  put a little back door in there. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2739.98s)]
*  Put a little back door in there. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2742.56s)]
*  And they've been doing that. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2743.78s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2744.82s)]
*  That's why Huawei was banned from the United States. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2745.6400000000003s)]
*  They banned Huawei phones. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2749.28s)]
*  They were the most sophisticated phones. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2751.2400000000002s)]
*  They were coming out of China. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2752.92s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2753.76s)]
*  It was great. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2754.6s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2755.42s)]
*  I've taught this before. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2757.04s)]
*  Forgive me if you heard it before, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2758.2400000000002s)]
*  but I tried to buy a Porsche design Huawei phone. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2759.2400000000002s)]
*  It was an amazing phone. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2763.36s)]
*  It was like so much more advanced than iPhones. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2764.56s)]
*  It had a bigger battery. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2766.7200000000003s)]
*  It had like a hundred megapixel camera. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2767.92s)]
*  And then right before it was coming out, they put the ban. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2770.36s)]
*  And then there was all these national security concerns, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2773.4s)]
*  and Huawei is like spying on Americans. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2775.96s)]
*  And something about their routers and their systems, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2779.2000000000003s)]
*  they figured out there's like back door possibilities [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2781.0s)]
*  that were engineered into these things. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2783.6400000000003s)]
*  So they sold us cell phone towers and computer chips [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2785.36s)]
*  and all this stuff and all the components [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2789.7400000000002s)]
*  that you need to run your AI. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2792.06s)]

*  they're integrated into it physically, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2801.34s)]

*  This was the guy who was a journalist [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2857.04s)]
*  who was writing for Rolling Stone, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2858.7599999999998s)]
*  and he goes over to Afghanistan? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2860.88s)]
*  Was it Afghanistan? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2863.48s)]
*  Goes over to Afghanistan and gets stuck there [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2864.84s)]
*  because of the volcano. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2870.04s)]
*  So the volcano in Iceland, I think, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2871.7200000000003s)]
*  so this volcano blows up [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2874.32s)]
*  and the sky's covered with dirt. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2876.0s)]
*  You can't see for weeks, so you can't fly. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2877.8s)]
*  So he can't leave there. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2880.88s)]
*  So he gets stuck with his troop. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2882.2000000000003s)]
*  He's embedded with these troops. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2884.2400000000002s)]
*  And they get loose. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2886.2000000000003s)]
*  They get loose. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2887.48s)]
*  They start saying things. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2888.32s)]
*  They start talking shit about Obama. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2889.1400000000003s)]
*  The general talks shit about Obama. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2890.8s)]
*  And then this guy puts all this in the story. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2892.74s)]
*  And he puts all this in the, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2895.54s)]
*  they thought he was like one of their homies. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2896.74s)]

*  We're just boys. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2898.8199999999997s)]
*  He's not gonna write about that. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2899.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, that guy wrote about all that shit. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2901.06s)]
*  You get these 20-year-old kids. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2902.58s)]

*  So he has to step down. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2913.54s)]
*  And he, the general, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2914.8399999999997s)]
*  is one of the most beloved generals in the military. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2916.14s)]
*  And then this guy is terrified for his life. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2918.3799999999997s)]
*  And his old, the reporter. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2921.54s)]
*  The reporter's terrified for his life. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2923.04s)]
*  Because he's been threatened. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2925.08s)]
*  So then he dies on, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2927.32s)]
*  was it Laurel Canyon? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2930.92s)]

*  Either way. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2943.76s)]
*  Either way. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2944.6s)]
*  Point is, he's in LA. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2945.42s)]
*  He's going like 120 miles an hour. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2946.96s)]
*  And he goes straight into a tree and the car explodes. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2949.04s)]
*  The car explodes and hit, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2951.38s)]

*  Look at this. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2954.06s)]
*  He just hits the gas and boom. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2957.38s)]
*  Runs into a tree and explodes. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2960.2400000000002s)]
*  Had said, you know, if anything happens, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2964.5s)]
*  I didn't kill myself. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2967.34s)]
*  And then the question was, back then, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2972.1s)]
*  so was this 2005? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2974.42s)]
*  2013. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2976.2200000000003s)]
*  2013. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2977.06s)]
*  So back then the question was, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2977.96s)]
*  do they have the technology to take over vehicles? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2979.98s)]
*  And if you ask people that are honest, the answer is yes. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2984.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2988.28s)]
*  There's a way to do it. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2989.12s)]
*  It's not impossible. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2990.4s)]
*  It's not like, you know, breathing underwater. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2991.28s)]
*  It's, it can be done. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2993.68s)]
*  Whether you have to get access to the actual car itself [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2995.72s)]
*  and put something in there, I don't know. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=2999.0s)]
*  But it can be done. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3001.0s)]
*  That's why people, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3002.48s)]
*  like it's going to be a couple generations [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3006.08s)]
*  before people will be down with it [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3007.58s)]
*  being fully autonomous cars. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3009.9s)]
*  Like, you know, we see all these driverless cars [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3011.94s)]
*  around this motherfucker all the time. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3013.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's like, I ain't getting in one of them motherfuckers. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3015.18s)]
*  You'll get the fuck out of here. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3017.18s)]
*  No way. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3018.02s)]
*  But, but, cause if they wanted to kill you, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3018.86s)]
*  I mean, we saw that in the old, the new Total Recall. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3020.7s)]
*  They did that, where it's like, [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3023.34s)]
*  all the cars drive themselves. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3024.38s)]
*  But when they want to find you, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3026.5s)]
*  they fucking stop your car, pull you over, you know? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3027.34s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3029.7s)]
*  Well, everybody's terrified about that. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3030.54s)]
*  You know? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3032.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's cars right now that they could shut off. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3033.18s)]
*  If there's a police chase, that's what OnStar does. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3038.36s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3041.32s)]
*  So, like if you're in one of those Corvettes, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3042.1600000000003s)]
*  I bet that Corvette has OnStar. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3043.8s)]
*  Does that Corvette have OnStar? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3046.8s)]
*  So the way they sell you OnStar is they say, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3048.2000000000003s)]
*  well, Brian, if someone steals your car, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3050.6800000000003s)]
*  we can just shut it off. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3054.08s)]
*  And you're like, oh, that would be good. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3055.8s)]
*  I don't want anybody stealing my beautiful car. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3057.12s)]
*  But the other side of that is, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3059.62s)]
*  we could also just shut it off for other reasons. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3061.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3063.6s)]
*  We can shut it off because we don't like you. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3064.44s)]
*  And we just decide to shut your car off. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3067.58s)]
*  But don't worry, it says right here that that's illegal. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3068.42s)]
*  You could have the wrong political opinion, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3070.2599999999998s)]
*  depending on who's in power. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3072.1s)]
*  You know, you want to give these people power [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3073.4s)]
*  because you don't want the other side to win. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3074.84s)]
*  But then the problem is, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3076.16s)]
*  now you've established that the government, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3077.8199999999997s)]
*  which is not always you, is going to have power. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3079.94s)]

*  It's just the dumbest. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3139.46s)]
*  But you get these kids that are willing to do these drug runs, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3140.7799999999997s)]
*  and they're cocky, and they're probably using. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3144.3399999999997s)]
*  So they're probably taking a little amphetamines [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3147.14s)]
*  while they're driving to stay sharp, Brian. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3149.3399999999997s)]
*  Can't get sleepy behind the wheel. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3151.74s)]
*  And they're probably not the most reliable people anyway. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3153.84s)]
*  They're literal drug runners. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3156.52s)]
*  What they're doing can get them locked up [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3158.6800000000003s)]
*  for the rest of their fucking life, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3160.1600000000003s)]
*  and they're probably gonna make $2,000 for doing this. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3161.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and they'll have some cool stories. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3164.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, who's gonna make the money? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3166.32s)]
*  They're probably doing it for somebody else. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3167.6400000000003s)]
*  They're probably moving it for somebody. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3169.56s)]
*  And they have to sell it, and then they get a piece, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3171.44s)]
*  and then they keep doing it, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3173.48s)]
*  and they just have to hope they don't get arrested. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3175.6400000000003s)]
*  And then they do it a few times, get a little cocky. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3178.4s)]
*  I mean, someone's bringing all this shit in. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3181.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, how's it getting in? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3183.3799999999997s)]
*  How many, if you're a cop, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3184.62s)]
*  and you're just out there looking around all the year, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3185.8199999999997s)]
*  how many of these moving trucks have fentanyl in them? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3187.18s)]
*  I think the CIA bringing most of it. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3189.02s)]
*  A bit of it, for sure. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3191.02s)]
*  Because who stops selling drugs [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3192.8599999999997s)]
*  when they get away with it? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3194.22s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3195.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3196.02s)]
*  Why would they stop doing that? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3196.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3197.74s)]
*  Now they just know how to not get caught. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3198.58s)]
*  Well, maybe they probably work with people. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3200.62s)]
*  Because please believe, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3202.54s)]
*  if we really, really wanted to stop drugs, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3203.74s)]
*  it would be extreme, but we could, but we don't want to. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3206.8999999999996s)]
*  It would be too hard. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3209.58s)]
*  You'd have to take away too much freedom from people. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3210.4199999999996s)]
*  They wouldn't stand for it, and they'd vote you out of office. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3212.64s)]
*  Also, they'd stop it from coming in the country. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3214.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3215.9s)]
*  You could stop it from coming in the country, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3216.74s)]
*  but you're not going to stop a demand. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3218.22s)]
*  The real problem is, just like the prohibition of alcohol, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3219.7799999999997s)]
*  and I'm not comparing meth with alcohol, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3222.94s)]
*  because I think most people, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3224.94s)]
*  most people that I know responsibly use alcohol. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3227.1s)]
*  They take a few drinks. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3229.56s)]
*  I mean, I know a bunch of people who have abused it. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3230.9s)]
*  I know a bunch of people who had to stop drinking. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3232.7s)]
*  But most guys that we're friends with, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3235.3399999999997s)]
*  you have a drink, you guys want to do a shot? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3237.7s)]
*  Let's do a shot, yeah. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3239.42s)]
*  And then you go do your show, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3240.2599999999998s)]
*  and no one's getting drunk every night. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3241.96s)]
*  Right, I don't really see anybody drunk. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3243.28s)]
*  But if you're out there doing meth, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3245.1600000000003s)]
*  there's a chance you're not engaging [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3248.1600000000003s)]
*  in like responsible meth use. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3250.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a good chance if you're using meth, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3254.1600000000003s)]
*  you're going hard. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3257.04s)]
*  Or just microdosing. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3257.88s)]
*  You're just going, no, no one ain't microdosing meth. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3258.84s)]
*  They're going hard. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3261.6000000000004s)]
*  I think meth gets you to go hard. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3262.7400000000002s)]
*  You're listening to fucking Slayer in your car, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3264.6000000000004s)]
*  and you're fired up, and you're making bad decisions. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3267.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you're definitely just not thinking. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3270.58s)]
*  You're just doing. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3272.58s)]
*  But what is Adderall? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3273.4199999999996s)]
*  Adderall's super close to meth. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3274.62s)]
*  Super close. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3276.4199999999996s)]
*  It's an amphetamine, for sure. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3277.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's not the same. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3279.14s)]
*  But it's in the hunt. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3280.98s)]
*  People do wild shit on that shit, too. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3284.4599999999996s)]
*  Especially if you take a lot of it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3285.8599999999997s)]
*  If you take a lot of it, it might as well be meth. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3287.14s)]
*  And people abuse the shit out of everything. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3289.02s)]
*  You tell them to take one, they're going to take five or six. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3291.1s)]
*  I think the biggest problem is like, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3293.14s)]
*  most people's lives suck so bad [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3294.22s)]
*  that drugs is their only thing. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3297.84s)]
*  That's true, too. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3301.2000000000003s)]
*  Because that's instant happiness. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3303.04s)]
*  That's true. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3305.1600000000003s)]
*  Because you know what's so funny is, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3306.0s)]
*  I think a lot of people assume that most of the homeless [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3308.6400000000003s)]
*  people on the street are homeless [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3312.1200000000003s)]
*  because they had a drug problem. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3314.88s)]
*  But it's usually the other way around. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3317.4s)]
*  They usually are fine when they hit the street, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3318.7200000000003s)]
*  and they start using drugs. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3321.04s)]
*  Because what else the fuck you going to do? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3322.92s)]
*  Where else you going to get happiness from? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3324.6400000000003s)]
*  You're not warm, you're not safe. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3325.94s)]
*  Well, there's probably a bunch of different scenarios there, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3328.34s)]
*  but a lot of it has to do with drug use. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3330.66s)]
*  And a lot of it has to do with self-medicating. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3332.82s)]
*  A lot of those people are just like severely mentally ill [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3335.02s)]
*  and really should be in some sort of an institution. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3337.54s)]
*  People are never going to stop getting high. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3340.14s)]
*  No, they're not going to. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3342.48s)]
*  I'm smoking a cigar right now. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3344.54s)]
*  And I don't know what the solution is [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3346.02s)]
*  or just legalize everything. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3349.46s)]
*  I don't know that either. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3351.02s)]
*  I would have said that five years ago, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3351.86s)]
*  but maybe that is the ultimate solution, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3353.54s)]
*  but the way it's implemented, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3358.0s)]
*  because I think they tried that in Seattle or Portland. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3359.68s)]
*  Yeah, they had to stop it. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3362.4s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's like, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3363.36s)]
*  but they also just went from what we're doing now [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3364.56s)]
*  to just everything's legal. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3366.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, but they also, it's Portland. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3368.52s)]
*  They're ridiculous. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3370.84s)]
*  Those people are ridiculous. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3372.2799999999997s)]
*  That was Seattle, right? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3373.56s)]
*  No, was it Portland or Seattle? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3375.64s)]
*  Which one was it that, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3377.7599999999998s)]
*  it was Oregon that legalized everything, right? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3378.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3381.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it was Oregon. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3382.6s)]
*  It was Portland. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3384.34s)]
*  Portland's ridiculous. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3385.18s)]
*  They're ridiculous. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3386.0s)]
*  So if you just say you can just do drugs [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3386.84s)]
*  wherever you want, just do whatever you want, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3388.94s)]
*  everything's legal now, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3390.38s)]
*  everyone's just going to be brazen about it. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3391.54s)]
*  You've got a culture that was demonized for so long, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3393.66s)]
*  and you have a culture of mental illness [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3398.3s)]
*  where people are looking for something [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3401.52s)]
*  to get them out of this rut that they're in. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3403.06s)]
*  And the only thing that makes them feel good [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3405.4s)]
*  is fentanyl or oxycodone or whatever the fuck they're taking. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3406.86s)]
*  Whatever that shit that makes you lean over. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3410.46s)]
*  What's that stuff? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3412.84s)]
*  It's a lot of shit to do that. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3413.6800000000003s)]
*  The stuff that, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3414.88s)]
*  what they're doing, yoga in the street? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3415.7200000000003s)]
*  Trank? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3417.4s)]
*  Trank's on my guy, I think. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3418.2400000000002s)]
*  Whatever the fuck they're doing, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3419.44s)]
*  these people, they're trying to escape, right? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3420.4s)]
*  And the idea that you just leave them, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3424.32s)]
*  they're obviously severely mentally ill. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3426.84s)]
*  If we spend money on people with illness, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3428.88s)]
*  why don't we spend money on people with mental illness? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3431.48s)]
*  It seems like if you want to support Medicaid, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3433.96s)]
*  shouldn't you support mass medical assistance [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3435.6000000000004s)]
*  to most of these people? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3441.2999999999997s)]
*  Because a lot of them are probably severely mentally ill [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3443.74s)]
*  and unmedicated, and maybe they can be helped. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3446.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe someone can take them into an institution. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3449.02s)]
*  Is somebody calling you a socialist right now [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3451.58s)]
*  in the comments? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3453.22s)]
*  I am in a lot of ways. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3454.06s)]
*  I am, with some things, like the fire department. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3455.38s)]
*  I think the fire department is a very socialist idea. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3458.2999999999997s)]
*  We're all gonna put our money into this one group of people [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3461.46s)]
*  that's gonna act in the best interest [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3465.68s)]
*  of the entire community and put out fires everywhere, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3467.18s)]
*  regardless of who's got money or doesn't. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3469.22s)]
*  Like if you're a poor person and you live on this block [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3471.2s)]
*  and your house catches on fire, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3473.16s)]
*  they don't say, we're not gonna put that fire out. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3474.48s)]
*  We're only gonna put the big guy's fire out. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3476.8799999999997s)]
*  No, the fucking house gets on fire, everybody agrees. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3478.68s)]
*  That fire needs to get put out so the fire people move. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3482.16s)]
*  You spend your tax dollars on that. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3485.2s)]
*  See, that's how I feel about healthcare. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3486.04s)]
*  It's true. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3488.4399999999996s)]
*  That's a good way to look at it. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3489.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like imagine if the fire department could deny you [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3490.3199999999997s)]
*  when your house was burning. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3492.24s)]
*  The problem is they're already making so much money [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3493.62s)]
*  doing it the way they're doing it now, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3496.04s)]
*  and they've got a really good system. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3497.52s)]
*  If I was a business person involved in that system, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3499.66s)]
*  not just a human being with ethics and morals, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3501.58s)]
*  I would say this is the way to do it [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3504.5s)]
*  because this is the way we're gonna make the most money. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3505.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3508.74s)]
*  But people are tired of it. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3509.74s)]
*  That's why people were cheering when that guy got shot, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3511.54s)]
*  which is kind of fucked up. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3513.86s)]
*  Here's the truth of the matter. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3515.34s)]
*  Some shit just can't be for profit. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3516.26s)]
*  If we want it to be for the best, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3517.98s)]
*  some stuff can't be for profit. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3521.26s)]
*  The thing about that guy shooting that person [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3523.18s)]
*  that's the most disturbing wasn't just that a lot of people [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3525.46s)]
*  cheered for it, but the most disturbing [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3528.26s)]
*  was that people weren't mad. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3531.28s)]
*  They weren't outraged. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3533.2000000000003s)]
*  They didn't treat it like a regular assassination. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3534.0400000000004s)]
*  It was like an assassination where he deserved it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3536.2000000000003s)]
*  It didn't seem like a bad, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3539.5600000000004s)]
*  even though people were like, that was horrible, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3540.88s)]
*  it didn't seem like as bad a thing [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3543.1600000000003s)]
*  as if someone shot John Lennon. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3545.5600000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3547.1600000000003s)]
*  Not even a famous person. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3548.2000000000003s)]
*  If someone just randomly shot some executive [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3549.6000000000004s)]
*  as he was walking out. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3553.82s)]
*  You know how I reacted? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3555.1600000000003s)]
*  The same way when they got Osama Bin Laden. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3556.42s)]
*  I was like, it's the same to me. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3559.2200000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3561.28s)]
*  Yeah, because think about it. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3562.26s)]
*  You feel like that insurance guy was Osama Bin Laden? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3563.98s)]
*  No, but I mean, they both are indirectly responsible [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3565.98s)]
*  for the death of how many Americans, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3570.82s)]
*  except he was doing it for profit. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3574.34s)]
*  Osama was doing it for the love of the game or whatever. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3575.78s)]
*  I do think it's a corporate capture issue, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3578.5s)]
*  because I think the culture of the corporation [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3580.94s)]
*  is to make as much money as possible [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3583.7200000000003s)]
*  and deny more people than the other insurance companies do. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3585.68s)]
*  Like they had a higher rate of denying. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3588.8799999999997s)]
*  But you can't let people's grandmas die [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3591.96s)]
*  and let them stay in pain and shit [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3593.8799999999997s)]
*  and expect them to have empathy for you. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3595.48s)]
*  Did you ever see that one video? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3597.12s)]
*  I think we played it on the podcast [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3598.16s)]
*  where this woman talked about how she made a decision [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3599.44s)]
*  to deny someone care that they definitely needed, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3604.46s)]
*  and she was thanked by the company, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3607.3799999999997s)]
*  and then the guy wound up dying, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3610.3399999999997s)]
*  and she knows that she could have given him [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3611.7999999999997s)]
*  the lifesaving care. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3614.2s)]
*  She could have approved it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3615.9s)]
*  And she was rewarded for not approving it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3616.7400000000002s)]
*  They were like, you did the right thing. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3619.1400000000003s)]
*  So that's like the culture is not about, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3620.7000000000003s)]
*  see what we were talking about earlier. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3623.82s)]
*  It's not really about healthcare. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3625.46s)]
*  Healthcare is the arena in which they're playing their game, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3626.86s)]
*  but the real game is the people behind the scenes [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3630.42s)]
*  that are trying to make money. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3632.94s)]
*  And especially if you're doing something that is not, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3634.1400000000003s)]
*  you don't have a lot of, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3636.98s)]
*  it doesn't give you a lot of meaning [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3638.02s)]
*  to deny people healthcare. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3639.6600000000003s)]
*  It doesn't give you a lot of meaning. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3641.42s)]
*  You don't feel like you have a meaningful life. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3643.44s)]
*  So those people guarantee you, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3645.52s)]
*  they get addicted to material stuff. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3648.28s)]
*  They get addicted to getting a nice Rolex. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3650.96s)]

*  Yep, yep. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3661.52s)]
*  And you gotta somehow or another placate yourself, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3662.36s)]
*  whether it's with drugs or with buying a new purse, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3664.44s)]

*  if you're living like that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3672.98s)]
*  You're not gonna be interested in starting your own fire [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3674.26s)]
*  and reading books by candlelight. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3676.86s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3678.32s)]

*  And you're surrounded by people that like, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3682.2200000000003s)]
*  they're impressed by the shit you're doing too. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3685.58s)]
*  And they probably all medicate. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3687.66s)]
*  Everybody's on probably something [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3689.1800000000003s)]
*  that's like, it allows them to like, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3690.94s)]
*  not freak out all the time. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3693.3s)]
*  Some sort of anti-anxiety medication [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3695.14s)]
*  because of what they're doing. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3697.02s)]

*  You don't feel like it's a good relationship between you [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3701.5s)]

*  Only they feel bad. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3712.98s)]
*  I think they're medicated. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3714.14s)]
*  I bet, yeah, I bet if you're in, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3715.66s)]
*  I bet you have anxiety when you're doing stuff like that [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3717.3s)]
*  and you probably need an SSRI. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3719.3s)]
*  Probably need a little something. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3721.1s)]
*  But it's like, the easiest person to lie to is yourself. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3722.86s)]
*  So it's like, you probably feel like shit. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3725.5s)]
*  You get that first paycheck and you go, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3726.78s)]
*  you start twisting shit so you can justify it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3728.38s)]
*  Somebody would do this. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3731.2400000000002s)]
*  And you also realize, hey, the rest of the public, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3732.44s)]
*  they don't know. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3734.92s)]
*  They don't know, that's just the insurance business. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3735.76s)]
*  That's the business. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3737.6400000000003s)]
*  This is standard. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3740.44s)]
*  Standard's a word they use a lot [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3742.0s)]
*  when they're trying to fuck you. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3743.2400000000002s)]
*  People looked at it very differently [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3744.4s)]
*  than someone just shooting some other person. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3745.92s)]
*  They almost looked at it like he deserved it. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3748.76s)]
*  And it wasn't bipartisan, that's what I mean. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3750.8s)]
*  That was the wildest thing about the whole thing. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3752.84s)]
*  It was like, you couldn't tell [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3755.36s)]
*  by any other information from anybody [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3757.08s)]
*  how they felt about it. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3760.14s)]
*  I just felt nothing, honestly. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3761.14s)]
*  It was weird too, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3762.22s)]
*  because it gave a lot of liberal grifters [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3763.1s)]
*  the opportunity to celebrate someone getting shot [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3765.74s)]
*  and murdered violently. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3769.22s)]
*  Which is like, should be the complete opposite [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3771.3399999999997s)]
*  of the way they view violent crime. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3776.7s)]
*  They should think of violence as being the last resort. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3778.9399999999996s)]
*  Violence is abhorrent. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3782.02s)]
*  Violence is not a part of a civilized society. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3783.62s)]
*  We want kindness and compassion [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3786.06s)]
*  and we want people to be able to live their life health. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3787.94s)]
*  You don't want violent murders on the street [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3790.96s)]
*  if you are a progressive. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3794.04s)]
*  But a lot of progressives were cheering [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3795.62s)]
*  when this guy got murdered. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3798.7400000000002s)]
*  Which just shows how many grifters and hypocrites there are. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3800.8s)]
*  The thing is, I would, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3803.12s)]
*  because for me, it just depends on who got murdered. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3804.52s)]
*  I'm not rooting for a murderer. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3807.84s)]
*  But if certain people die, I'm like, well, you know. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3810.0s)]
*  Well, I don't even know what this guy's relationship [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3812.92s)]
*  to that guy was. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3815.88s)]
*  I don't know why he wanted to kill him specifically. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3817.54s)]
*  In the end, it says specifically, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3820.22s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of speculation [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3821.06s)]
*  about was it a family member [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3823.22s)]
*  or like he'd had a back surgery that screwed him up. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3824.98s)]
*  But like I said, I only get the news that rises, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3828.66s)]
*  that's like forced in my face. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3832.84s)]
*  Cause I don't watch any of the channels. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3833.94s)]
*  To me, it's different than like, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3836.1s)]
*  let's say some Iraq war veteran assassinated Dick Cheney. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3838.48s)]
*  Like that to me makes more sense. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3844.26s)]
*  That one makes more sense. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3848.7s)]
*  Like here's a guy who knows that this guy [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3850.26s)]
*  engineered this thing where they lied [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3852.78s)]
*  about weapons of mass destruction, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3855.9s)]
*  led us into a war that ultimately wind up killing [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3857.54s)]
*  who knows how many people. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3859.94s)]
*  But I think Dick Cheney would have got a better reaction [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3861.14s)]
*  than this guy. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3866.14s)]
*  You think people would have been sad [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3867.22s)]
*  that Dick Cheney got shot? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3868.62s)]
*  Well, they would have thought it's very dangerous. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3869.94s)]
*  Well, they would have thought it's very dangerous [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3871.7999999999997s)]
*  cause whenever a vice president gets shot, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3873.2s)]
*  everybody feels vulnerable. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3875.04s)]
*  I think that's something that you can partisanize. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3875.88s)]
*  Partisanize a word? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3878.96s)]
*  I think it's something you can make partisan. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3880.16s)]
*  But like I said, that's what's special. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3883.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what's special about this is- [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3886.0s)]
*  Everybody got fucked over by a traitor. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3887.2599999999998s)]
*  Everybody got fucked over. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3888.52s)]
*  So like there's people that love Dick Cheney [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3889.36s)]
*  or there's people that still hold [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3891.08s)]
*  like those politics from back then. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3892.44s)]
*  I don't know if anybody loved Dick Cheney. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3893.92s)]
*  That's why it was really crazy [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3896.08s)]
*  when Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3897.2s)]
*  and they were all like, yeah. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3898.72s)]
*  What are you talking? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3899.9s)]
*  What? That guy? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3900.74s)]
*  What? You forgot? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3901.66s)]
*  Yeah, but I just mean, I don't think he is as hated as, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3903.54s)]
*  I mean, the truth is nobody knew that CEO's name before this [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3909.1s)]
*  but the whole business is hated. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3913.9s)]
*  So it's like he became the face of that. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3916.38s)]
*  And it's definitely apolitical. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3918.88s)]
*  It's like, I don't know a single person [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3922.38s)]
*  that hasn't had an issue with health insurance. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3926.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3929.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, again, it's a business. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3931.18s)]
*  It's a business designed to make money [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3933.2599999999998s)]
*  and all of them want to make, I mean, they have an obligation. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3934.98s)]
*  They need to make more money next quarter. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3937.7799999999997s)]
*  What can we do? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3939.7799999999997s)]
*  What can we do? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3940.7799999999997s)]
*  They start denying people. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3941.62s)]
*  And if you're using AI, like specifically to deny people, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3943.14s)]
*  like let's make this more efficient. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3947.18s)]
*  Is that what's happening now? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3949.34s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, but I've read it. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3950.82s)]
*  I've read it that some insurance companies are using AI [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3952.5s)]
*  to deny more claims than ever. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3954.86s)]
*  See if that's true. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3956.74s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3958.52s)]
*  Would you be shocked if you're a company [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3959.8399999999997s)]
*  and you're trying to make the most money [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3961.72s)]
*  and you find out that there's software [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3963.12s)]
*  that'll allow you to make more money [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3964.4399999999996s)]
*  and all you care about is making money, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3965.8399999999997s)]
*  you're not really caring about healthcare. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3967.68s)]
*  You don't want people to feel, if you did, you'd say, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3969.16s)]
*  we should all make less money [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  and give out more money to these people. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3972.68s)]
*  We could accept more claims [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3974.5s)]
*  and we would have a much healthier world [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3977.3999999999996s)]
*  and we would feel better karmically, right? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3979.9599999999996s)]
*  Wouldn't that be nice if they thought like that? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3982.2s)]
*  No. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3984.3999999999996s)]
*  You'd have to own the company. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3985.7599999999998s)]
*  You'd have to be like a guru, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3986.94s)]
*  like a really calm, peaceful guru, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3988.46s)]
*  and you would own the company [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3990.14s)]
*  and just have an ethical insurance company [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3991.3s)]
*  and not give anybody's stake in it. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3992.94s)]
*  Don't let anybody try to juice the system [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3995.1s)]
*  because they want to make more money. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3998.06s)]
*  Oh, like not a public company. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=3998.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4001.54s)]
*  Stay private. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4002.38s)]
*  Stay private. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4003.38s)]
*  Don't you think the type of person [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4004.2200000000003s)]
*  that would even want to make an insurance company, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4005.38s)]
*  I think you would have to be a certain type. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4008.42s)]
*  Yeah, you have to be a cycle. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4010.78s)]
*  I should profit from suffering somehow. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4011.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, well, you're gambling, right? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4013.98s)]
*  You're gambling that something doesn't happen to you [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4015.96s)]
*  that's more expensive than all the payments [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4018.08s)]
*  you give me every month for 10 years. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4019.7200000000003s)]
*  Because I think if you start heading in that direction [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4021.28s)]
*  of like ethical health care, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4023.32s)]
*  eventually you're gonna arrive at it, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4025.2400000000002s)]
*  oh, there shouldn't be health insurance. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4026.56s)]
*  It should just cost what it costs. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4028.96s)]
*  Well, it should probably be the same way [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4030.44s)]
*  we treat the fire department. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4032.28s)]
*  But if we're gonna do that and people say, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4034.04s)]
*  what about all these people that are obese? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4035.52s)]
*  What about all these people that are eating bad food? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4037.16s)]
*  Yeah, we gotta educate our society. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4039.36s)]
*  We have to think of ourselves as a community, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4041.36s)]
*  as a collective community, educate ourselves, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4043.3s)]
*  and health care should be something [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4046.42s)]
*  that's paid for by the government. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4048.34s)]
*  Insurance companies use artificial intelligence [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4050.38s)]
*  to automatically deny claims, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4052.46s)]
*  which you can raise concerns about bias and inaccuracies, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4054.2200000000003s)]
*  which can raise concerns about bias and inaccuracies. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4057.3s)]
*  If your claim is denied by AI, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4060.4s)]
*  you can take steps to understand your rights [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4062.0600000000004s)]
*  and challenge the denial. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4063.94s)]
*  Keep records, document all correspondence with your insurer, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4066.26s)]
*  including denial letters and any communication about AI. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4069.38s)]
*  Lawyer can help you understand your rights [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4073.26s)]
*  and determine if the denial was made in bad faith. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4074.88s)]
*  Like, you're fucked. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4077.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, for most people, especially people that work all day [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4079.32s)]
*  and you're dealing with this shit, you're fucked. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4081.96s)]
*  I think this is in California. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4084.28s)]
*  Landmark law prohibits health insurance companies [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4086.1000000000004s)]
*  from using AI to deny health care coverage. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4088.5200000000004s)]
*  All right, that's great. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4091.0s)]
*  Especially like using it specifically to deny. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4092.96s)]
*  So that's California, that's a great law. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4095.36s)]
*  The whole country should adopt that. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4097.400000000001s)]
*  Using AI to deny. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4098.52s)]
*  Yeah, I really think that the problem is [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4099.96s)]
*  that there's been a long history of profit for health care [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4102.44s)]
*  and that they go into it to profit. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4106.94s)]
*  And the real problem with that is, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4108.98s)]
*  but you also want the best surgeons, right? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4113.419999999999s)]
*  You want the best doctors and they have to be motivated. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4116.259999999999s)]
*  And most of them are motivated both [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4118.66s)]
*  by excelling in their practice [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4121.299999999999s)]
*  and also by material possessions that reward them. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4123.74s)]
*  Like doctors always have like a Porsche, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4127.339999999999s)]
*  doctors have a Mercedes, doctors have a nice house. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4129.32s)]
*  You should be a doctor, Brian. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4132.04s)]
*  You should be a doctor, a nice doctor. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4134.04s)]
*  Doctors make a lot of money. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4135.719999999999s)]
*  But they also have a fuckload of bills [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4136.879999999999s)]
*  and they have a fuckload of insurance, okay? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4138.839999999999s)]
*  So they have, the problem with them [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4141.0s)]
*  is like liability insurance. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4143.82s)]
*  Like liability insurance for malpractice insurance [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4145.82s)]
*  for doctors is crazy expensive. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4148.48s)]
*  But don't doctors still make good money in countries? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4151.5599999999995s)]
*  They do, but they're constantly moving people [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4153.759999999999s)]
*  in and out of their office because they got a fucking [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4156.259999999999s)]
*  heavy nut to cover every month. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4158.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, UnitedHealth is facing multiple class action lawsuits [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4160.820000000001s)]
*  over its use of algorithms. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4164.58s)]
*  Its investment practices and its treatment of patients, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4166.7s)]
*  algorithm use, claim processing. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4169.900000000001s)]
*  UnitedHealth is facing a class action lawsuit [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4171.7s)]
*  over the algorithm it uses to process claims. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4174.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4177.58s)]
*  And then a big lawsuit about health. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4178.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, monsters, monsters. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4179.820000000001s)]
*  But this is also because we've set up a system of profit. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4182.42s)]
*  Now imagine if that system of profit existed [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4185.7s)]
*  for the fire department. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4187.78s)]
*  Imagine if you had to pay fire department fees every month [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4189.04s)]
*  and if you didn't and your house burned, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4192.48s)]
*  they go, hey Brian, we just checked [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4194.0s)]
*  and you don't have fire coverage. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4195.28s)]
*  And so now you're fucked. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4197.2s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4198.5199999999995s)]
*  That's crazy, right? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4200.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I haven't seen it happen. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4201.799999999999s)]
*  So we agree that the fire department should be [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4203.799999999999s)]
*  kind of a socialist organization. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4206.48s)]
*  Okay, why not healthcare? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4208.719999999999s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4211.24s)]
*  But then the problem is, you know, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4212.16s)]
*  Dr. Fucking Grossman, he wants a Ferrari. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4214.24s)]
*  The baddest motherfucker for fixing knees. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4218.42s)]
*  He fixes everybody's knees on the Lakers. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4220.66s)]
*  He wants some money. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4222.94s)]
*  Give him a Ferrari. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4223.78s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4224.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem with that is like, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4225.9s)]
*  how do you pay, how do you, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4227.62s)]
*  like how much does everybody get paid? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4229.339999999999s)]
*  Does the government just pay everybody [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4231.5s)]
*  the same way they're getting paid now? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4233.66s)]
*  Or does it become like a government job, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4235.58s)]
*  like you know, like you're a state appointed defense attorney. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4238.46s)]
*  It becomes like the NFL. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4243.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4244.339999999999s)]
*  Like not as motivated as some like super high powered [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4245.179999999999s)]
*  defense attorney that you know, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4247.98s)]
*  handles huge cases and knows the law inside. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4249.719999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4251.959999999999s)]
*  It's like who's gonna fix you now? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4253.759999999999s)]
*  Because like my friends in Canada, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4255.32s)]
*  they say yeah, healthcare is free. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4256.919999999999s)]
*  But like one of my friends, she had to wait, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4258.16s)]
*  my friend Jen, she had to wait like a year plus [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4260.44s)]

*  she's waiting like a whole year to get her knee fixed. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4268.679999999999s)]
*  I'm pretty sure, I hope I'm not speaking out of school. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4271.58s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it was close to a year. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4273.5s)]
*  And so she's got a bad knee for a year. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4275.8s)]
*  Whereas like in America, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4278.28s)]
*  you're supposed to be able to go to the doctor. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4279.5199999999995s)]

*  Like that's the shitty part. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4313.14s)]

*  Like a giant percentage of those people [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4333.160000000001s)]
*  that lost their homes in that fire, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4335.64s)]

*  You need to see it, cause it's so creepy. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4380.42s)]
*  I think it was arson. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4381.32s)]
*  I think somebody did it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4382.66s)]
*  Whether it was a schizophrenic person, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4384.0599999999995s)]
*  that a fire bug. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4385.78s)]
*  There's a lot of those people that are fire bugs, man. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4387.46s)]
*  There's people that are like actual arsonists [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4389.339999999999s)]
*  and when you get into the conditions [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4393.0599999999995s)]
*  that happened in the Santa Ana winds when California's dry. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4395.34s)]
*  You remember when it was. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4398.0199999999995s)]
*  You were there in 2018 with that big crazy fire, right? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4399.219999999999s)]
*  Did you see any of that on the 405? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4401.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4403.94s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4404.78s)]
*  Yeah, and I remember there being a big one [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4405.7s)]
*  probably like 2007 to 2008. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4409.46s)]
*  The thing is, it doesn't have to be some crazy conspiracy. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4412.42s)]
*  People think it's a conspiracy, a land grab, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4415.66s)]
*  this whole thing. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4417.54s)]
*  Maybe, maybe, but also, people start fires. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4418.38s)]
*  It's a known crime. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4421.88s)]
*  In fact, one of the people that they arrested, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4423.64s)]
*  he had a fake fire truck. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4425.92s)]
*  So this dude was a known arsonist, I believe from Oregon. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4428.12s)]
*  He bought a fire truck with a fireman's outfit [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4432.44s)]
*  and was going into these areas. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4436.74s)]
*  That's actually hilarious. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4439.92s)]
*  And he's an arsonist. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4441.04s)]
*  Like a known arsonist. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4442.84s)]
*  So he's probably starting fires. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4443.68s)]
*  Yeah, arsonist with a fire truck. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4445.12s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4446.48s)]
*  But some people are just out of their fucking minds, man. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4447.32s)]
*  Including a lot of firemen. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4450.820000000001s)]
*  That's a problem with firemen. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4452.66s)]
*  There's been firemen who have started fires. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4454.22s)]
*  But it's wild that you, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4457.38s)]
*  I feel like if you go to prison for arson, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4459.74s)]
*  you purposely burnish it. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4462.34s)]
*  If they let you out, they should at least track you [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4463.860000000001s)]
*  like they track pitos. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4465.62s)]
*  Well, you've killed a lot of people. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4466.9800000000005s)]
*  If a human being was caught [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4469.06s)]
*  that definitely lit these three fires [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4472.46s)]
*  that appear simultaneously, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4474.820000000001s)]
*  if a human being did that, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4476.46s)]
*  they're responsible for I don't know how many deaths. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4477.42s)]
*  How many people died? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4479.56s)]
*  I think it's 25 or something like that. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4481.139999999999s)]
*  25 burned alive. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4482.66s)]
*  How much damage? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4484.74s)]
*  How many people are going to die later? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4485.58s)]
*  Sure, like you're in jail for the rest of your life [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4487.0599999999995s)]

*  You're in jail for the rest of your life. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4490.62s)]
*  You owe $350 billion and counting. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4491.7s)]
*  It's $350 billion of damage. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4497.379999999999s)]
*  And then Alta Dina is gone. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4501.299999999999s)]

*  but this is from 2024's fires. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4603.38s)]
*  These are fires are in a different spot [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4606.1s)]
*  than the ones that just happened. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4607.94s)]
*  So I don't know if that's the one. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4609.76s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4612.5199999999995s)]
*  This is the caption from the... [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4613.78s)]
*  So it's miscaptioned. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4615.7s)]
*  So it's not true. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4616.94s)]
*  What about the one where it shows a person starting the fire? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4617.94s)]
*  Because there is one video where they think [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4621.06s)]
*  that they have an image, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4623.26s)]
*  an actual image of a guy starting the fire. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4624.96s)]
*  I think it was a person near it, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4627.28s)]
*  but I'll double check. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4628.5599999999995s)]
*  Whoops, just happened to be near it with a blowtorch. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4630.0s)]
*  How about that guy? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4631.879999999999s)]
*  They caught that one guy and he's like, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4632.719999999999s)]
*  I was just lighting my joint. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4634.759999999999s)]
*  He had a blowtorch in his hand [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4636.12s)]
*  and they made like a citizen's arrest. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4637.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but he might have been telling the truth. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4640.919999999999s)]
*  Nope, dude had been arrested like eight times. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4642.28s)]
*  He had vandalism, all kinds of shit on his resume, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4644.44s)]
*  violent crimes, I believe. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4647.96s)]
*  That don't mean he was lying. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4649.919999999999s)]
*  Well, he was running around in a fire with a blowtorch. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4651.08s)]
*  Hey bro, put that down. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4654.02s)]
*  Yeah, but how you gonna light your shit? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4655.7s)]
*  A lighter? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4657.94s)]
*  He said he couldn't afford a lighter. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4659.34s)]
*  Bitch, a lighter is a quarter. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4662.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4663.9s)]
*  I mean, it's wild to just carry a blowtorch around. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4664.74s)]
*  How much is a lighter? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4666.54s)]
*  How much is one of them little Bic lighters? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4667.38s)]
*  A dollar? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4669.12s)]
*  Is that a dollar? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4669.96s)]
*  Yeah, like a dollar. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4670.78s)]
*  Maybe it's probably a dollar 20 something. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4671.62s)]
*  See, if it's made in America, it's gonna cost more. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4672.86s)]
*  All right? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4675.62s)]
*  Otherwise China's gonna chop off our fucking supply of Bics. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4676.9s)]
*  Who makes Bics? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4681.3s)]
*  Am I guessing? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4682.7s)]
*  See, in my head, I was thinking like, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4684.04s)]
*  you in the house, you can't find a lighter. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4685.88s)]
*  So you're like, I got a torch, I'm gonna use that. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4687.88s)]
*  I would run around on the streets. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4689.48s)]
*  But you're saying he was like walking around outside. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4690.32s)]
*  He found him out where the fires were, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4692.12s)]
*  with a blowtorch, and he said it was empty. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4693.92s)]
*  He said, Google, it's empty. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4696.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like, even if you're telling the truth, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4697.22s)]
*  like your stupid ass deserve just the inconvenience. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4698.56s)]
*  Yeah, he was a criminal. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4702.06s)]
*  What was I just gonna ask you to Google? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4705.26s)]
*  I'm trying to find a picture of the satellite [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4707.16s)]
*  of a person near the fire when it started, but. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4709.16s)]
*  Huberman filmed people starting fires. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4713.74s)]
*  Andrew Huberman, he was driving down the street [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4716.48s)]
*  and he caught these guys starting a fire [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4718.98s)]
*  and filmed it, put it on his phone. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4721.14s)]
*  So people are starting fires here. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4722.88s)]
*  Because you got all these homeless people and crazy people [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4724.64s)]
*  and people that wanna burn it all down, man. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4726.82s)]
*  And while the fire is going on, they feel like, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4729.76s)]
*  fuck it, man, let's help this fucking fire. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4731.66s)]
*  Fuck these rich people. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4734.62s)]
*  I mean, it's the Palisades. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4736.0199999999995s)]
*  They're like the richest people in all of LA. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4737.32s)]
*  You think that's their motivations? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4741.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of that for the arsonists. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4744.36s)]
*  I think a lot of it is like fuck society, my life sucks. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4745.839999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people just, there's crazy people [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4748.799999999999s)]
*  like the guy from Oregon that are almost like [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4750.78s)]
*  amateur firefighters, amateur arsonists. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4753.379999999999s)]
*  That's their side project. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4757.839999999999s)]
*  Did you see Chappelle talk about it on his SNL monologue? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4759.379999999999s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4761.379999999999s)]
*  Man, it's the best one ever. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4762.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4763.96s)]
*  Easy. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4764.78s)]
*  I know, I need to sit down and watch it. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4766.16s)]
*  Everybody tells me it's awesome. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4767.419999999999s)]
*  It's the best monologue I've ever seen, on SNL. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4768.759999999999s)]
*  Well, he talks about Palestine, he compares Palestine to? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4771.94s)]
*  Yeah, he pretty much went through all the major things [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4774.82s)]
*  that's going on. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4778.48s)]
*  The Palestine thing is nuts. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4780.46s)]
*  I watched a video yesterday of Gaza, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4781.719999999999s)]
*  and I don't know if you've seen like flyover drone footage [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4783.66s)]
*  of what it looks like now. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4786.36s)]
*  Nope. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4788.099999999999s)]
*  You wanna see it? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4789.5s)]
*  Yeah, let's see it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4790.339999999999s)]

*  but I just don't actively go seek it out. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4803.0s)]
*  This is so depressing. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4804.78s)]
*  If it's something I need to know, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4806.139999999999s)]

*  There's a lot of before and after videos [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4810.139999999999s)]
*  where they'll show someone driving down a road before, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4812.679999999999s)]
*  and then they show what it all looks like now. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4815.379999999999s)]
*  It's like the city doesn't exist anymore. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4817.719999999999s)]
*  It's like if, way bigger than downtown Austin, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4820.32s)]
*  wiped off the map. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4824.12s)]

*  as far as the eye can see, just destruction. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4845.860000000001s)]
*  Everything's got a missile hole in it. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4849.06s)]
*  Everything's collapsed, everything's fucked up. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4851.3s)]
*  Every now and then, one house, [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4853.06s)]
*  or one building in between is untouched. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4854.56s)]
*  But most of it is fucking destroyed. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4856.74s)]
*  If I was the guy who lived next door [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4858.88s)]

*  And then somehow I know this is acceptable [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4879.98s)]
*  to get rid of Hamas, to just completely annihilate everybody. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4881.72s)]
*  I mean, the number of people that are dead now [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4885.2s)]

*  And it's happening right now. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4895.4s)]
*  This is how it used to look? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4897.72s)]
*  Uh-huh, this is what it used to look like. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4899.4s)]
*  Look at that, shops and cars. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4902.099999999999s)]
*  And now it's just destroyed. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4905.16s)]
*  Everything destroyed. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4908.44s)]
*  They bombed the fuck out of everything. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4909.54s)]
*  Boy, this shit make you feel something. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4911.44s)]
*  Well, this is like, this is never coming back. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4913.28s)]
*  Like, this is like, they essentially moved everybody [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4916.679999999999s)]
*  out of there. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4920.38s)]
*  Like, who's gonna stay there now? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4921.5599999999995s)]
*  What is all of this shit? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4923.32s)]
*  What is all of the, what is that? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4924.4s)]
*  What is all of? Tents. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4927.04s)]
*  Oh, wow. Tents where people have to stay in tents. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4928.679999999999s)]
*  And by the way, they might bomb those tents too. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4930.92s)]
*  The whole thing's very scary, dude, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4933.46s)]
*  because it's just at a level of destruction [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4935.12s)]
*  that's impossible to say that you support it. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4939.84s)]
*  It's like, this is insane. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4943.360000000001s)]
*  These are human lives. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4944.6s)]
*  Like, how many people are dying here? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4945.6s)]
*  Is this the only way to do this? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4947.76s)]
*  Is this the only way to do this? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4949.68s)]
*  This seems crazy. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4951.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4954.0s)]
*  And how did you guys get to this point? [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4954.84s)]
*  Damn, see man, see, you know, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4957.4400000000005s)]
*  this is why I avoid the news. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4959.4400000000005s)]
*  It's because all the happiest, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4961.4800000000005s)]
*  all the stupidest people I know are happy as shit. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4962.84s)]
*  So I'm like, I just need to know less. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4966.02s)]
*  No, you need to know. And I can enjoy. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4968.24s)]
*  I think there's something to that, [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4970.12s)]
*  but I think we kind of need to pay attention nowadays. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4971.92s)]
*  I think things are getting real weird, real weird. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4976.08s)]
*  Because you know what it is? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4979.4s)]
*  It's the death of truth. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4980.24s)]
*  Like, it's hard to know what's true. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4981.36s)]
*  You hear something, it sound true, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4982.76s)]
*  and then you hear something else, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4984.44s)]
*  you go, that's not true. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4985.48s)]
*  And then both can point to the links and studies, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4986.599999999999s)]
*  and you're like, I... [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4990.28s)]
*  It's just stressful trying to figure out [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4993.0s)]
*  what's correct and what isn't. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4994.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's on purpose. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4995.36s)]
*  I know. That's on purpose. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4996.8s)]
*  They're doing a real good job of confusing people. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=4999.16s)]
*  That's when I, you know... [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5002.48s)]
*  And everybody thinks they're right. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5003.96s)]
*  Everybody thinks they're right, yeah. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5005.36s)]
*  And there's also a lot of stuff [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5006.5599999999995s)]
*  that's going on behind the scenes. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5009.48s)]
*  Like a lot of the way stories are amplified [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5010.84s)]
*  is to serve as a distraction from other things [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5013.76s)]
*  that are taking place at the same time. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5016.24s)]
*  Like they love to do stuff like that, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5018.24s)]
*  where they'll push out a story, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5020.2s)]
*  like some inflammatory story. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5022.2s)]
*  That really the design of that story [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5023.92s)]
*  is to get you distracted from other things [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5025.68s)]
*  that are going on simultaneously. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5028.68s)]
*  That's what I think a lot of this, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5030.92s)]
*  when I think about the UFO stuff, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5032.320000000001s)]
*  I'm always like, man, this... [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5034.04s)]
*  If I wanted something to distract the shit out of people, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5036.200000000001s)]
*  this is a really good one. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5038.72s)]
*  Not saying that that's what they're doing, but it makes me... [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5040.400000000001s)]
*  Did you see the signs I discovered yesterday? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5042.72s)]
*  No, you were about to tell me at the beginning. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5044.04s)]
*  They fucking, they had a... [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5045.68s)]
*  They found an asteroid. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5048.76s)]
*  Oh, I did see that. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5051.6s)]
*  And it had like most of the ingredients for life on it. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5052.64s)]
*  All the amino acids, not all of them, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5056.68s)]
*  but like all but three, and then all of... [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5058.72s)]
*  I forget what the big ass word this lady used. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5062.280000000001s)]
*  But I think this was a theory before, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5064.8s)]
*  but it's becoming more and more likely [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5068.04s)]
*  that life was seeded by... [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5069.96s)]
*  Asteroid in bags. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5072.72s)]
*  An asteroid or something. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5073.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's a theory called panspermia. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5074.400000000001s)]
*  Panspermia. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5077.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5078.64s)]
*  And it also accounts for some things [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5079.8s)]
*  that don't fit in, like psilocybin mushrooms. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5083.2s)]
*  There's something very alien about them [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5087.32s)]
*  that one of the things about spores [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5089.679999999999s)]
*  is that spores can survive like almost anything. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5092.04s)]
*  They can survive in a vacuum. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5094.96s)]
*  They can survive through space. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5096.4s)]
*  Spores are insanely durable. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5098.36s)]
*  And if you have the potential for all of these amino acids [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5100.4s)]
*  and different minerals, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5105.08s)]
*  and there was absolutely salt on that, right? [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5106.48s)]
*  Wasn't there salt on that rock as well? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5109.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5113.08s)]
*  Let me see. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5113.92s)]
*  I think there was a bunch of different elements of life [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5114.74s)]
*  on that asteroid. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5117.24s)]
*  And why not spores? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5119.0s)]
*  And if some mushroom that grows on another planet [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5121.599999999999s)]
*  where these human beings interact with nature through it, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5129.0599999999995s)]
*  then it just lands here on Earth. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5131.719999999999s)]
*  Did you find it? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5135.12s)]
*  Osiris-REx mission. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5135.96s)]
*  So they found amino acids, nucleotide bases, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5138.5199999999995s)]
*  minerals from salt water, and more. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5141.72s)]
*  So that means it has all the building blocks of life [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5146.8s)]
*  and it comes from salt water. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5149.92s)]
*  And a chunk of it comes flying off. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5151.8s)]
*  Isn't that nutty? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5154.0s)]
*  That's how a lot of things, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5155.12s)]
*  they think that's maybe how the water got here. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5156.240000000001s)]
*  That's one of the theories. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5159.42s)]
*  An African asteroid. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5160.26s)]
*  Yeah, like comets. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5161.16s)]
*  A comet, yeah. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5162.280000000001s)]
*  That comets hit us and that's where we got the water. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5163.12s)]
*  Is that a real theory still? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5165.400000000001s)]
*  Because they changed those. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5167.04s)]
*  They look at them and they go, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5169.200000000001s)]
*  well, maybe. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5170.2s)]
*  Like now they're wondering whether dark energy is real. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5173.0s)]
*  They think maybe time moves differently [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5176.28s)]
*  in between galaxies. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5178.48s)]
*  Like they've got some new theory. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5181.04s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard Neil deGrasse Tyson [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5182.6s)]
*  talk about that recently. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5185.72s)]
*  All of it is like, what are you even saying? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5187.24s)]
*  Or that gravity is different in different places? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5189.76s)]
*  Something like that? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5192.84s)]
*  They think that gravity and space-time moves differently [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5193.68s)]
*  in the voids in between galaxies and planets. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5198.76s)]
*  Wait a minute, who's saying that? [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5203.6s)]
*  Who's saying that? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5204.64s)]
*  Like what are you saying? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5205.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5206.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5207.240000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, bro. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5208.08s)]
*  Are they thinking that's what it counts for the- [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5209.400000000001s)]
*  I just need to know less because it's breaking my brain. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5211.240000000001s)]
*  That's why they're apart from each other. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5214.6s)]
*  It's not that dark energy is pushing them away [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5216.240000000001s)]
*  from each other. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5218.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5219.6s)]
*  Like this is the theory of dark matter and dark energy. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5220.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like 90 something percent of the universe [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5223.320000000001s)]
*  is this theory. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5225.320000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5226.92s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5227.76s)]
*  If it's not that, then is 90% of the universe what? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5229.42s)]
*  It's like just space-time moving in a different way? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5231.42s)]
*  Like what happened? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5233.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean science has been kind of killing it. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5235.54s)]
*  Well, they've got some new tools now [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5238.14s)]
*  like that James Webb telescope. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5240.26s)]
*  That thing's crazy. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5241.86s)]
*  Remember when I first told you about it hadn't launched yet [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5243.62s)]
*  and I was like, that's gonna change everything. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5245.34s)]
*  Well, I remember Duncan told me something about it [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5246.66s)]
*  a long time ago. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5248.82s)]
*  He said they found something that they think [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5250.54s)]
*  is at least 22 billion years old. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5253.98s)]
*  They found some star cluster or something [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5257.5s)]
*  that they think is 22 billion years old. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5260.98s)]
*  So it throws the whole Big Bang thing. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5262.54s)]
*  Is he talking about the Methuselah star? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5264.78s)]
*  No, that's interesting too. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5266.66s)]
*  Cause the Methuselah star is actually older somehow [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5268.14s)]
*  than the entire universe, which doesn't make any sense. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5271.32s)]
*  It's like 14 plus billion years old. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5273.98s)]
*  So it's like a little bit older [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5276.1s)]
*  than what they think was the Big Bang. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5277.18s)]
*  But then didn't somebody recently, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5278.66s)]
*  or not recently, but didn't someone say that like [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5280.42s)]
*  it's still within the margin of error? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5283.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's still within the margin. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5286.02s)]
*  So it's not as if it's the Methuselah star is. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5288.22s)]
*  But not this new discovery. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5290.06s)]
*  So the new discovery for the James Webb telescope [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5291.820000000001s)]
*  is they found galaxies that formed too quickly. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5293.74s)]
*  And they formed so long ago, like so far away [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5298.74s)]
*  because they could see bigger now, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5303.74s)]
*  that it's changing, there's two things possible. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5305.7s)]
*  Maybe we were wrong about how quickly galaxies form. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5308.820000000001s)]
*  Maybe they form way quicker or maybe the universe [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5311.9400000000005s)]
*  is way older than we think it is. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5315.02s)]
*  But these things exist and then you could find them. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5317.38s)]
*  And then although there's things that like blink in [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5319.38s)]
*  and that they exist at one point in time [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5321.78s)]
*  and don't exist anymore, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5323.62s)]
*  they don't know what the fuck those are. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5324.66s)]
*  These red lights, these red spots [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5325.82s)]
*  that they found in the universe. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5328.34s)]
*  But they think that people are very reluctant to commit, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5330.179999999999s)]
*  cause they don't really know. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5335.259999999999s)]
*  But the potential is that the universe is not 14 [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5336.099999999999s)]
*  or 13 point whatever billion years old, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5339.54s)]
*  but maybe as old as 24 billion years old. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5341.38s)]
*  Or maybe in there. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5344.98s)]
*  The next time you come over here, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5346.139999999999s)]
*  I wanna be here the next time you have one of these, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5347.66s)]
*  Lawrence Krauss. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5350.379999999999s)]
*  You wanna be in here with that? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5351.5s)]
*  Michio Kaku. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5352.339999999999s)]
*  So yeah, cause I'm fascinated by this kind of shit. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5353.179999999999s)]
*  The problem with two people talking is like, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5356.219999999999s)]
*  I gotta like lock in on these dudes. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5358.139999999999s)]
*  I just wanna listen. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5360.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I'd want you to chime in too. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5361.259999999999s)]
*  That with some of these people, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5364.099999999999s)]
*  like you have to have one-on-one. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5366.099999999999s)]
*  Because even if I do two guests, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5367.62s)]
*  like everybody always has something cool to say, right? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5370.0599999999995s)]
*  And then someone else is talking [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5373.339999999999s)]
*  and you wanna, it's hard. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5375.54s)]
*  It's hard to like work it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5376.74s)]
*  And when you got someone who's talking about something [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5378.42s)]
*  like very esoteric, very difficult to grasp, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5380.66s)]
*  they're talking about like quantum physics. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5384.86s)]
*  They're trying to explain to you [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5386.9s)]
*  the dynamics of these subatomic particles. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5389.139999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5393.38s)]
*  You need like one person just locked on. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5394.74s)]
*  Every time I hear quantum physicists talk, [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5397.0199999999995s)]
*  I never understand everything they say. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5399.42s)]
*  Bro, I barely understand a fraction [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5402.26s)]
*  of what they're talking about. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5405.5s)]
*  Even when they talking about other shit. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5406.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5408.26s)]
*  They're operating on a different level. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5409.66s)]
*  Like Eric Weiss trying to give you a recipe. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5411.06s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5413.820000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ man. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5415.780000000001s)]
*  Weinstein's crazy smart in a spooky way. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5418.18s)]
*  I know, but he's like, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5421.06s)]
*  he forgets how much smarter than. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5421.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5423.9800000000005s)]
*  He'll talk to you in a way that like, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5424.820000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what you're saying. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5426.1s)]
*  Yeah, but like I don't have that degree, bro. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5427.1s)]
*  Yeah, well he has a theory of everything. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5429.02s)]
*  I do not understand it at all. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5431.78s)]
*  I don't know how many people could follow it. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5433.82s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5435.74s)]
*  But that kind of person that would sit around [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5436.7s)]
*  and try to create a theory of everything. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5438.3s)]
*  He's of the belief that potentially [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5441.42s)]
*  we're looking at the US made stuff [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5443.98s)]
*  that's like super advanced [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5446.58s)]
*  and that they put a lid on it somehow. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5448.42s)]
*  But what would be the purpose of that? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5450.34s)]
*  Because I think if you develop something in secrecy, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5452.3s)]
*  like they do all the time with like the stealth bomber, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5456.7s)]
*  all these different things, even the Manhattan Project. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5459.46s)]
*  You develop things in secrecy. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5462.06s)]
*  And then there comes a time where you test them, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5463.26s)]
*  you use them, you have them. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5467.62s)]
*  But then are you gonna admit you have them? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5469.46s)]
*  Because then the enemy is gonna infiltrate. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5470.86s)]
*  They're gonna find out you have them. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5472.66s)]
*  There's espionage. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5474.06s)]
*  They're gonna steal your information. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5474.9s)]
*  They've been doing that forever. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5475.9400000000005s)]
*  We talked about these back doors that China has [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5476.9400000000005s)]
*  and all our electronics or potentially could have, right? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5479.02s)]
*  How many things are vulnerable because of AI now? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5481.7s)]
*  How many things are vulnerable [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5484.06s)]
*  because everything's attached to the internet? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5485.14s)]
*  How many things can be hacked? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5486.62s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5488.18s)]
*  But the reality is we're in like [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5489.54s)]
*  a very uniquely vulnerable position [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5493.18s)]
*  in terms of if someone did have that kind of technology [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5497.74s)]
*  that could take over AI systems, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5501.38s)]
*  that could kill the power grid, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5503.82s)]
*  that could fly things through the sky autonomously, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5505.74s)]
*  that move at speeds that are impossible to imagine [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5509.14s)]
*  with conventional aircraft. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5512.26s)]
*  And can really, like you said, park it over the White House. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5513.58s)]
*  Maybe part of what he's saying is true. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5517.06s)]
*  Maybe he really did write that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5518.74s)]
*  Maybe someone wrote that and it's like some truths [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5520.34s)]
*  and some wacky shit to try to throw you off of the truth, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5522.86s)]
*  which is also a strategy that gets used. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5526.0199999999995s)]
*  When you have something that's like a real conspiracy, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5528.98s)]
*  you know what you do? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5530.86s)]
*  You attach it to a bunch of other shit [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5531.7s)]
*  like witchcraft, voodoo, fucking ghosts. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5532.58s)]

*  What are you gonna do? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5570.22s)]
*  Like you walk in the green room [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5571.06s)]
*  and you see me changing heads. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5571.9s)]

*  Oh yeah, it was great. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5586.34s)]
*  It's fucking great. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5587.18s)]
*  Actually, I saw it. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5588.02s)]
*  That was the first time I actually enjoyed [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5589.26s)]
*  one of those, I don't know, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5592.5s)]
*  they call them 4D or D-Box. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5593.94s)]
*  Where they got the smoke and all that shit. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5596.06s)]
*  Oh, you went to one of those places? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5598.9s)]
*  I saw that movie, yeah. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5600.46s)]
*  Oh, that's a good move. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5601.3s)]
*  And the thing is, it's not a consistent experience yet, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5603.78s)]
*  but that was the best one I've had so far. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5607.46s)]
*  Especially when I realized you could turn the water off. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5609.54s)]
*  Because when the aliens spray, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5612.0199999999995s)]
*  some of the shit get on you and shit. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5614.7s)]
*  It's like a spray from the ceiling. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5616.54s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I'm having a good time. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5618.34s)]
*  But I don't wanna get wet. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5620.5s)]
*  But can I turn this fucking water off? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5621.34s)]
*  But you can, I just didn't realize it for way too long. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5623.66s)]
*  It was the first of these alien movies [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5625.46s)]
*  since the original that captured the spirit [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5627.66s)]
*  of the original one. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5629.82s)]
*  The fear of going through the corridors, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5630.98s)]
*  not knowing where that thing is, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5633.06s)]
*  it hunting you, the way it got to those people. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5634.5s)]
*  That was a good alien movie. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5638.18s)]
*  I think that was the best alien movie since Alien 1. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5639.9800000000005s)]
*  I think. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5644.22s)]
*  Alien 2 was like that though. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5645.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but Alien 2, they were too easy to kill. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5647.580000000001s)]
*  I didn't like how they could just gun them down. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5649.9800000000005s)]
*  But you're right, it was the same sort of, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5651.780000000001s)]
*  I don't know, Prometheus was kind of the same [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5654.02s)]
*  kind of spirit too. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5655.740000000001s)]
*  Prometheus was pretty good. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5656.580000000001s)]
*  Covenant was better. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5658.3s)]
*  I liked Covenant. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5659.820000000001s)]
*  Covenant was really good. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5660.9400000000005s)]
*  Michael Fassbender, he's the shit. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5661.9s)]
*  I didn't like Prometheus until the second time I watched it. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5663.58s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5666.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because this wasn't what I was expecting. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5667.98s)]
*  It's like I, but once I saw it on its own merit, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5670.139999999999s)]
*  I think Covenant's better. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5674.86s)]
*  Prometheus is pretty good, but they had this story to tell [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5676.179999999999s)]
*  about seeding DNA and the fucking, the operators. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5678.82s)]
*  Oh no, Covenant was the one where they landed. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5681.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5685.7s)]
*  Okay, yeah, that was great. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5686.54s)]
*  The other one was, there was the actual human-like aliens [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5688.34s)]
*  and their planet and they have some war and they all die [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5692.22s)]
*  and this one guy comes to them. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5695.7s)]
*  Remember, these guys? [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5696.78s)]
*  Remember, that's Prometheus. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5698.74s)]
*  I forget what they called them. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5700.54s)]
*  Did they call them the operators? [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5701.38s)]
*  No. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5703.5s)]
*  But it said no xenomorphs. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5704.860000000001s)]
*  But they didn't have a war. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5706.74s)]
*  They were seeding other planets. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5707.860000000001s)]
*  They're gonna do a Prometheus 2. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5710.78s)]
*  It says no xenomorphs in Prometheus 2. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5712.02s)]
*  Oh, they're gonna have a Prometheus 2. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5714.46s)]
*  It's gonna be old articles. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5715.900000000001s)]
*  I hope they do another one. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5718.54s)]
*  Because you have a whole universe of alien possibilities [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5719.86s)]
*  now because they skip timelines and shit. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5723.98s)]
*  This one is right after the Nostromo gets blown up [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5727.299999999999s)]
*  and they find it and they find the dude, you saw it. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5731.139999999999s)]

*  Well, you know what was double about Aliens 1 and, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5734.94s)]

*  Prometheus? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5740.9s)]
*  No, no, the latest one. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5741.74s)]
*  Oh, god, what did I call it? [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5743.299999999999s)]
*  Romulus. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5745.98s)]
*  What they had in common was like, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5746.98s)]
*  the protagonist didn't know what they were dealing with. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5749.179999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5752.099999999999s)]
*  So that's what made it more exciting. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5752.94s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5754.7s)]

*  It's the creepiest vampire movie ever. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5900.58s)]
*  So you're saying it's better than Blade? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5903.26s)]
*  Blade was awesome, but Blade was a superhero movie. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5905.58s)]
*  More than it was a. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5908.3s)]
*  So you don't count Blade as a vampire movie? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5909.14s)]
*  It was a vampire movie in that the superhero [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5910.9400000000005s)]
*  had to kill the vampires, but it's a Marvel comic guy. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5913.46s)]
*  I've known Blade since I was a teenager. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5916.0199999999995s)]
*  I was into Marvel comics. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5918.0599999999995s)]
*  So Blade's a vampire movie the way [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5919.459999999999s)]
*  that Die Hard's a Christmas movie. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5920.66s)]
*  Yeah, Blade was a badass martial artist [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5922.179999999999s)]
*  who was half vampire, who was fucking up vampires. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5924.379999999999s)]
*  He was the daywalker. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5927.179999999999s)]
*  It's a fun superhero movie, more than anything. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5928.179999999999s)]
*  But the movie wasn't really about the vampires. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5930.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5932.139999999999s)]
*  It was like they were the enemy and he was the good guy. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5933.259999999999s)]
*  That was the movie. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5935.78s)]
*  The movie was essentially, you know, revenge. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5936.98s)]
*  They killed Riddler. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5939.099999999999s)]
*  Oh shit, you know. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5940.179999999999s)]
*  So what about like, what's the one, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5941.339999999999s)]
*  the teenage heartthrobby one that kind of ruined it? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5943.98s)]
*  Oh, Twilight? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5946.34s)]

*  But do you consider those vampire movies? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5948.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, those are vampire movies. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5949.0599999999995s)]
*  They're fun, they're fun. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5950.62s)]

*  that girls like that I don't like. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5954.9s)]
*  I don't have to like it for it to be good. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5956.26s)]
*  Obviously it made hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5958.1s)]
*  People love those movies. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5961.0199999999995s)]

*  it doesn't have to be good for me to like it. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5963.94s)]
*  Cause there's a lot of people that like bad movies. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5965.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5967.74s)]
*  I can't get with it. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=5968.58s)]

*  Let's try not to spoil it for Brian. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6039.82s)]
*  What he looks like? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6042.82s)]

*  I don't know. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6045.7s)]
*  Really? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6046.54s)]
*  But it's based on the image, the way he looks [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6047.38s)]
*  is based on the original Legend of Dracula, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6049.54s)]
*  which was a guy named Vlad the Impaler. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6052.26s)]
*  Oh, he was real? [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6055.78s)]
*  Yeah, this is what he looks like in this. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6056.6s)]
*  But you gotta see it. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6059.02s)]
*  This is a very toned down version of it. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6060.66s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6063.9s)]
*  If you like a good, scary horror movie, [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6065.26s)]
*  it's the best vampire movie. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6067.38s)]
*  He said it was a big reveal, and I love a reveal. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6068.22s)]
*  It's a great reveal. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6069.34s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6070.82s)]
*  And they drag it out. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6071.78s)]
*  You get to see him kind of in the beginning, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6074.1s)]
*  and then eventually you get to really see him. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6076.22s)]
*  And you're like, oh my god. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6078.34s)]
*  And this isn't my take. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6079.9400000000005s)]
*  I've heard other people talk about it like this, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6080.78s)]
*  but that's the other thing that made Alien great, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6081.9400000000005s)]
*  was like, you don't always show the monster. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6083.78s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6088.38s)]
*  Because horror is seeing the monster [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6091.18s)]

*  So then they had the comic books [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6387.099999999999s)]
*  and then they had illustrated books. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6388.98s)]
*  And then I think that was the first Conan movie was Arnold. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6391.3s)]
*  I think he was the first Conan movie. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6396.099999999999s)]
*  And there's been a few attempts since then, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6398.26s)]
*  but no one has really captured the books, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6400.46s)]
*  like stylistically, except for like the Jason Momoa movie. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6404.38s)]
*  But the movie just wasn't that good. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6408.3s)]
*  It just wasn't a, someone needs to, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6410.58s)]
*  you need like a real, like a Robert Eggers, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6412.34s)]
*  the guy who did this Nosferatu movie. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6415.1s)]

*  It would be sick. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6428.7s)]
*  But it has to be like a realistic movie. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6430.02s)]
*  It has to be a movie of this realistic warrior [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6433.18s)]
*  encountering these crazy things. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6436.860000000001s)]

*  Too much suspension of disbelief. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6443.14s)]
*  It's gotta be like a wild movie based. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6444.700000000001s)]
*  The Northman. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6447.780000000001s)]

*  This kind of movie is exactly like [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6454.5s)]
*  what Conan would have to be. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6456.900000000001s)]
*  That movie's fucking great. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6459.1s)]
*  That's like one of the best Viking movies. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6461.46s)]
*  It's not the best one ever. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6463.3s)]
*  It's actually dark as hell. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6464.14s)]
*  Really good movie. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6465.46s)]
*  Oh, there's no good guys in that movie. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6466.62s)]
*  That movie's crazy and probably representative [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6468.94s)]
*  of the real life of Vikings, the way they really lived. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6472.06s)]
*  Because they were fucking ruthless. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6475.74s)]
*  That movie's great, but it's also got like, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6479.02s)]
*  it was supernatural in it. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6480.7s)]
*  There's a lot of cool shit in that movie. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6482.58s)]

*  I mean, they believed in a lot of supernatural shit. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6485.06s)]
*  If that guy directed Conan, holy shit. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6487.22s)]
*  Then you would get to see the real books. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6490.54s)]
*  Because the Robert E. Howard books were great. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6492.58s)]
*  So the same guy who did Nosferatu did Northman? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=6494.42s)]

*  Uniquely preposterous. No, but you know the earth is flat, you know, Christopher Hitchens, right? Sure [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7350.660000000001s)]
*  He made his whole career like [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7354.620000000001s)]
*  Debating Christians and Muslims. Mm-hmm. He would like go to their churches and debate their right and somebody asked him one time [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7356.54s)]
*  Like hey, if you could if you could snap your fingers and make all religion just go away [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7364.34s)]
*  Like would you do that? He was like honestly, you know, cuz I just like arguing with them too much [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7370.26s)]
*  You know or something to that effect those one is exact words, but it was like I think [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7376.02s)]
*  I think you gotta be a special kind of person to be like no, I want all the smoke [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7379.78s)]
*  I want to argue [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7385.18s)]
*  Directly with people that I don't think well Christopher Hitchens was uniquely brilliant and he was so good at forming arguments and [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7387.540000000001s)]
*  Sentences and he was his grasp of the language was so [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7394.820000000001s)]
*  Expert he was a great speaker amazing amazing speaker so that he would have these conversations these people and they'd be like woefully underprepared [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7398.660000000001s)]
*  They just they couldn't handle he also has an incredible amount of knowledge when it comes to religion [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7406.580000000001s)]
*  Whether it's Christianity or Islam and and he'll call out everything that has ever happened [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7412.4s)]
*  That's terrible that every one of them was done and he knows that information at the tip of his fingers at any given time [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7418.24s)]
*  I grew up religious and he was the one that made me be like [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7424.0s)]
*  He makes some very very very compelling logical arguments [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7427.96s)]
*  There's also the problem with religion is that there's so many of them too and they're so different and they all think that they have [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7432.5199999999995s)]
*  The right one that that's a real problem [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7438.48s)]
*  But I think the desire for religion seems to be a part of the structure of our thinking [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7440.759999999999s)]
*  It's like one of those things that reoccurs everywhere. There's groups of people [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7447.44s)]
*  there's a [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7451.36s)]
*  desire for meaning and then there's a [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7452.44s)]
*  Connection to a higher power that we all seem to agree is not just likely but you feel its presence every now and then [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7455.32s)]
*  But also it's like the we were puzzle-solving. Yeah [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7462.4s)]
*  The need to have an answer to the puzzle, oh, yeah, and also to have a daddy [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7466.52s)]
*  We always want someone who is above us whether it's the president or the mayor or your father [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7471.52s)]
*  whoever it is you you want some person who's looking out for you and [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7477.04s)]
*  It is watching over everything and as a plan for all until your God gets home. Yeah [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7481.92s)]
*  Wait, do you God is watching jerk off? Oh, man [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7486.72s)]
*  That that fucked me up for a little while when I was like, you know [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7490.400000000001s)]
*  That was watching all the time because we used to go when I was little we I would get there was a church [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7493.879999999999s)]
*  There was also a school. I know they were a Christian school, but on Sunday [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7498.36s)]
*  They use a school buses to go pick up kids just like school, but it was for church [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7502.839999999999s)]
*  Mmm, and and you know, we got sent to that, you know, it wasn't even the church [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7506.959999999999s)]
*  My grandmother went to she just sent us to this one. What is better an overly religious? [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7512.0s)]
*  childhood or a childhood filled with crime and violence [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7516.919999999999s)]
*  Clearly overly religious right that's better because you can learn your way out of some stupid shit that they talked you into when you were young [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7520.4s)]
*  depending on what the religion is but [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7527.4s)]
*  Crime and violence gets you killed someone else gets killed you go to jail. It's not good [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7530.44s)]
*  Like it's definitely better in terms of like what is more compatible with society to grow up very religious with very strict rules [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7535.32s)]
*  And then maybe as you get older you sort of recognize that [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7542.32s)]
*  I mean doesn't it depend on which religion it does it definitely does it definitely does I mean you have some religious we get a gang of [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7546.44s)]
*  wise whoo [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7553.44s)]
*  Sounds like more trouble than it's worth. Yes [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7556.839999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the reason why the Mormons moved to Mexico [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7559.48s)]
*  They moved to Mexico. You don't know about that. They didn't either you saw no more. Listen when [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7563.12s)]
*  Mitch [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7567.5199999999995s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7568.96s)]
*  The fucking guy ran for president. Oh, I [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7570.48s)]
*  Fucking ran for president. Oh [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7573.76s)]
*  Rob Mitt Romney Mitt Mitt that's why I was fucking up Mitt Romney Mitt Romney's dad was born in Mexico [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7577.04s)]
*  So his dad couldn't be president, but Mitt was born in America [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7583.12s)]
*  Mitt Romney's family was Mormon and they moved to Mexico in the 1800s because of religious persecution [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7587.2s)]
*  And part of that was [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7594.88s)]
*  polygamy [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7596.88s)]
*  They made polygamy illegal. So these guys will fuck it. This is like the 1800s [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7598.08s)]
*  Mexico ain't no different than America in the 1800s before cars. Everyone's on a horse. You got a house whatever same shit [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7602.96s)]
*  Let's go to Mexico. They went to Mexico and to this day they have giant Mormon compounds in [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7610.04s)]
*  Mexico and then recently there was a situation like they're armed to protect themselves against the cartel [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7617.120000000001s)]
*  it's like wild shit goes down and one of I think it was like a [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7622.84s)]
*  Family was killed I think it might have been an accident the cartel [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7627.6s)]
*  Mistook them for someone else or someone did and there's like this real problem [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7632.12s)]
*  They get rid of him. I don't know what happened [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7635.76s)]
*  I don't remember how the story went down [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7638.32s)]
*  But I remember it was a big international story and then everybody was like wait what's going on? [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7640.12s)]
*  There's giant camps of armed Mormons in Mexico [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7644.44s)]
*  You know, they don't fuck around like why did they why did they move to Mexico? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7648.74s)]
*  And that's why they moved to Mexico because they have religious freedom [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7652.16s)]
*  They don't know religious or I bet you the Mormons got an app. Oh, they probably have an app. Yeah, but like [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7654.4s)]
*  That's the story right that they were killed by the cartel. I think it was a woman and her child was killed by the cartel [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7661.879999999999s)]

*  Here's what we know about the attack. The victims were all shot while in the vehicles while driving [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7696.16s)]
*  Investigators believe the three vehicles traveling between the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7702.799999999999s)]

*  I think they always have because this is this is why they don't make sense to me [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7756.400000000001s)]
*  They don't say that it says it's not clear if the attacks were specifically targeted or if the family was a case of mistaken identity [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7759.56s)]
*  You don't accidentally shoot the wrong caravan [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7766.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, what's the chances that is another caravan look just like you? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7768.88s)]
*  Well, here's what it says it said Castaneda said there were long-standing tensions between the families and the cartels [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7771.64s)]
*  He said one of the women killed was an activist and there were frictions over water rights. Oh [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7776.64s)]
*  Jesus Christ [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7781.64s)]
*  Whoo scary dog [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7785.0s)]
*  Yeah [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7789.88s)]

*  Yeah, but imagine living in a place that's controlled by the cartel like, you know, the government has its faults in the United States [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7794.72s)]
*  But it's a superior system. Hasn't the Mexican government like started cracking down on the cartel? [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7801.120000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't know they did this just somewhere. I mean, I'm pretty sure the dude is a dictator [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7804.8s)]
*  But he just he just locked everybody up Venezuela. It's Venezuela [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7811.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they just they they literally imprisoned all the gang members [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7814.8s)]
*  Every single even if he was a if he was associated [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7818.36s)]
*  They made these giant prisons and they just filled the prisons up with gang members and the stop the crime just stopped [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7821.16s)]
*  Mmm, but that was the immediate effect. Is this still the case then? I don't know. It's good question [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7828.12s)]
*  Like, you know, is that what they're gonna do forever? They're just gonna keep these guys in that cage for the rest of their lives [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7832.5199999999995s)]
*  That's expensive. It is expensive [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7837.04s)]
*  But is it less expensive than letting them wreak havoc and ruin your entire community? I don't know [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7839.08s)]
*  It's a very totalitarian thing [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7845.76s)]
*  What's also depends on like how many of those people were set up how many people weren't actually in a gang how many people were [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7849.0s)]
*  Like maybe somebody doesn't like you [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7854.080000000001s)]
*  I mean probably a little bit of that going on type of situation was like a drastic change [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7855.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they rounded up hundreds of thousands of people. There's gonna be a couple of revenge joints slipped in there [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7858.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah crazy, oh El Salvador, it's not it's not Venezuela, it's El Salvador look at that [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7867.96s)]
*  My god [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7876.120000000001s)]
*  They just said fuck it. We're just gonna take crime down to zero. So this is life in prison. Well, you know what man? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7877.72s)]
*  I mean, is this better? It seems like it's better than having the criminals run society and kill everybody [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7884.0s)]
*  I mean, but at least like give them on some bicycles providing free power or something [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7889.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, what have they done, you know, but also if you grow up in that community [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7893.6s)]
*  What are you gonna do? Like if you grow up and your whole family's involved in the gangs like [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=7897.72s)]

*  Yeah, you think about all these different variables. You know I used to say that to my students when they would fight [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8288.859999999999s)]
*  Because a lot of them that were really smart I would notice they would be much more nervous [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8297.26s)]
*  dumb kids martial arts [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8302.62s)]

*  The reason why you're scared is because you're aware of all the variables and you know you're vulnerable [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8328.02s)]
*  Whereas dumb people don't think that they're overconfident and they're not aware of all the variables, but you can overcome this [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8332.58s)]
*  I'll be like I did it too. I have the same feeling. I don't want to do it. It's stupid [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8338.74s)]
*  Why am I doing this? Why am I risking my health? Why am I risking my safety? [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8342.66s)]
*  You have all those thoughts that are gonna go in your head [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8345.74s)]
*  But you're gonna learn something about yourself from doing this and you're smart and that's why you're nervous and you should be nervous [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8347.5s)]

*  With overcoming anxiety to compete because they're aware of how fucking dangerous this actually is they're not blissfully unaware [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8375.820000000002s)]
*  Like a moron is walking into a cage fight not knowing they might get knocked the fuck out [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8383.54s)]
*  You know not gonna happen to me, bro. There's a lot of those not gonna happen to me bro guys [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8388.26s)]

*  Yeah, it's gonna be rough because it's amazing to me like that's another like we talk about like a see us like that but but [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8407.98s)]
*  MMA wise John Jones is like [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8416.179999999998s)]
*  Equivalent to Floyd Mayweather in terms of like how little damage he's taking over [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8419.259999999998s)]
*  Yes, there was a few fights where they were real rough the Dominic Reyes fight was real rough [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8422.939999999999s)]
*  He got hit a bunch of times in that fight [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8427.06s)]
*  He got caught a few times by leota machita before he put him to sleep [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8429.26s)]
*  Leota was catching him a few he hit him with one big left hand Rashad Evans clipped him with a big right hand [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8432.699999999999s)]
*  But for the most part John is the very best at utilizing distance and also having a strategy [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8437.58s)]
*  He said that was the hardest he ever got hit Rashad Rashad. Yeah, Rashad knocked [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8443.06s)]

*  No Chuck Liddell had gotten stopped by rampage and pride, okay [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8454.22s)]
*  And then Chuck Liddell, I mean he'd been stopped a few times. I mean like I think show guns [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8458.3s)]
*  No because [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8465.099999999999s)]
*  Rampage stopped him during his rise like rampage stopped him when the UFC when he was a champ in the or maybe he wasn't [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8466.66s)]
*  The champ he was like the best guy or one like kills like Tito was the champ for a little before Chuck fought Tito and everybody [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8473.66s)]
*  Knew that Chuck was gonna beat Tito [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8480.539999999999s)]
*  It was one of those things really like this is a bad matchup because Chuck is a really good wrestler and just a [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8482.14s)]
*  Ferocious striker ferocious and so aggressive and just nasty power and just would throw himself into the wars [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8486.9s)]
*  Throw him so he had an iron chin [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8494.66s)]
*  So you just fuck you we just throw himself and really skillful too man like underrated skills [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8496.62s)]
*  But just a desire for the firefight that was like nobody else [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8502.82s)]
*  But rampage beat him rampage stopped him in pride so they had an exchange where they were gonna send UFC fighters over to [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8508.02s)]
*  over to pride to fight the best pride guys and Chuck was one of the best UFC guys and rampage stopped him and [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8515.5s)]
*  Chuck fought Alistair over him and Alistair over him was doing really well, but Alistair's team Chuck stopped Alistair [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8522.980000000001s)]
*  Just that this though rampage used to yeah. Oh bro. This was when Chuck was Chuck right? [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8529.980000000001s)]

*  Rampage eventually I believe he stopped him with like body shots on the ground if I remember correctly [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8547.26s)]
*  I remember he just beat him up and then they stopped the fight. I [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8552.34s)]
*  think he just got on top of him at one point in time it was a grueling fucking fight though, but I [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8556.380000000001s)]

*  He was just beating him down and eventually I stopped the fight [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8564.82s)]
*  So these punches to the face and then just dig into the body tiny that referee is I know [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8567.86s)]

*  But this is when this is way past his pride Chuck right? No, he was in his prime man. He was still in his prime [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8687.54s)]
*  He was the champion [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8692.5s)]
*  Chuck was the champion at this point in time, but but rampage was fucking good man [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8695.74s)]

*  That's how you win the title [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8743.060000000001s)]
*  Chuck's confused, but you know that's what happens when you get knocked out. You don't know what the fuck happened [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8747.18s)]

*  And then they dive for the referee's legs, and they think they're still fighting they take the referee down [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8758.62s)]
*  I've seen the dude swinging at the ref. Oh, yeah, they don't know what's happening [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8763.42s)]
*  I mean a lot of these guys are on like full fight or flight after they get tagged [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8766.54s)]
*  They're just in it's just chaos. They don't know what they're saying referees get hit all the time [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8771.02s)]

*  Politely imagine like Francis is fighting as Francis fights [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8793.300000000001s)]
*  How are you gonna get Francis off somebody right like how are you even gonna move him? [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8797.74s)]
*  And it's like there's no way that like her being stronger than Francis and gonna be possible [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8801.08s)]
*  But it's like but you got to be strong enough that they feel you like the snap to matter you know yeah [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8805.2s)]

*  He's the gold standard and Big John when he was doing it. He was the gold standard. He stopped [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8828.1s)]
*  Yeah, he does a commentary now John does commentary well [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8831.7s)]
*  He's doing it for Bellator, but I think Bellator is now no longer so he also has a podcast with Josh Thompson [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8835.5s)]
*  That's really good [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8841.58s)]
*  Steve man's yeah, what happened to him is he still the reference? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8843.58s)]
*  Haven't seen him in a while cuz they saw him at a kickboxing event many years later [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8848.26s)]
*  He says like that dude's never gonna work again like that's why should the say in the mean it yeah [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8851.86s)]
*  people make mistakes [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8857.380000000001s)]
*  You know yeah, but what did he what was his fuck up though? He fucked up bad [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8859.140000000001s)]
*  He fucked up a few of them [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8863.34s)]
*  There's a few of those guys that fucked up a few too many fights [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8864.86s)]
*  And then they just you know you just can't after a while [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8867.560000000001s)]
*  We need someone reliable when you got a guy like Mark Goddard who almost never fucks everybody is gonna fuck up [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8870.92s)]
*  They have the second hardest job the first hardest job is the fighter second hardest job is the referee [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8876.14s)]
*  Third hardest job is probably the judge [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8881.539999999999s)]
*  My job's easy [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8885.14s)]
*  Yeah, and the ref the reference they can only see from one angle uh-huh [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8886.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but we miss shit all the time and we have monitors at least the refs have or excuse me the [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8890.82s)]
*  The judges have monitors now. They didn't used to have monitors in the early days. We had a fight to get them monitors [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8897.46s)]
*  We're like we should be able to show them stuff in the replay that the crowd is seeing because sometimes you think a guy [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8903.42s)]
*  Got knocked down, but he didn't he just tripped and it looks like he got knocked down [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8908.6s)]
*  But it really he just got punched on the shoulder and they just fell down [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8912.54s)]
*  That happened in that fight with Islam Makachev and [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8915.94s)]
*  Moicano Moicano caught him with a right hand it looked like he hit him we thought he dropped him [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8919.9s)]
*  but really what happened is he kind of hit him in like the shoulder and [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8926.08s)]
*  They tripped legs together and Islam fell down and then Islam got we thought he was hurt [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8930.06s)]
*  So if you were judging that mean Islam finished him in the first round he subbed him in the first round [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8934.78s)]
*  So it didn't matter [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8940.18s)]
*  But if you saw that fight and if that went to the distance and you said oh my god, he's hurting him [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8940.94s)]
*  He's he's rocking him on the feet you would maybe score that round from Moicano when if you saw the replay [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8947.26s)]
*  Oh, he didn't rock him. He just slipped [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8953.18s)]
*  So you have a monitor can they hear you all too? [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8955.74s)]
*  No, they shouldn't be able to hear us because maybe bias [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8958.06s)]
*  Yeah [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8961.22s)]
*  Maybe we frame it in a way that's different than the way they think it the whole reason to have three different point of views is [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8961.72s)]
*  To have three different expert perspectives. You don't want them hearing what me and DC are saying, right? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8967.06s)]
*  Right, you want them like watching the fight because if we're on someone's nuts, you know, and then this guy's like [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8972.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, he definitely is winning, you know, and maybe the people at home are like fuck you [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8978.34s)]
*  The other guy was winning like there's a few of those fights [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8981.46s)]
*  Yeah, some were [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8984.26s)]
*  It's been a while no has it since it was like a really questionable one, you know [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8986.26s)]
*  It's an interesting one not a questionable one, but an interesting one is Marab versus Umar [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8990.78s)]
*  So Marab Dua Vishwili and Umar number Grimanoff they go to the distance five round fight Marab winds up winning decision [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=8995.42s)]
*  Those are not saying car. Yeah [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9002.54s)]
*  Amazing fight amazing fight probably the best [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9004.54s)]
*  135 pound title fight in the history of sport. It was incredible. It was so well matched [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9008.1s)]
*  They went back and forth Umar apparently broke his hand in the first round was still throwing it for the whole fight [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9012.5s)]
*  He took he wound up taking Marab down and nobody expected that he got Marab's back [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9017.82s)]
*  He won the first two rounds and the question is the third round [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9022.22s)]
*  And so I watched it a couple of times and me and John Anik and Daniel Cormier been going back and forth with text [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9026.119999999999s)]
*  About this I was like man that third round is so close. It's so close. I could see judges giving it to Umar [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9031.5s)]
*  He landed more strikes on the feet. He did get one takedown Marab got a couple takedowns [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9038.62s)]
*  But he didn't do much with the takedown [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9043.2s)]
*  but Daniel had a really good point that at the end of it Marab's was accelerating and it looked like [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9045.820000000002s)]
*  Umar was starting to get tired. See I thought see I tuned in at that point [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9052.02s)]
*  I started that pay-per-view at that third round [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9056.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so I hadn't seen the previous two rounds, but at the end of the third round Umar has Marab's back [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9059.18s)]
*  He's behind him and he's controlling him against the cage and he had wound up taking Marab down at one point in time [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9065.68s)]
*  So it's like he landed a lot of strikes on the feet [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9071.720000000001s)]
*  Like probably did more actual damage [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9075.16s)]
*  But Marab did take him down more and Marab was pushing the pace and Marab did also land shots [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9078.4s)]
*  Like it was close [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9085.08s)]
*  it's the third round that's the real close one because I gave the first two rounds to Umar and [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9086.480000000001s)]
*  Then you get into the third you're like, ooh, that's the one that one's close [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9090.880000000001s)]
*  Because the fourth and the fifth were clearly Marab was coming on strong Marab was like put it was it was astonishing his endurance [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9095.2s)]
*  Astonishing his fucking cardiovascular systems off the charts [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9103.320000000002s)]
*  His cardio is fucking insanity. It's insanity [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9108.080000000002s)]
*  But I would be very happy to see that fight again. Very happy. I never see Michael Chandler get tired incredible [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9112.800000000001s)]
*  Like I remember his last fight when he lost yeah [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9119.08s)]
*  Yeah, but he's he's sitting there standing up with a motherfucker on his back in the last round. Yeah, like I never see him get tired [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9122.4s)]
*  No, he's an animal. Well, he trains like nobody. I mean his strength and conditioning routines. You can watch them online. They're fucking crazy [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9128.52s)]
*  Cam Haynes went trained with him once [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9136.16s)]
*  He's a maniac [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9138.52s)]
*  But that's his weapon like to have that kind of cardio that kind of discipline to have that kind of cardio [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9139.64s)]
*  Work ethic it's also the work ethic man [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9145.039999999999s)]
*  You have to have that work ethic cuz you he's been doing it for a long time [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9147.88s)]
*  And to still have that work ethic what I mean even the best the best people in the world they get tired of it [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9151.88s)]
*  You know, yeah, he's not tired of it man. He's definitely not tired of it. He's still exciting [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9157.96s)]
*  I mean Olivera is one of the best in the world. He had Olivera hurt in that third round [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9162.279999999999s)]
*  He had him hurt like he had some moments in that third round [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9165.96s)]
*  We're like, holy shit like this is a real fight and Olivera is as good as it gets [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9168.48s)]

*  Got him in the first fight though first fight he KO'd him remember him hit him with that clean left hook [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9180.24s)]

*  Chandler had him real hurt in the first round rocked on the on his back [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9186.4s)]
*  Fighting him off in the first round and then they start the second round Chandler moves straight to him and Olivera just pieces him up [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9189.960000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I do remember. Yeah, I do. Oh, he had one a clean left hook. It was clean [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCf4SogPpI&t=9196.74s)]
